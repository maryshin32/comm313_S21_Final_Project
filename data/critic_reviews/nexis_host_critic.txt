  Mar. 8, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- 
 If there.s one film that will plant South Korean cinema into the mind of the American public, The Host is it. Bong Joon-ho.s lively feature provides all the thrills and sensation of the average American summer spectacle, except that it does so while still remaining a good movie. It.s got heart, hilarity, triumph and tragedy as it gives us a fractured family that finally sets aside their differences and unites towards a common goal. It.s also got a giant mutant fish-monster that tries to eat everything in its path.

Still with me? That.s the kind of film that The Host is - able to shift tones on a moment.s notice (often within the same scene), Bong uses all his formidable talents to bring respect to a disreputable genre. And thanks to his sure hand, somehow it all comes together.

The genesis of this giant mutant fish-monster comes in the year 2000 prologue, when an American government official, over the objections of his Korean subordinate, orders the disposal of several hundred bottles of formaldehyde (they were dusty). Flash forward to the present, when the monster crawls out of the Han River one fine summer day and wreaks a whole ton of havoc. 
 This is a spellbinding sequence - the first glimmer of the rampage comes when layabout snack-booth merchant Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) casually turns to his left and sees the beast running full bore at him, trampling or swallowing everyone in between, and the rest of the sequence has that same disbelieving, half-glimpsed quality about it. Most effective is the first tail whip, which would be played as a major shock-cut in Hollywood but here is viewed from a distance, which makes it somehow both more horrifying and weirdly funny. 

The attack is all the more impressive for coming not fifteen minutes into a two-hour film; in lieu of arduous story setup, Bong quickly introduces the members of the Park family and jumps straight into the action, leaving the rest to be filled in on the fly as the remainder of the film proceeds. A significant portion of the family is elsewhere at the time -- Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) is on television attempting to win a gold medal in archery, while Nam-il (Park Hae-il) we learn of only in Gang-du.s conversation with his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung) about his showing up at parent-teacher day in place of the shiftless, borderline-narcoleptic Gang-du. 
 Among other things, Bong demonstrates with The Host that he.s adept at the art of storytelling shorthand. In this early scene alone, he gives us quick sketches of five characters without feeling expository or leaving the snack shack run by Gang-du.s father Hie-bong (Byoen Hie-bong), while simultaneously emphasizing the spatial separateness that is reflected by the family.s emotional divisions. Both of these gulfs are closed in short order by a horrific event, and that.s when the meat of The Host arrives on the scene.

It.s a hell of an event, too: During the opening monster mash, Gang-du loses sight of where he.s going, stumbles and accidentally lets go of Hyun-seo.s hand. Just as he realizes his error, he turns to see Hyun-seo being swept up and carried away by the monster.s tail. 
 Initially thinking her dead, the family is crushed. One night, though, Gang-du gets a call; the reception is full of static and the voice on the other end is difficult to hear, but it.s definitely Hyun-seo. Before her cell phone dies, she manages to get across that she.s alive in a sewer somewhere. The family then resolves to band together and save her... but first, they have to get out of quarantine. See, Gang-du got monster blood on him, and the monster might be carrying a new virus, so...

As you can see, there.s a lot going on in The Host. I haven.t even touched upon the political dimensions present within the progression of the plot -- it was, after all, the order of an American soldier that caused the mutation in the first place, and as the crisis spins out further, there.s talk of direct intervention. Bong isn.t just indulging in America-bashing, though; the Korean government is consistently displayed as corrupt, inefficient, and incompetent (example: the scene where Gang-du and Hie-bong talk their way through a guard post using quick words, a stolen van, and a bucketful of change). The further along things go, the less willing anyone in charge is to admit mistakes, which leads to some unforeseen narrative complications. By the climactic showdown, the Park family appears to be the only hope for humanity - where the institutions fail, the family will persevere.

Lest I lose sight of my target, though, I might as well confess that this is all thematic gravy and the foremost intent of The Host is to entertain. Bong succeeds in this aim grandly. He throws so many balls in the air that it seems inevitable that some will fall, and while a couple subplots go unresolved, on the whole Bong keeps an admirable balance. 
 He.s also not afraid to puncture the creeping seriousness of the situation with absurd comedy, such as the mourning scene degenerating into a thrashing slugfest between Nam-il and Gang-du or the hazmat-suited soldier who, in the middle of Hie-bong.s vow of vengeance against the beast that assumedly killed his granddaughter and apropos of nothing, slips and falls.

The action scenes are also well-handled. While nothing quite tops the jaw-dropping frisson of the monster.s introductory romp, Bong moves the film along at a crisp pace and keeps the tension at a rolling boil. Whether it.s Nam-il giving an impromptu demonstration of his escape artist skills, Nam-joo attempting to get off an arrow at the monster before it runs her over, or Hyen-seo struggling to sneak out of the monster.s lair without attracting attention, The Host keeps the excitement coming.

It.s the finale, with its confrontation between an exhausted monster and a determined Park family, that drives home the true measure of Bong.s achievement. The mutant fish is a means, not an end. While it.s lots of fun to watch a big ugly something chow down, there needs to be something else down the line if a work of art is going to be more than a forgettable diversion. By not losing sight of the humanity of the situation, The Host succeeds in ways most genre efforts wouldn.t think to consider.

  Mar. 9, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- 
 A nifty little monster movie with post-modernist touches that both add and detract from its effectiveness, writer-director Bong Joon-ho's The Host gets right to the good stuff. After a quick introduction to Gang-du, who works at his family's food stand (sort of a mini 7-Eleven), and his spunky young daughter Hyun-seo, the movie shifts immediately to a strange sight nearby, drawing a crowd to the bank of Seoul's Han River: something is hanging off a bridge right in the middle of its span. 
 Suddenly, it drops into the water, swimming, and the excited crowd watches its approach. They start to throw food -- and cans of beer -- at the shape in the river. But when that shadow comes to the surface, the playful tone shifts, and the film quickly gets scary as hell: the shape is not the least bit friendly, and it immediately starts chasing, and eating, humans.

The Korean title translates as Creature, and indeed the creature is the single most accomplished thing in the movie: a co-creation of two special effects houses, The Orphanage (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Superman Returns) and Weta Workshop (The Lord of the Rings). This very frightening beast is part giant cockroach, part carnivorous tadpole, with the terrifying multiple fanged mouths of Alien's alien, plus a really long tongue. Whenever It is on screen, or even threatening to appear, this is a splendidly effective scare picture.

But Bong Joon-ho has other things on his mind. The store-owning family members are a vivid group of eccentrics, and they become outlaws on the run after one of them is snatched by the creature and the authorities refuse to help them rescue her. The family escapes from the quarantine that has been imposed, and ventures out to find the monster's lair. The American title, The Host, is ironic: the behavior of the police and the national health officials is handled with sometimes bitter satire, as they come to the conclusion that the creature has introduced a deadly new virus into the world. The authorities (and a mob of conformists following their orders) become co-villains in the story -- but they act out of blind stupidity, while the creature itself is only doing what comes naturally.

In its mix of superb film craft with sophomoric jokes, slapstick, shocking violence and sometimes satirical social commentary, The Host reminds me of another recent movie from Korea, Park Chan-wook's Lady Vengeance. The disparate elements don't always gel, and American genre fans expecting an ordinary sort of action picture are likely to be unhappy with some of the odd, and sad, plot twists -- but after seeing either The Host or Lady Vengeance, you know you're in the presence of a major talent. (Both of these movies played at the New York Film Festival, and roused crowds accustomed to rather more sedate fare. Bong's earlier film, Memories of Murder, available on DVD, is also a genre picture with downbeat twists, and it has some interesting similarities to, and differences from, the new film Zodiac.)

The photography and editing of The Host are top-notch. The Han River location is vividly evoked, and the chases that take place near -- and beneath -- the river bank are breathtakingly well done. The Park family's journey isn't very long geographically, but it takes on the nature of a heroic quest, even though as heroes they have their ups and downs. Gang-du's sister Nam-joo (played by Bae Doo-na) is a champion archer (well, a bronze medalist) whose Achilles heel is being a little too&hellip; slow to let the arrow fly -- and this becomes a witty visual joke at various points in the movie. Their brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il) seems at first a worthless, belligerent young drunk, but he proves his worth as the adventure continues. Gang-du himself is a bit of a goofy, shiftless layabout, but as events give his life a grim purpose, actor Song Kang-ho skillfully transforms the character into a real hero of sorts. (Actors Park and Song were also in Memories of Murder.)

The plot is sometimes sketchy, unc onvincing, even silly, as is the satirical way the army and health officials are portrayed. But the movie has enough energy to ride over these faults. When the family's quest takes a tragic turn, however, it feels like a miscalculation -- the tone has been mostly fast and smartass up to that point, and one may not know how to react to the jarring shift. This may be just what director Bong has in mind, however, being a bit of an absurdist, gleefully mixing the comic and the sad.

So you may or may not feel completely satisfied by the story itself. But if you're a monster movie aficionado, this is a monster you won't want to miss. And if you're interested in the Asian movies that have been expanding and subverting genres, such as Lady Vengeance and Infernal Affairs (the Hong Kong film on which The Departed is based), Bong Joon-ho is a director to watch -- and The Host is a good place to start. 
Handyguy (aka Randall Byrn) is a marketing director at a business magazine's conference division in New York. A transplanted Southerner, he has been a movie buff since birth. He's always secretly wanted to be Pauline Kael, and blogcritics gives him an approximation of that, or so he likes to fantasize at least. Handy has a film degree from USC.

Movie review: The Host ****: Korean monster movie is horribly charming

Apr. 27--Science gone wrong!
A military mobilized!
An (Asian) nation terrified!
A creature who would not die!
With 1,000 teeth! 10,000 eyes!
From the ocean floor!
Sigh.
As a moviegoer who grew up on Boston's Creature Double Feature (back-to-back marauding-giant-monster movies, every Saturday afternoon on a scratchy UHF channel), as a rational adult who pays taxes and buys milk, as a journalist who goes to movies for a living, I must say, it is one of the disappointments of my professional life that big green slimy beasts, with legs as thick as redwoods and claws that tear up pavement, climbing from a toxic river to lay waste to a feckless mankind, are far too rare.
I see 17 talking animal cartoons a year. I watch 34 odd serial killer pictures, and catch a baker's dozen of war movies and my share of films about horny teenagers. I sit though 73 films every 12 months with Judi Dench and/or Jude Law -- but the descendants of Godzilla have remained, oddly, trapped in the primordial ooze from whence they came.
Laugh, snicker -- put The Queen at the top of your Netflix queue for all I care!
A puckish new South Korean export, The Host, which opens in Toledo today, makes a convincing, and playfully deranged, argument that the giant-monster genre is far more malleable than we imagined.
Yes, it's a monster movie, first and foremost, sure. But oh, it argues, your typical Asian monster mash can be a dysfunctional family drama, or a political satire, a cautionary environmental warning, or a straight-out comedy, a governmental farce about ineffectual bureaucrats, or a metaphor for the American military presence in South Korea, or a reminder of the ingenuity of children -- and so on.
Director Bong Joon-ho, who indeed grew up not far from a U.S. military base, picks all of the above. As messy as the overall shebang may be -- here is a picture in a constant pitched battle over what mood or point it wants to convey -- it's not overstating to say it handles every last one of those far-flung goals, individually, with equal wit and grace. In fact, that shaggy, loose-limbed quality is what makes it more than a monster movie. It's got charm to spare. Since its premiere last year in South Korea, The Host has become the biggest smash in that country's history, a literal Bong hit; and when I saw it last October at the New York Film Festival (I've since seen it two more times), the crush of highbrow cinema snobs pushing to get into a midnight screening threatened to become a black-rectangular-eyeglass-frame battle royale.
Still not convinced?
Two images stick.
The first is the initial, lyrical sighting of the monster -which is something else, let me tell you. We are witness to a Day Everything Changed, though it starts out a Day Like Any Other. Families picnic and dogs bark and the sun shines along the Han River, a wide strip of water that cuts through downtown Seoul. A line forms at the family-run snack van, until someone shouts, "Hey, what's that?" And someone else shouts, "It's moving," and now everyone in the park is standing and pointing and gasping, and the tension ratchets up with each passing second: Hanging from the steel beams of a huge bridge that spans the Han, maybe a hundred yards away, is a long dollop of ... something ugly, a large fluttering tonsil of sorts.
It unfurls its body, back-flips cleanly from girder to girder, and jackknifes into the water with barely a splash. The crowds ahhs. A few snap photos with their cell phones. The creature glides just under the water's surface, along the bank. Nobody breathes. Then someone hits it with a beer can. Great. It leaps from the Han. It's full-grown and irate. It resembles a large tadpole with legs, like the result of sex between a rhinoceros and a school bus.
The other image comes in the end -- actually, it's the last shot (but it gives nothing away). The family who runs that snack van is sharing a meal. They've been through a lot. Summer's gone and winter's arrived. The camera pulls back until their tiny home is now a tiny island, the warm yellow glow of the light in the window, a swirl of snow gusting across the ground, and nobody else in sight.
Godzilla never had ennui.
But then The Host is the last thing you expect: a monster movie with a soul, a creature feature that uses the creature to get at something unexpected -- a snapshot of generations struggling to pull together. It starts with a familiar B-movie set-up, though, one with pointed political purpose: An American scientist orders his Korean assistant to pour 200 gallons of formaldehyde down the drain. The underling protests. But the scientist cuts him off: "I am not used to repeating myself!" Ah, the folly of man!
Will they never stop meddling with nature!?!
Cut to six years later, and we meet the Park family. Grandpa is a timid provider, weak in the knees, quick to bow to anyone in a uniform. His children are adult failures: There's the college graduate who can't get a job and dreams of his Molotov cocktail pro-democracy riot days (he may get a chance to re-live those); there's the professional archer (always handy in a monster movie) who always chokes, and there's the oldest, with a bad dye job, forever falling asleep when you need him. No one gets along. The one family member who isn't a mess is the grandchild, Hyun-seo (play by an exquisite young actress named Ah Sung Ko). But when monster meets matriarch, to the grief of the family, Hyun-seo is captured. The Parks mount a rescue attempt. Or rather, they try.
From here, like many a South Korean film, The Host spreads out in as many directions as that monster's jaw -- which unfolds like a malevolent flower. But the emotions are real and the focus is squarely on the characters. The film sags in its midsection, but that's out of ambition and willingness to chase an idea. The government overreacts and falls back into old authoritarian habits. Unlike old monster movies, in the new ones, like this one, the authorities are not your first choice when disaster strikes. The Parks wind up facing a bureaucracy as brutal as the beast. The military scapegoats. The visiting authorities (that's us, the U.S.) stonewall. If Godzilla was born of a nuclear blast, here is a monster born of new anxieties, and of course, we get the scary creature we deserve.

Movie Review: The Host, A Big Monster Movie With A Big Heart

  Feb. 21, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- 
 This South Korean monster movie swept the nation and now is on the brink of being released in North America. Since its release last year, The Host has been praised by critics at the Cannes Film Festival and has made legions of die-hard fans.The Host is inspired by the real story of illegal chemical dumping in the Han River, the river that runs right through Seoul. The fear that the toxins in the water would have dangerous effects on the public prompted the writers to concoct this tale.
 In the film, the chemicals mutate the marine life of the river and consequently, a large fish-like monster arises from the deep. But this is not the typical 'monster runs amok in a large metropolis' film; at its core there's a family drama with some laughs and an environmental message.The Park family, proprietors of a small riverside restaurant/convenience store, who bicker amongst themselves constantly, are bound together tightly when the young Hyun Seo, daughter of Gang Du, is captured by the monster and dragged to its underwater lair. They beg the military and the police to help them search for the missing child, but they are met with apathy and are dismissed. So, against all odds, the family break the security cordon around the area to search for her themselves.
 Director Joon-ho Bong has made a decent drama that doesn't get too sappy and at the same time a decent monster movie that doesn't go over the top with cheesy effects and dialog. Instead of making the movie dead serious, it has elements of comedy which make it much more appealing and interesting to watch. The monster plays a large role, but the family rallying together takes the bulk of the film. We get to see the monster relatively early on in the film and the special effects don't disappoint.The cast is made up of some veteran actors from Korean cinema and television: Kang So Song plays the lazy but good-hearted Gang Du; Ah-Sung Ko plays the cheerful, Hyun Seo; Hie-Bong Byeon plays the crotchety old grandpa, Hie-bong; Du-na Bae plays the athletic sister of Gang Du, Nam Joo; Hae-il Park plays the dyspeptic activist, Nam Il. 
 There is a small cameo from character actor Paul Lazar (of Mickey Blue Eyes, and the remake of The Manchurian Candidate), who plays a HAZMAT doctor who wants to help the Park family. He provides a ray of sunshine from the American involvement in the catastrophe. Unlike his counterparts, he shows real concern for the Park family and wishes he could help.The film is decent entertainment during its two-hour run time. It doesn't push any boundaries or break any new ground but it works well inside the genre. It has cheesy moments, heartfelt moments, and there are a few good laughs, so check it out when it's released on March 9, 2007.
 Watch the trailer.

  Jul. 27, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- In the best tradition of monster movies, Korean flick The Host is both a frightening tale of very bad things that go bump in the night and a political film. From the grand-daddy of them all, King Kong, which took on colonialism, to the monster that ate Tokyo, Godzilla and it.s anti-nuclear warning, the monster-political genre has been a rich lode to mine for 
The Host, directed by Bong-Joon Ho, takes monster film stereotypes and partly upends them in favour of a enviro-political genre film, retaining the monster of course. Apparently inspired by actual events in a U.S. military base in South Korea, the film begins with a tyrannical scientist ordering his assistant to pour every last bottle of formaldehyde and other unspecified poisons down the drain pipe, which connects conveniently enough to the nearby Han river. 
Mucho bad chemicals later, and a few years hence, a fisherman lands a hefty catch. This one does not get away, rather, it is the fisherman that is the submarine monster.s lunch. Soon after, we get to the monster.s rise from the depths - it.s got a slightly goofy air to it, and is shaped somewhat like a cross between a velociraptor from Jurassic Park and a trout, or is that an aquatic lizard gone bad? There are significant periods of time with aqua-Zilla lurking underwater, as a family struggles to hunt down it.s hiding place in the sewers of the 
The parallel, political theme of the film starts up soon after the appearance of the monster, when the witnesses are taken away to an .undisclosed location. while scientists run a battery of tests on them, and politicians rack their brains for a plausible explanation. The American influence is palpable, as is the sense of a post-9/11 vibe. he framing of the fight against the monster in the context of one family.s personal struggle gives the film greater depth than making it a traditional hero-driven quest or a band of misfits and fallen angels against the evil dark lord kind of story. No, that was the Harry Potter review. 
Anyway, the monster continues to appear when you least expect it, inducing quite a few shocking (and not schlocky) moments. The family is separated, and lose one member at the monster.s hands. As they draw closer to the lizard.s lair, we learn that the US Military is planning a scorched-earth solution to the problem, using Agent Orange-style chemicals to blast the baddie to Axis of Evil territory, where it doubtless came from, as no good doctor would ever do such a horrific thing. The original bad doc being the commanding officer of the US science corps makes this more believable, 
The rampaging mutant is barely slowed by the chemical attack, and it takes the combined efforts of the decimated family to stop him. The action narrows its focus to their struggle, as we recognize that other dangers might like beneath the river.s surface, and wonder what potent combination might be getting brewed as a combination of the earlier and the more recent chemical 
Fortunately, we.ll find out soon enough. The Korean film industry is not immune to sequel-itis and            a follow-on to The Host has been announced. Perhaps this time, the monster will take on Chinese overtones and cause a bird flu >

Monster hit in the making; Buzz is building for filmmaker Bong Joon-ho's The Host. The horror flick, which has won rave reviews and an armload of awards, opens across Canada tomorrow
The Globe and Mail (Canada)

 Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho arrived at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival last September with a monster hit. 
 The buzz for his new movie, The Host - a singular cinematic cross between a 1950s-style creature horror flick and a serio-comic family melodrama - began last May at the Cannes Film Festival; when the film opened a couple of months later in South Korea, it quickly became the country's highest-grossing film of all time. 
The Host now seems poised to become an unlikely international hit. Since its limited release (71 screens) in the United States a few weeks ago, it has garnered rave reviews and pulled in solid box-office numbers - modest compared with the $25-million (U.S.) raked in by TMNT (the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles flick) last weekend but certain to grow as The Host is unleashed on more North America screens over the next few weeks. 
 It opens in Canada tomorrow. 
 If enthusiasm for The Host on this continent is still limited to film critics and genre aficionados, it's a different story in Asia. Last week, The Host picked up major awards (best picture, actor, cinematographer and visual effects) at the inaugural Asian Film Awards in Hong Kong. 
 This month, The Host became the first South Korean film to top the weekend box office in China, where it is entitled The Han River Ghost. 
 The film's Chinese title gets the name of the river correct - but the creature that dwells there is no ghost. It's an enormous, crafty and surprisingly agile fish-like monster that wreaks havoc on the banks on the Han, quickly transforming the city into a paranoid police state. 
 Set in modern-day Seoul, The Host begins with a darkly humorous scene in which a U.S. scientist commands his helper to dump toxic chemicals down the drain - inspired by an actual incident that happened in the 1980s. "A toxic chemical was released into the Han River and people found fish with curved backs - some people even said the fish had legs," Bong explained in an interview during TIFF. 
 Bong, who understands English but spoke through an interpreter, worked with designer Jang Hee-chul to conceptualize not only the look but also the movement of the large mutant creature. "I suggested to Mr. Jang that the creature should have a Korean feel, it should look different that Western fantasy creatures so it would work well with Korean actors," he said. "We talked about how it should run fast on land when it attacks people and how it should do back flips off the bridge." 
 Tall and gregarious, Bong - whose previous films include Memories of Murder and Barking Dogs Never Bite - is a cinephile who knows his Peckinpah as well as his Kurosawa. Nods to film lore are evident throughout The Host, but the characters feel fresh and original - perhaps because his "heroes" are a family of unremarkable, unreliable talents trying to rescue their daughter/niece from the creature's lair. 
 "In genre films, the main characters are usually genius scientists or soldiers, but I don't like that convention," Bong said. "The family fighting the monster are all losers so they bumble, which gives us the comedy, and they are powerless, which gives us the tragedy." 
 Despite its unusual story, Bong doesn't think The Host has too many uniquely South Korean sensibilities. "The film shows some Korean paranoia about the government not protecting the lower classes or more helpless people in society," he explained, adding with a laugh, "And since [The Host] will be released in many foreign countries, I think the reception to the film will determine each country's opinion of its social welfare."

To put across the idea for his new movie, 'Memories of Murder' director Bong Joon-Ho stuck a cut-out of the Loch Ness monster on a picture of Seoul's Han river and showed it to his producer. Perhaps not the most auspicious of beginnings, but the resulting monster flick is now South Korea's all-time box-office champ, having been seen by 13 million of the country's 48 million inhabitants. In many ways, it's actually a very traditional creature feature, where careless pollution by the US military spawns a huge fleet-footed amphibian thingummy that appears on the riverbank to munch on fistfuls of passers-by before carrying the survivors to its hidden lair to snack on later. Constructed around surprisingly graceful digital effects (courtesy of San Francisco outfit, The Orphanage), this self-evident crowdpleaser skilfully strings together hair-raising scares, jet-black comedy and plucky heroism as an ordinary dysfunctional family set aside their differences to try to rescue their daughter from the beastie's clutches.
Although chomp 'n' chase is pretty much an international language, it's still a very Korean monster movie, in the way that Bong's previous masterly 'Memories of Murder' was an essentially Korean police procedural. The characters' emotional volatility is almost a given of course, but 'The Host' also moves beyond the usual genre formula, since it's rooted in burning indignation that the working-class folks at the centre of events are simply being ignored by high-handed authorities in thrall to the Americans - significant issues in a nation where democracy has only relatively recently taken root. All of which makes it the thinking person's giant mutant tadpole pic, and just how many of those have you seen lately?

                 May 23, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- Written by Jámon Y. Huevos
                  
Korean director BONG Joon-ho has created the most memorable "monster" movie in decades with his beautiful film The Host. Taking place in present day South Korea, The Host is about three generations of a family dealing with the disappearance of their youngest member, Hyun-seo. When an extremely large catfish-looking, monkey-climbing, human-consuming, chemically-created monster comes out of the river to wreak havoc on the locals, it's up to Hyun-seo's father, aunt, uncle, and grandfather to ignore their idiotic government and rescue her before she loses her life to a gruesome digestive process.
                  
There is so much to praise about The Host, but the most astounding accomplishment is its ability to walk the thin line between humor and pathos. BONG Joon-ho somehow finds a way to get the audience to laugh while a family mourns and to feel like crying while government clowns make a mockery of dealing with an emergency. This is done by paying attention to depth of character in the way that only Jaws has accomplished previously. You want the family to achieve its goals; you want the government to be knocked down; you want the host to find peace in a society it neither created nor necessarily wants to be forced to live in.
                  
There is a long-standing theory that to show the monster is to kill the effect. When examining Aliens, we can agree that this theory is not always  it is not necessarily what the monster looks like, it is how it is utilized. The monster in The Host is especially frightening because it invariably shows up in broad daylight, in full view, and moving fast, fast, fast. There will be complainers about the realism of the CGI in spots. To this, I say, deal with it. The audience is told in the first thirty seconds that the real monster here is governments that wish to clean up what they have decided is dirty in this world. And, believe me, those monsters couldn't be more lifelike. If you cannot take a jab about American warmongering, then this film is not for you; the gloves are off here, and the United States (and, to a lesser degree, the South Korean government) takes a brutal, funny beating in every other scene.
                  
The Host is the end result of pitch-perfect directing, acting, writing, cinematography, special effects, and two pinches of luck and charm. It will make you laugh while it frightens you. The Host reaches the greatest heights of filmmaking and is a gift to those of us who believe movies can not only be entertaining, but also stand as great art.This writer is a member of            The Masked Movie Snobs, a collective that fights a never-ending battle against bad entertainment.

 Director: Bong Joon-ho
 Category: IIA (Korean)
 The  opening of The Host  speaks volumes.  The thriller begins  in a gloomy  laboratory - possibly  intended to be one of South Korea's many  US military establishments - with an American commander  ordering an aide to "just dump" formaldehyde into the sewers. The startled Korean  warns that these  lead directly to the Han River that runs through Seoul. "The Han River is broad, so let's be broad-minded", says the American. "That's an order, anyway."
 It's an  exchange that is  drenched with symbolism.  It  backgrounds the origins of the monster that  will become central to the  film, and lays bare director Bong Joon-ho's intention of making a political film.   The monster may terrorise Seoul, but the root of the trouble lies with the presence in the country of  US military personnel,  who are beyond the local jurisdiction.
 Not that The Host is merely anti-US propaganda dressed up in the flimsy shell of a thriller.  The mayhem - blood, gore and skeletal remains - are  an assault  on the senses. And there are moments of hilarity, with some of South Korea's best comedians among the cast  (Song Kang-ho delivers a deadpan performance as the feeble father Gang-du that's as funny as  his turn in Foul King).
 What makes The Host remarkable is how Bong allows the political allegories to run as much amok as the monster.  It's no wonder The Host has become the biggest Korean movie ever.  While entertaining as a thriller and a comedy, it also presents  a distillation of the country's turbulent recent history into its two-hour storyline.
 With the monster a thinly veiled symbol of the US,  the blundering  government officials and helpless citizens reflect a sense of  eclipsed manhood  and nationhood. The way Gang-du's teenage daughter Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung)  is snatched by the monster  suggests  the nature of relations between  American soldiers and local women.   And street demonstrations  evoke the  anti-establishment struggles  within South Korea since the 1970s.
 The multiple layers Bong constructs  gel well. The Host is a solid achievement that works on both sensational and cerebral levels - and serves as one of the pinnacles of South Korean filmmaking.
 The Host opens on September 14

  Feb. 24, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- 
Gang-du (SONG Kang-hu) works at a food market on the banks of the Han River in Seoul, South Korea. While nodding off on the job, he is awakened by his daughter, Hyun-seo (KO A-sung), who is mad with him for missing the PTA meeting at her school. As Gang-du walks out to the riverbank with a delivery, he notices that a large crowd of people from the beach area are taking pictures of something hanging from the Han River Bridge. This beach area is usually the laid back place to hang out turns suddenly to mayhem, when a terrifying Loch Ness looking creature climbs up onto the riverbank and begins to crush, snatch, and eat people. Gang-du and his daughter run for their lives, but suddenly the creature grabs Hyun-seo and disappears back into the river. The South Korean government announces that the monstous thing is the Host of an unidentified virus.

It all started years earlier from the opening scenes of the movie, when a scientist instructs his assistant to toss out chemical waste materials down the drain, which will eventually settle in the Han River.

As the Seoul city police, South Korean government scientist, and the U.S. military are detaining its residents who could be contaminated. The government and military decide to use its secret weapon - Agent Yellow gas - to kill the creature. Having feared the worst that his daughter is dead, Gang-hu receives a phone (cell) call from his daughter who is scared, but alive. It seems that she has managed to escape from the monster and hide in the Han Bridge tunnels where she meets a little boy who has become a victim. Gang-du soon makes his plans with his brother, his father, and his sister to infiltrate the forbidden zone near the Han River to rescue his daughter from the horrifying Host. Well, I'm not going to be a spoiler on this review, but I can tell you everything does not end up completely happy.

The director/writer BONG Joon-ho's film suggest that its context is schizophrentic, because the scenes are very dramatic and entertaining with a twist of comedy, but an audience will respond more to the eerie moods it projects. The talk of the 2006 Cannes International Film Festival was that he utilizes state-of-art special effects to tell his story that is equally proportioned as a creature feature thriller, comedy, and a poignant human drama. In my opinion this one of the best monster flix made lately. Spielberg move over.

Last year saw the UK release of Gojira (Godzilla) in its original 1954 Japanese cut, revealing a subtextual depth and philosophical melancholy absent from the bastardised US version of this seminal creature-feature. The ghost of Gojira hangs heavy over The Host , in which South Korean wunderkind Bong Joon-ho unleashes a rampaging monster from the polluted waters of the River Han in the capital, Seoul.
Like its thematic predecessor, The Host was inspired by a real-life news story - the case of Albert McFarland, a US forces mortuary attendant in Korea, who was reported to have dumped toxic waste down a drain leading to the Han in July 2000. In Bong's typically off-kilter nightmare, a mutant is duly spawned which attacks local people, providing much eye-popping, monster-munching fun, alongside the usual baffling blend of tragicomic human interest.
According to Bong, the inspiration for The Host ranged from a childhood fascination with the Loch Ness monster to an admiration for M Night Shyamalan's Signs, an alien invasion thriller. 'My film is a kidnap movie,' says Bong, 'about a family trying to get their daughter back from a kidnapper who happens to be a monster.'
This polymorphous approach to the genre is typical of a director who constantly leaves his audience uncertain whether to laugh, cry or scream - more often than not, the only answer is to do all three. This dual-disc DVD comes with umpteen scenes that were deleted from the final cut, storyboard footage, special-effects breakdowns and behind-the-scenes featurettes in which the cast and crew remember the stinking horrors of filming in the Han sewer system. Bong is gung-ho throughout, happy to get his hands dirty - and his shins bloody - as he throws himself into the production. Along with the weirdly wonderful Memories of Murder , this confirms Bong as a bona fide movie-making maestro.

More than a monster in deep with The Host

The Host, a blockbusting South Korean monster movie featuring a giant killer amphibian with 10 legs and a face that might freak Mike Tyson, begins on a note of such bravura nuttiness you may be left wondering how the movie will ever recover
The amazing thing is that it does. Not fully, but close enough.
After we've learned that an autocratic American scientist (Scott Wilson) has ordered a couple of hundred gallons of formaldehyde dumped into Seoul's Han River (itself a long-standing source of environmental anxiety), a couple of fisherman pull a wee creature from the drink, get nipped, and toss it back in.
Cut to a brilliantly sunny day on the banks of the Han: kites are flying, children are romping, and workers enjoying lunch purchased from the ubiquitous snack stands.
Then somebody notices something odd under a bridge: a huge serpentine creature dangling like a large string of snot, which promptly slips into the water with the precision of an Olympic diver. When it makes its underwater approach to the shore where people are watching in idiot disbelief, somebody gets the bright idea to toss a beer can at the thing. This is how hell breaks loose.
In the ensuing rampage, the creature leaps from the water and clumsily -- almost drunkenly -- proceeds to eat everything it can suck up in its path. Loping along like a Ray Harryhausen-animated stop-action effect on downers, it chows down on the lunchtime crowd before snatching up schoolgirl Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung) with a deftly swiped tail before slipping back into the drink.
Needless to say, it is highly unusual for a creature in a creature feature to be so amply displayed with such unceremonious dispatch. No slow reveal here. Just in with the beer can and out with the monster. And almost as quickly as you can re-hinge your jaw, it's gone.
It's enough to leave you wondering whether what you've just seen is actually what this audaciously unconventional monster movie -- a blend of Godzilla, Scooby-Doo and George Romero's The Crazies -- considers the real monster. It isn't.
The youngest member of the profoundly dysfunctional and largely intellectually challenged Park family, young Hyuen-seo is soon the object of a stumbling but determined pursuit by her family: her dim-bulb but loving dad Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), her bickering aunt (Bae Du-na) and uncle (Park Hae-il), and long-suffering grandfather (Byeon Hie-bong).
While initially appearing as likely to succeed as the U.S. military in Iraq, the Parks do eventually transcend their considerable internal issues in an alternately comic and strangely heartfelt demonstration of family solidarity.
Then again, as Bong Joon-ho movie is so pumped to demonstrate, the Parks are all the Parks have got. As the monster triggers a national panic and as the American-backed officials begin rounding people up and stoking the fear factor to truly Homeland Security-esque proportions, The Host has shifted the focus of its horror almost entirely. Next to the rapidly collapsing social structure, the casual mistreatment of citizens and the obvious level of environmental neglect at work, the monster itself is, if not benign, at least comparatively harmless. If, that is, you can call a rampaging, huge, 10-legged carnivorous amphibian harmless.
Bravely shifting tones from the horrific to the slapstick and back again, Bong Joon-ho has made a movie that's comprised almost equally of family sitcom, political indictment, high-urban paranoia and maximum-geek, monster-movie delight.
The Host really should be seen before it gets remade for North American consumption.

Jun. 14--DVD : "The Host Director : Bong Joon-ho Starring : Song Kang-ho, Byeon Hie-bong, Ko Ah-sung Running time : 119 minutes Rated R List price : $9.99
The movie (A-): Engaging the mind as well as jolting the nervous system, the best science fiction keeps your rapt attention while implanting some manner of social or political comment.
To wit, "The Host," by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, in which a monster, slithering out of the river into which the American military had dumped toxic chemicals a few years past, terrorizes a city, hungrily devouring those unlucky to be in its path.
But, this movie has much more on its mind than environmental wrist-slapping.
Quicker than you can say "9/11," the government swings into action -- not to kill the creature, which develops an insatiable appetite for, um, Korean food, but using the attacks as an excuse to quarantine and impose martial law on the populace under the pretext that the monster is a host carrying a dangerous virus. Even though there is no such bug.
It's up to a decidedly unheroic -- in fact, close to idiotic -- family to track it through the city sewers, to rescue the child it's keeping as part of its food supply.
The lesson of Bong's droll, surprisingly funny thriller is that some distance -- actual and emotional -- is needed to appreciate the full extent of the assault on our civil liberties by those who are supposed to be protecting us from the evildoers; how easily fear, with the media's eager cooperation, can sell such constraints; and how surprisingly simple it is to divert the public's attention from a real threat to a fictional one.
Just substitute "War on Terror," "Osama," "Guantanamo," "Extraordinary Rendition" or "WMDs" for "Host" and you'll get the idea.
For the "I don't go to the movies to think" crowd, "The Host" more than gets the job done as a creature feature loaded with plenty of "ick" moments. One favorite: A crowd of people runs into a trailer to escape the thing, but it turns out it fits neatly into the box. Too bad the back door's locked!
Extras (D): "The Host" is available in any number of versions on import discs. The one I bought, on HKFlix.com, was Chinese (with English subtitles among the options) and had no extras. Others have plenty.
Overall (A-): No point in waiting around for any local venue to take a chance on something this cool when you can buy the disc for about the price of one ticket and turn your friends on to boot. "The Host" easily could be trimmed by 10 or 15 minutes, but that's my only quibble with this smart and scary little find.

Film review: `The Host' an intense, wickedly funny update of classic Asian monster flicks

An update of the classic Asian monster movies of yore, "The Host" boasts a wicked sense of humor and vastly improved special effects. (Not once do you see a zipper up the back of a rubber suit.)
Korean writer-director Bong Joon-Ho has crafted a film that just kicks butt from start to finish, even though its anti-American sentiment feels a bit half-baked. He is clearly well-acquainted with the genre, though, and is confident enough in his abilities to make it his own.
Reminiscent of another recent smart, sly horror movie, 2004's "Shaun of the Dead," "The Host" begins with a dry, frequently absurd comic sensibility, but steadily grows darker, more intense and truly thrilling.
Pollution in Seoul's Han River (caused by a thoughtless American scientist, naturally) gives birth to a freakishly large, angry, mutant fish that's a marvel to behold the product of a collaboration between the visual effects specialists at Weta Workshop (the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy) and The Orphanage ("Sin City").
The creature is at once familiar and unlike anything you've seen before: It swings gracefully from bridges, leaps from the water to lash people with its long tail, and frequently just hops up on shore and runs after its prey. And the first time we see it, it thunders onto the scene no oppressively melodramatic music to accompany its arrival, which makes it even more powerful. The monster knows how to make an entrance (and so does Bong.)
Oh, did we mention? The fish has feet. And several buggy eyes that sprout all over its scaly head and a mouth that opens like a tulip to suck people in and either a) spit them back out or b) devour them to their bones. Very clever and cool.
One of the victims it picks up and scampers off with is teenage schoolgirl Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung), which forces her slacker dad, Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), and the rest of her dysfunctional family to spring into action to rescue her.
Hyun-seo's aunt, Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na), is a competitive archer with a propensity for choking at the most crucial moments (though her skills do come in handy as the film progresses). Her uncle, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), is the family's comparative success story: He actually has a college degree, though he has no job. And family patriarch Heui-bong (Byeon Heui-bong) runs a longtime food stand on the banks of the river, where Gang-du works but mostly snoozes.
At first they assume Hyun-seo is dead, along with countless others who fell in the path of the monster's rampage; rather than console each other, they collapse in a pile of kicking and slapping and laying blame for her fate. But then they receive a scratchy cell phone call from the sewer and realize she's still alive and that they must save her, even though they have absolutely no clue what they're doing.
They're a Korean version of the "Little Miss Sunshine" clan, complete with a minivan (which they've stolen), which would seem annoyingly trite if it weren't so curiously charming in itself. They're so well developed, you really grow to care about these people.
Meanwhile, a hysteria is spreading across the region, as it seems anyone who came into contact with the monster is carrying a deadly virus (hence the title). The government borrows a U.S. military device for cleansing the area: the very mysterious Agent Yellow, which causes nothing but paranoia and panic. Basically, everything American in the film causes paranoia and panic, a political concept Bong broaches but never truly fleshes out.
But the director does know how to create a mood that tingles with suspense; he grabs you and doesn't let go, and he doesn't go for the easy ending. And that's anti-American too, in the best possible way.
"The Host," a Magnolia Pictures release, is rated R for creature violence and language. Running time: 119 minutes. Three stars out of four.
Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions:
G General audiences. All ages admitted.
PG Parental guidance suggested. Some material may not be suitable for children.
PG-13 Special parental guidance strongly suggested for children under 13. Some material may be inappropriate for young children.

Director: Bong Joon-ho With: Song Kang-ho, Byeon Hie-bong, Park Hae-il, Bae Du-na, Ko Ah-sung 119 mins, cert 15
Korean director Bong Joon-ho's uproarious new film about a gigantic sea monster is beautifully and even subtly made. Maybe even a bit too beautifully and subtly. Despite the extraordinary CGI scenes of a fully fledged monster attacking the big city, harking back to the glory days of Godzilla and Kong, I found something oddly unscary about the creature itself. And the film, though intriguing, doesn't quite have the raw, crazy showmanship of an old-fashioned monster movie. The creature, as it emerges from the Han river to pulverise the citizens of Seoul in South Korea, is awe-inspiring, exotic, even a touch humorous. But not terrifying like, say, Ridley Scott's Alien.
However, Bong's movie is not merely about spectacle: there is a dash of
anti-American satire in the fact that the monster was caused by pollution from a US military base, whose top brass insist on a heavy-handed imposition of "quarantine" as the panic spreads. Could it be that the Americans, accustomed to treating South Korea
as a buffer zone against Kim Jong-il's rogue state to the north, are the real aliens, the real monsters?
Satire is subservient, though, to
the drama of a family changed forever by the monster's appearance. Song
Kang-ho, who played the heavy-set cop in the director's much-admired 2003 thriller Memories of Murder, here plays a pathetic layabout who must redeem himself when the monster grabs his young daughter from the riverbank and swims off with her. The Ballardian nightmare of the anarchic monster playing havoc with the cool, rational technopolis is always riveting.

  (Korean, English dialogue)
  
  On almost every level, there's never quite been a monster movie like "The Host." Egregiously subverting its own genre while still delivering shocks at a pure genre level, and marbled with straight-faced character humor that constantly throws the viewer off balance, this much-hyped big-budgeter about a huge mutant tadpole that emerges from Seoul's Han River is a bold gamble that looks headed to instant cult status. Broader biz, especially beyond East Asia, will depend heavily on reaction to its world preem in Directors Fortnight, and some re-editing would better equip it for specialty distribution in the West.
  Film is set for a wide, late-July release in South Korea, followed by an early September rollout in Japan, which provided almost half of the reported $10 million coin (huge in local terms). Helmer Bong Joon-ho has not ruled out some tweaking in the meantime. Reaction at its gala midnight screening on May 21, heavily populated by Asiaphiles, was a mixture of admiration and discombobulation.
  Beyond all the fancy visual effects --- way above the rocky level of recent Asian fantasies like "The Myth" and "The Promise" --- the tone of the pic falls somewhere between the social parable of Bong's "Barking Dogs Never Bite" and the character-driven, offbeat drama of his "Memories of Murder."
  Pic, which is not even in widescreen, will be best appreciated by auds who just go with the quirky flow rather than expect regulated, U.S.-style thrills.  
  Prologue, set six years ago at the U.S. Army Base in Yonsan, Seoul, has a South Korean flunky ordered by his Yank boss (NEED NAME) to empty gallons of aging formaldehyde into the sink --- and therefore straight into the Han River . Clearly ludicrous English-language scene (which would benefit from revoicing) signals Bong's lack of interest in making a science-heavy blockbuster --- there's little emphasis on the usual government-military paraphernalia of such movies. Cut to October '06 and locals are enjoying a day out on the banks of the river. Among them are convenience stall owner Park Heui-bong (Byeon Heui-bong), his idle doofus son, Gang-du (Song Gang-ho, the cop in "Murder"), and the latter's daughter, young high-schooler Hyeon-seo (Ko A-sung).
  When something is spotted hanging beneath one of the bridges and then sliding into the river, the locals pelt it with cans and snacks .
  First appearance of the monster is aces, catching the viewer off guard after a slow build-up. Combo of visceral energy and offbeat humor, plus Lee Byeong-woo's pounding drum music, is impressive, and as the creature finally scoops up Hyeon-su with its tail and swims off, the stage is set.
   Script's political content is more occasional barb than fully developed subtext. Bong maintains the focus on the Park family, with Gang-du lumbering through the drama with assists from onetime student revolutionary Nam-il and expert archer Nam-ju.  Problematic central section could do with 15 minutes of tightening. Final half-hour, however, is aces, as all threads connect, with no simple heroes and a kind of sad, messy triumph, plus barbed coda.
  Perfs are more than fine with especial kudos to Ko as the plucky Hyeon-seo, local star Song as the working-class slob, and Bae Du-na (lead in "Dogs"), as the sportswoman.
  Visual f/x, supervised by Kevin Rafferty ("Star Wars: Episode I --- The Phantom Menace") and largely done by San Francisco-based the Orphanage, are a slick meld of CGI and animation, while always reminding the audience that, at the end of the day, the creature is only a movie monster.

  Mar. 9, 2007 (Gapers Block delivered by Newstex) -- 
Good day, all.
Well, the only films I won't be reviewing this week are the two that I missed screenings of due to my travel schedule. Both happen to be opening at the Music Box Theatre, and both are reported to be quite good. Actually, I've seen the 1964 masterpiece Becket, but it's been a number of years, and this is a brand spanking new 35mm print of this 12-time Academy Award nominee, so I'm going to refresh my memory. If you've ever wanted to see two of the world's greatest actors/friends/carousers (Peter O'Toole and Richard Burton), look no further. The other film is Bamako, apparently a major slap in the face for the world financial system as it relates to the destruction of Africa. Cheery, but I'm hearing many good things about it. And now, on to the film's I've seen, including seven capsule reviews (located at the end of this column) of movies playing as part of the Gene Siskel Film Center's European Union Film Festival. There is a lot worth checking out during this month-long preview of the greatest films from across the Atlantic.
300
Two films I've been desperate to tell you about since last year are finally being released this week. The first I saw in December at Butt Numb-a-Thon 8 in Austin. Director Zack Snyder (who made the well-done Dawn of the Dead remake) was on hand after the screening and told us the film still needed some minor tweaking (mostly color correction and other things most civilians wouldn't even see as unfinished). When I saw 300 more recently, I didn't notice any real difference, but it was a good opportunity for me to judge whether the stunning visuals I remembered so clearly were simply hiding a run-of-the-mill sword-and-sandals tale, or if there was really some substance to this graphic and sensual tale of a small group of Spartan warriors fighting off the Persian masses who attempted to enslave the world one nation at a time. Glory be, this movie kicked even more shapes and sizes of ass on my second go-round, setting the bar ridiculously high for genre films in 2007.
First off, there's a great deal of yelling in 300. In fact, more than 50 percent of the dialogue is uttered at a raised volume (you probably gleaned that from the trailers). I thought this would bother me more than it did, but it actually heightened my overall interest in the goings on. Based on the Frank (Sin City) Miller graphic novel (which I'm totally unfamiliar with), the film tells the bloody and savage tale of 300 men against more than 100,000 at the battle of Thermopylae. Why did Sparta only send 300 men? Actually, Sparta didn't. The corrupt Spartan government (exemplified by Dominic West) refused to send an army to challenge the Persian hordes. So King Leonidas (Gerard Butler of Phantom of the Opera and Tomb Raider 2 fame) defied the city elders and soothsayers by hand picking 300 "bodyguards" to accompany him on a long walk. Clever fellow, that Leonidas. What follows is almost solid sweaty, gory, clever and, above all, brutal battles.
By using some choice digital effects, director Snyder is not content to allow his sword and spear battles to look like those before. In almost every instance, you see swords go into bare chests. These guys aren't using bulky clothes and tricky camera angles to simulate weapon penetration. This is meant to look about as real as anything I've seen on screen, which is ironic since so little else about the film is meant to look like it even takes place in this world. Much like the textures and colors from a graphic novel, the skies and landscapes of 300 appear more like idealized planetscapes of some far off world. Many of the battle sequences are done in slow motion, so you don't miss a single lost limb or drop of blood. Even skin tones seem art directed by a painter. The visual backgrounds don't take away from the story. If anything, they add an archetypal feel to everything in this movie. It takes your breath away and absolutely demands that you see the film more than once, just to admire the craftsmanship.
For all its savagery, 300 also has its moments of sensuality. Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo, is a stone-cold honey played by Lena Headey (known more for her work in lighter fare on film; she's also set to play the title role on "The Sarah Connor Chronicles" TV series). While Leonidas is gone, Gorgo must do what she can to protect Sparta from its own politicians. Heady's performance is fierce and sexy, and I would very much like her to tie me down and punish me for whatever. One of the stranger characters is the towering Persian king himself, Xerxes (Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro, who occasionally shows up on "Lost" as Paulo), who believes he is a god and wears as much jewelry as any god I've ever seen. It's a bizarre but unforgettable performance.
It's safe to say that 300 is unlike anything you've ever seen before, with portions based soundly in reality and other sections seemingly ripped right out of some great lost fantasy novel. It exists in its own universe and will leave you utterly in awe of the story it tells. Snyder's command of the visuals (with more than a little help from Miller's source material, undoubtedly) shows a confidence I would not have expected and leaves me hopeful that he is the right man for the job to bring Alan Moore's Watchmen graphic novel to the screen. This film is opening on IMAX screens this week as well; I'm drooling just thinking about it.
The Host
During last year's Chicago Film Festival in October, there were two showings of a movie that may single-handedly usher in a new kind of scary movie on our shores (assuming anybody goes to see it). At its core, South Korea's The Host is a monster movie, but the secret of why it succeeds only partially has to do with its hideously realized creature. In truth, The Host is a heartfelt and funny family drama disguised as a monster movie epic, and it is these distinctly human qualities that make the icky stuff so cool. Not to underplay the fantastic scares this film delivers, but it wouldn't mean as much to us if we didn't care so much about the people this mutant creature was terrorizing.
Director and co-writer Joon-ho Bong (who also directed the powerful serial killer procedural Memories of Murder) shows us he's not just comfortable in any genre; he's downright formidable. The film opens in classic monster movie fashion with an evil autopsy doctor ordering his underling to pour gallons of toxic formaldehyde down the drain and into the water supply somewhere near Seoul, South Korea. The hilarious twist here is that the doctor is American, and the setting for this event is a U.S. military base in South Korea. You can always count on the Americans to screw things up. But by making this distinction, Bong is leaving many elements of his film open to interpretation. The chemicals in the water result in the creation of a giant monster that looks like a mutated fish or lizard or something that can breathe underwater and on land. And while the director never explicitly says so, this monster could represent all sorts of things, the same way Godzilla was delivered unto the world as a warning about the harmful effects of atomic weapons. Is The Host's creature meant to represent America or the Iraq War or capitalism or tourists or corporate greed? Ultimately, it doesn't matter, but it's still fun to think about and it adds some socio-political weight to the film.
The real stars of the film are the three generations of the Park family, a fractured group living in Seoul who band together when the creature takes the youngest member of the family and stores her away for future eating. The first clue that The Host is unlike so many other monster movies is that the creature appears right at the beginning of the film, in broad daylight. Bong is not interested in hiding his creation, or parceling stolen looks until a big reveal near the end. Nope, he wants us to become overly familiar with his freakish being, every slimy scale, fin, tail and other unidentifiable appendages. If anything, we see less and less of the monster as the film goes on and as the family's story to find the little girl takes over. The suspense comes more from anticipating the creature's return. But when it attacks, it is quick and ferocious. Although the monster does eat humans, The Host is largely a bloodless affair, with a few choice exceptions.
Even when the monster is on screen, it's not always in the foreground. Often, large groups of people are running from it, and while the fleeing masses are in the foreground, you catch glimpses of the beast as it closes in on them from behind. The effect is awesome and terrifying. As easy as it would be to draw parallels between The Host and Japanese horror flicks like Godzilla, the comparisons don't quite hold up. First of all, there's no Raymond Burr. But more importantly, the emphasis on the dysfunctional family attempting to mend its differences and become closer makes this film more akin to Jaws or Signs or Poltergeist. And I don't draw these comparisons lightly; I firmly believe that The Host stands right there with some of the great monster offerings in recent years, and, yes, I cringe at the thought of a possible remake from Universal. But if any studio has a strong history with monster movies, it's that one. Let's hope they don't forget what makes this movie stand out from the pack. Don't clutter the remake with attractive teens or hunky heroes. The original has neither. A big part of what makes The Host so perfect is the anti-hero nature of all of the leads. This is one of those films you'll probably have to seek out, folks, but it will be well worth your effort. The film opens at the Landmark Century Center Cinema.
Starter for 10
While I'd anticipated this fairly lightweight British comedy to be an oh, so pithy and clever tale of a young man's intellectual and romantic awakening at university, much to my pleasant surprise I got an only slight pithy and usually charming celebration of knowledge in the early 1980s. Setting a film in the UK in the early '80s can only mean one thing: a kick-ass Brit pop soudtrack courtesy of The Cure, Tears for Fears (first album only), The Buzzcocks, The Smiths, Echo and the Bunnymen, The Psychedelic Furs and even Wham!, and those are just the ones I can remember. Even if you find Starter for 10 too trite for its own good, you're still going to want to buy the soundtrack.
In some ways, the movie is the one John Hughes would have made if he'd grown up in Britain. The emotions are pretty surface oriented, the outcome predictable, the "ugly" duckling isn't so ugly, and did I mention the kick-ass soundtrack? The plot centers on Brian (James McAvoy), a young man obsessed with filling his head with the type of learning that will earn him a spot on University Challenge (if you've ever seen the UK comedy series "The Young Ones," you should know what this show is). He heads off from his working-class town to university, and gets a spot on the team right around the time he falls head over heels for the prettiest girl at school (the WASP-y Alice Eve). He also meets a politically active Jewish girl named Rebecca (Rebecca Hall), and the two become fast friends. The fact that she's an exotic-looking, intellectually stimulating woman never even enters his pea brain, but I've seen enough John Hughes movies to know the thought of those two together has entered mine.
I could detail the emotional rollercoaster Brian puts himself through during the course of his first year of school, but what's important is that he learns not only to collect facts, but also to respect and analyze them as an adult. Shockingly enough, he also learns to lose his fascination for bright, shiny things as far as the women in his life go, and the film winds down to its inevitable but still sweet conclusion. McAvoy the actor is beginning to grow on me. He's been doing solid support work in films like The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe (he was Mr. Tumnus) and most recently opposite Forest Whitaker in Last King of Scotland, but this is his first real lead, and he grew on me like a happy fungus. Throw in a couple actors from last year's The History Boys, and you've got yourself a fairly commendable work. This isn't my strongest possible recommendation, but if you've got a couple of hours to kill and find yourself near Pipers Alley sometime in the next couple of weeks, you could do worse.
Gray Matters
I don't know the name Susan Kramer -- the writer-director of the new PG-13-rated metropolitan, coming-out-of-the-closet comedy Gray Matters -- but I know one thing about her: she loves New York. And she hasn't come up with a single original written or visual way of conveying her love. Someone in this movie actually utters the line "I love this city" as if no one in the history of the world or movies has thought or uttered that sentiment before. The fact that the character proclaims the line from the roof of the New Yorker building, well, that just about makes you wanna throw up, doesn't it?
I lived in New York for a couple years; I acknowledge the greatness of its citizens, its entertainment value and its potential for love affairs. But the New York I knew was not a personal playground for pseudo-intellectuals who do nothing but stay up all night, quoting obvious movie dialogue, and coming home to apartments as large as Grand Central Station. Perhaps the biggest insult to the Big Apple comes in the form of a woman named Gray (Heather Graham), who is just now, sometime in her early 30s, not only coming out of the closet as a lesbian, but also realizing she's gay at all. This awareness comes just as her brother/roommate Sam (Tom Cavanagh) meets a spectacularly perfect Charlie (Bridget Moynahan) on his first day out trying to meet a woman. After pulling an all-nighter date, he returns to the apartment he shares with Gray and announces he's getting married that weekend in Las Vegas. The night before the wedding, Gray and Charlie stay up very late drinking (a very awkward moment at a nightclub performance by Gloria Gaynor is the highlight of the evening) and end up making out for about five seconds. This singular event leads Gray to the uneasy realization that she might be a little bit gay, and maybe slightly in love with Charlie, who was too drunk to even remember the kiss.
Gray Matters is something of a slap in the face to all films about people "coming out," by treating Gray's predicament like it's something "wild" and "kooky" and "out there." They live in New York City; nobody cares that you're gay in NYC. Hello! Meanwhile, we get Graham running around like a third-rate Woody Allen neurotic and acting like she's the first attractive woman in her early 30s to have gay thoughts. The presence of Alan Cummings as a straight cab driver who has a little crush on Gray and ends up being her best friend after one drive around town together doesn't add an ounce of artistic or gay credibility to the proceedings. But the worst thing about Gray Matters is that it simply isn't funny or clever about any of its observations on gay or straight life. In case you non-New Yorkers aren't smart enough to figure it out, this movie blows.
European Union Film Festival
Flies on the Wall
In this interesting experiment from Denmark, director Ake Sandgren (the Dogme film Truly Human) attempts to apply a political thriller feel to what is essentially a story about a local political scandal. When the Liberal Party hires a documentary filmmaker (Trine Dyrholm) to profile the party and its most dynamic candidate (Lars Brygmann), they tell her she'll have total access to all aspects of the party's inner workings. She translates this to mean she can plant hidden cameras everywhere and even sometimes wear spy cameras on her person to capture private conversations. She inadvertently uncovers a massive corruption and money diversion scandal that could bring down the candidate and the party. Of course, her life becomes endangered when it's discovered she knows too much. A few things about Flies on the Wall don't quite hold water. First, why would such a corrupt government allow total access to anything they do? Maybe they think since she's working for them, they can kill whatever final film she edits together, but that isn't ever mentioned. Second, the filmmaker starts sleeping with her subject. I never bought this for a second. Third, much of the film is shown through the eye of the filmmaker's many cameras; it's as if we're watching her final film as she's compiling it. However, whenever a scene is required that her cameras could not have captured, director Sandgren simply cuts away to his own third-party vantage point. It's a slightly jolting experience that would have been more exciting if he were forced to stick with just her vantage point. Still, the film has plenty of suspense to keep us charged, and the performances are solid, even if the film doesn't quite add up. It plays on Friday, March 9 at 6:15pm, and Tuesday, March 13 at 7:45pm.
Manual of Love
Four stories of couples representing the four stages of love, from goofy young love to painful breakup, make up this award-winning offering from Italy. Each emotionally charged tale is worth watching, but some (especially the stalker-ish nature of the first story) are a little too out of touch with reality. Still, that shortcoming is more than made up for by the second story, an all-too-real account of troubled marriage (played by ex-spouses Margherita Buy and Sergio Rubini). I was also moved by the tale of a sorrowful doctor (Carlo Verdone) trying to pull his life together after his wife abandons him. The stories are slightly interconnected, but not in a overly trite manner. One story flows nicely into the next, and the performances are uniformly solid, even if the lessons learned are familiar. Director Giovanni Veronesi has crafted a warm and affectionate work that doesn't seek to shake the foundations of relationship films, but he still manages to find some fresh insight on the subject. The film plays Saturday, March 10 at 2:45pm.
Me and My Sister
If you put Isabelle Huppert in a movie, I'm there. And if you make her a cold-hearted, abrasive bitch, well, I don't have any choice but to fall in love with her. In this tasty bit from France, Huppert plays the city mouse Martine, who plays host to her country mouse sister Louise (the charming Catherine Frot), a beautician coming to Paris to meet with a publisher that might be interested in a book she's written. Martine finds Louise's cheeriness and upbeat personality an annoyance and an embarrassment, especially when mixing with her upper-crust friends. But the fact is, most people find Louise sweet and not nearly as unsophisticated as Martine believes she is. What Martine is really troubled by is how Louise's cheer seems to underscore the fact that Martine hates her life and her marriage to a womanizing husband (Francois Berleand). Huppert is at her seething best here. There's a scene during a dinner party in which she gets drunk and spouts off all sorts of terrible things about Louise in front of all the guests. It's a painful event to witness, and director Alexandra Leclere punctuates the event with the perfect amount of awkwardness. Far from the comic tripe that Hollywood would turn this subject matter into, Me and My Sister is among the darkest of dark comedies that still manages to pack in a fair amount of love for and between its characters. The film plays Sunday, March 11,  at 3pm, and Thursday, March 15 at 6pm.
Dead Long Enough
From Ireland comes one of the weaker entries at this year's festival, Dead Long Enough, which tells the story of two brothers: Harry, a celebrity played by The Queen's Michael Sheen, and Ben, a lawyer in a bad relationship made all the worse by his perpetual broken heart over his hometown sweetie (Angeline Ball) that he hasn't seen in 16 years. Although I'd read somewhere that Sheen's character is a rock star, I think he's the host of a popular television show about digging up ancient remains that shares the same title as this film. He's sort of the leather-clad, longhaired archaeological version of the Crocodile Hunter. Anyway, Harry decides the pair are going to fly back to their hometown as part of Ben's bachelor party, but his real intention is to make Ben forget this woman once and for all. It turns out the woman in question, Sinead, had a baby shortly after the brothers left town, but who's the father? Hmmm. There are more candidates than you might think. The last 30 minutes of Dead Long Enough feature a messy series of events that neatly tie up age-old conflicts and unresolved feelings as only a 90-minute movie can. The best thing about the film is the rousing soundtrack, which features a mix of traditional and rock music from Irish musicians. I suppose Sheen's presence (I'm fairly certain he shot this movie before The Queen) adds a bit of professionalism to the piece, but the whole production is childish and off-putting. The film plays Saturday, March 10 at 4:45pm, and Wednesday, March 14 at 8pm.
Into Great Silence
A lot of times when critics use words like "contemplative" or "meditative" to describe a particularly long or slow-moving film, what they really mean is "the movie was boring, but I still liked it." In the case of this nearly three-hour documentary from German director Philip Groning, I confess I found this look inside the usually secluded life of the Grand Chartreuse monastery in the French Alps absolutely serene and lovely, but at times it borders on contemplative and meditative. Much like the typically lengthy documentaries of Frederick Wiseman, Into Great Silence is more than a filmmaker pointing his camera at a subject. Using only the natural sound and light around him, Groning (with no additional crew) completely immerses himself in this largely silent and still world, in which the monks work and pray and hope that sometime before they die, God will reveal himself to them. We observe even the smallest aspects of their routines and rituals, including meal preparation, inducting new members into their order, laundry and, of course, praying. I'm sure during the course of watching this work, even the most dedicated audience member will be fighting off sleep at times (do not attempt to operate heavy equipment while watching this film), but the end result is a work of rare and compelling beauty. The film will screen Saturday, March 10 at 3pm, and opens at the Music Box Theatre later this spring.
The Iceberg
In one of the oddest and most weirdly entertaining films in a while, this feature from Belgium opens with Fiona (Dominique Abel), a restaurant manager, accidentally getting locked in the establishment's walk-in freezer. After nearly dying in the grip of the sub-zero temperatures, she narrowly escapes. The experience imprints her brain with an obsession with cold, and she leaves her life and family behind to seek passage to an iceberg in the small sailboat of a deaf-mute fisherman. If the story wasn't kooky enough, this nearly wordless spectacle is absolutely hilarious as this group of actors (three of whom are also listed as the directors, which leads me to believe this may be some sort of comedy troop) perform some classic slapstick on their way to the Arctic wonderland. There is something both sweet and dark about the whole affair, but that only heightens the comedy of this tasty film I think would play very well to audiences in this country. The film plays on Saturday, March 10 at 6:15pm.
Red Road
One of the downright creepiest offerings this year is writer-director Andrea Arnold's Red Road, a film that begins with the story of a woman (Kate Dickie) who works as a closed-circuit television monitor, watching over dozens of small monitors that reveal some of the nastier parts of a Glasgow neighborhood. If she sees something bad happen or about to happen, she calls the cops and her job is done. At first I thought this film might turn into a Rear Window rip-off, but thankfully that's not what happens. The woman spots a familiar face (Miami Vice's Tony Curran) on the bank of monitors, and you can almost see her blood turn cold. She takes it upon herself to track the guy down and infiltrate his life and circle of friends. It's clear he doesn't recognize her, so we're not sure at first what their connection is. Eventually she seduces him in an intensely graphic scene that is both weirdly erotic and utterly tense and mystifying. The film's final act is something of a let down, but revealing the true nature of this relationship would have to be since the reality could never be as interesting as what our mind has speculated up to this point. Director Arnold (she made the Oscar-winning short film WASP a couple years back) has a gift for taking these seemingly unremarkable people and giving them emotionally devastating lives. Dickie's performance is sad and moving, and she has a face I won't soon forget. Red Road is part of an interesting experiment conceived by Danish filmmakers Lone Scherfig and Anders Thomas Jensen, who are credited with conceiving these characters. Three directors will write and shoot three films set in Scotland with the same cast playing essentially the same character but in completely different stories. I don't think the other two films have been made yet, but I'd be curious to see how this exercise plays out. The film is playing Friday, March 9 at 6pm, and Saturday, March 10 at 8pm.

How come we get so many films about serial killers, teen-age libidos, and the Second World War, but nothing about giant mutant tadpoles? The imbalance has always struck me as unjust, and some of us have considered forming a pressure group to lobby for the inclusion of giant mutant tadpoles in mainstream cinema. Now the pressure is off, thanks to "The Host." The director is Bong Joon-ho, and the mainstream in question is the Han, which flows through the center of Seoul. The rapid economic advance of South Korea in the nineteen-sixties and seventies is commonly known in the region as "the Miracle on the Han." Here comes the downturn.
In the opening scene, a load of old formaldehyde, tipped down the drain by a lab technician, ends up in the waters of the Han. A few years later, we see the result, though we can't quite make out what we are looking at: a dark, bulbous, comma-shaped form, drooping from the struts of a bridge. Slowly, it unfurls, like an Olympic diver, and drops neatly into the water. The good people of Seoul, amused by such novelty, toss beer cans at it and take snapshots on their cell phones. One of them glances sideways, at which point amusement comes to a halt-unlike the beast, which has hopped onto the embankment and is now pounding toward the crowd, plainly in search of a snack to go with the beer. Reading from back to front, we find: a lashing tail, which also functions as a lasso; legs as thick as a dinosaur's, with claws that can churn up concrete; eyes as dull as glue; and a mouth that seems to peel open in many directions at once. The whole package is the size of a Greyhound bus, and extremely vexed about something. It looks like Broderick Crawford crossed with a Venus flytrap.
Observing the monster is Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a slob who runs a nearby food stand. He has yellow hair, the ability to fall asleep at any time, and-somewhat to our surprise-a young daughter, Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung). She gets caught up in the crowd's chaotic flight from the monster, which promptly kidnaps her and, in obedience to the rules of fairy tale, bears her off to its lair. The rest of the film charts the efforts of Gang-du, aided by his family, to retrieve his only child from the dripping, bone-strewn sewer where she now resides. The story drags slightly in the middle, but there is no mistaking the rampant acceleration of the final act, in which all those present are called upon to save a life and, in so doing, to fulfill the task for which each of them is essentially equipped. For example, the hero's sister, Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na), is a professional archer-always handy for those pesky dragonslaying situations that crop up so often these days. Her other brother, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), spends half the movie complaining that, as a college graduate, he can't get a job, whereupon, at the climax, he turns into an angry student-preparing Molotov cocktails, like a soixante-huitard, and lobbing them at the leathery flanks of his foe.
No one can claim that we live in a golden age-or a bile-green, suppurating age-of movie monsters, and there will be plenty of filmgoers who yawned through "Godzilla" in 1998 and swore off large amphibians for good. All I can say, to tempt them back, is that I have seen "The Host" twice and have every intention of watching it again. Anyone who has taken the plunge into recent Korean movies ("Lady Vengeance" and "Oldboy," say) will know that their impact springs not just from the verve of the storytelling but from a tendency to hurtle energetically from one mood to the next, merrily swapping the lyrical for the sadistic. It is as if Korean directors, refusing to observe the niceties of genre, offered value for money by packing several movies into one. The trick with "The Host," the most successful release in the history of Korean cinema, is therefore to unpack it and inspect the contents.
The first component is shock, without which no monster movie can hope to thrive. "The Host" delivers a fine series of jolts, as the beast, which uses the industrial architecture of Seoul as an acrobat uses the parallel bars, swings suddenly out of the darkness. More unorthodox is the visual gag near the beginning, when Gang-du, fleeing the rampage, takes hold of his daughter's hand, then loses it in the rush. The screen slows and turns quiet; his hand gropes for hers and finds it again, at which point we pull back to reveal that he has grabbed the wrong girl. This is typical of Bong Joon-ho: the setting may be outlandish, but the emotion-every parent's fear-could hardly be more rooted in the real.
Second, there is the yuck factor. "The Host" is not especially bloody, and it will hold limited appeal for those macho viewers who like to test and prove themselves by cackling through a film like "Hostel," which was little better than a dramatized abattoir. Nonetheless, the special effects have an insidious slither of their own. They were created by the Orphanage, the California company that worked on "Hellboy," "Sin City," and recent installments of Harry Potter and "Pirates of the Caribbean." What the wizards have conjured for "The Host," though, takes me back to the heyday of John Carpenter-specifically, to the flowering nastiness of "The Thing." The emphasis is not on weaponry (the best defense turns out to be a metal pole) but on the organic, as befits a beast that was spawned by environmental pollution-watch it regurgitate victims like a mother disgorging fish to its young in "March of the Penguins." At one point, Hyun-seo leaps into the air and stays there. For a few seconds, we don't get it. (Bong likes to prolong the spell.) Then we switch angles, and all becomes clear: the girl is held aloft in the coils of the monster's sticky tail.
Third, Bong, like Carpenter, treats authority with the scorn of the prankster at the back of the class. Anyone in a uniform is fair game. Some guy in a yellow protective suit, seeking to inform the public of what has occurred on the Han, soon gives up and suggests weakly that people watch it on TV. When the girl's family is held in a hospital, following rumors that the beast may be the source-the host-of a menacing virus, we get a delicate probing of the generational split. Gang-du's father is all for mollifying the doctors, trying to slip them a sweetener in cash, whereas the son wants to muscle his way out as fast as possible. This niggle of disrespect lends the film a nervous litheness; we want the monster quelled, and order restored, but what, exactly, is so peaceful about the status quo? 
All of which leads to the director's fourth and most unlikely virtue: he makes you laugh. Moreover, he keeps doing so in the wrong-or, at any rate, the least laughable-places. This was demonstrated in his earlier movie "Memories of Murder" (2003), in which detectives and forensic experts arriving to study a corpse kept slipping on an embankment and landing on their behinds, like extras in a Mack Sennett comedy. Many graceful directors-Jacques Tati, obviously, but also Krzysztof Kieslowski-have been drawn to the sheer gracelessness of humanity, as if there were something endearing in our habit of falling (or tumbling) short of that noble dignity which, when sitting comfortably, we like to ascribe to ourselves. The most destabilizing scene in "The Host" comes as Gang-du and the others wail with grief before a photograph of Hyun-seo, whom they believe to be dead, and make such a spectacle of themselves, writhing like eels, that despite ourselves we snicker at their collapse. Such maladroit behavior is unusual in a monster flick, where you expect at least a modicum of cool; you can't really imagine Sigourney Weaver, at the climax of "Aliens," tripping over her own flamethrower. 
Given all that, it may seem perverse to hail "The Host" as a thing of beauty, yet that is what it is: a perfect mixture of the silly and the grave. In 1954, the art critic David Sylvester, impatient with the accepted canon, wrote a review of "Them!," in Encounter, in which he described it as "a frightening, imaginative, beautifully written B-movie-style SF film about giant ants, exactly the sort of film the professional critics could be guaranteed not to latch on to." Time to make amends. We have shifted from ants to tadpoles ("The Host" could easily have been titled "It!"), but the style is intact. Take the gorgeous wide shot of the Han River, early in the film, with rain gusting across the surface and a hint of something more than murky stirring in its depths. Then leapfrog to the last scene: we are back at Gang-du's food stand, after dark, with adult and child sharing a heaped table of food. On the television, there is news about the beast-a report, voiced by American officials, about the unseemly events in Seoul. The feasters in the shack, who, after all, were principal players in that drama, want nothing more to do with it: "Should we watch something else?" "Let's turn it off. Concentrate on eating." The whole flustered panoply of TV, camera crews, and cell phones that has flashed and clicked throughout the movie is turned off, making way for a glimpse of an older, more peaceable Korea. We move outside for a closing image worthy of Fellini: the small hut, so light and festive within, warmed by the steam of rice, is marooned in a landscape of night and drifting snow. Anything could be out there.

  Jul. 30, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- Setting box office records in its native homeland of Korea, The Host is a family drama with a twist. It's really a monster movie, or one stuck amidst the story of a family desperately seeking their youngest member. The somewhat sluggish pacing and numerous unexplained occurrences are cause for concern, but Host is a still a wild ride. 
Blatantly putting the blame on the US (and based on true events), formaldehyde is dumped into a Korean river, spawning a grotesque yet innovative-looking beast looking to munch on some film extras. Its first appearance is a monster classic, bravely shot in broad daylight amongst a city backdrop and loads of people. The special effects are on par with anything coming out of America, and it continually strives to prove this, including a secondary action sequence set in a massive downpour. 
While that may indicate non-stop action, this is a subdued effort from director Joon-ho Bong. The central characters are a small family composed of varied and well-thought out contrasts. Hae-il Park is the klutz, yet also the hero willing to risk it all to save anyone in need. The film stays on a strict path in terms of development, and stays with scenes to ensure the proper tone is intact. 
There is also a strong layer of comedy here, even though the story takes critical downhill swings into heavy drama. The lighter tone breaks up some of the tension, and it initially feels awkward. Laughing at a funeral is tough to do, while the script work and ridiculous (in a good way) performances sell the idea. 
With the amount of time spent on jokes and basic conversation between the family unit, you can't help but begin layering questions on top of questions about the story. A virus subplot is baffling and confusing without adequate explanation. The initial means of inadvertently creating the creature likewise should have spawned countless more. There is no science involved to explain the monster, and this comes with a cost. Some of its actions are then likewise lost on the viewer, such as why it eats some people and leaves others in its sewer lair alive. 
That said, The Host is a unique piece of creature feature filmmaking. It's not easy to stand out in a market of generic direct-to-cable knock-offs and box office duds such as the 1998 Godzilla remake. The attention to detail with its characters is what helps this effort rise above the typical clichés and predictable finale.            >
The film translates beautifully to the hi-def format. Color is beautiful, rich, and full. Contrast with the black levels creates an amazing image on screen. Finer details such as details in the clothing and backdrops are high. The only downer is some excessive film grain, and it's consistent throughout.            >
Numerous audio options are available, and none disappoint. The leader is the Korean DTS-HD mix, packed with consistent rear speaker usage that captures the creature.s movements as it makes its attacks. The downside is overwhelming bass. The footsteps of the monster are far too powerful, especially given its fleet-footed nature and rather small stature. Godzilla doesn't take steps that rattle a house like this.            >
This is a packed HD DVD experience, pulling over all of the two-disc features available on the standard DVD release. Making of the Host is a 10-minute feature that is mostly the director discussing his concepts and ideas for the film. Behind the scenes footage comes later in the special features. 
Memories of the Sewer is one of the more unique looks at filmmaking to find its way onto a home video format. It's rare to hear actors complain, but they do that here en masse. No sets were built, and film crews shot in an actual sewer line, unclean, biological waste and all. It's a shame it's only 10 minutes, as the stories are simply unheard of (such as the prop department gathering dead animals to use as 
Physical special effects is a brief five minute feature dealing with how to create gas for the finale and the plates for the eventual CG work. Designing the Creature runs 11 minutes. It focuses on why the monster looks like it does while throwing massive amounts of conceptual artwork at the viewer. 
Puppet Animatronix follows, and runs seven minutes. There's some great footage here of the unpainted puppet head being pulled off the truck after being delivered from the US effects company as it captures the initial reactions of the Korean crew. This is the precursor to Animating the Creature, a 10-minute rundown of the American CG crew's efforts, including extended examples of how they pull it off. 
Bringing the Creature to Life is the longest documentary piece, running 20 minutes. It's interesting to see how the American crew kept a line of communication with those in Korea via numerous technology applications. There is some redundant material here, especially when it comes to the animatics. Likewise, many of the storyboards in a separate portion of the disc will seem familiar. 
The Family is a short collection of interviews with the actors about their characters. Four minutes isn't enough time to make the piece worthwhile. Training the Actors offers some fun footage of the cast learning how to use bows and guns. 
A nearly eight minute gag reel is filled with animation goofs and visual gags, along with some finished shots that don't seem to fit. An additional eight minutes are spent on deleted scenes that would have only served to further slow down the drama. The original Korean trailer is included as is a solo commentary by director Joon-ho Bong. It's a shame the cast didn't take part in the latter, as stories from the set seem numerous if the other features are true.            >
A remake is due out in 2008, continuing a trend of remaking Asian films for an American market. While it's highly unlikely the shifts in tone will be handled as well, there's hopefully a chance we'll learn more about the creature itself. Cleaning up the plot holes is a crucial piece of the film.            Matt Paprocki is the reviews editor for            Digital Press, a classic video game website which he called home after his fanzine (Gaming Source) published its final issue.

2.5/5
THE HOST
(M, 118 minutes) On general release
The prologue to The Host is based on an actual incident that occurred in South Korea in February 2000. At a morgue inside a US Army base in Seoul, an American doctor (Scott Wilson) orders his reluctant Korean assistant to pour hundreds of bottles of formaldehyde down the drain, the toxic chemicals making their way into the Han River. The rest of Bong Joon-ho's entertaining but overlong monster movie has no reported precedent in real life - but you never know what you're not being told, do you? The action begins in October 2006 when picnickers and others on the banks of the river are startled by the sight of a strange, amphibious creature hanging upside down from a bridge. 
Moments later, in a brilliantly staged sequence, they're fleeing for their lives, pursued by the giant, finned mutant. Among them are a slacker (Song Gang-ho) and his little girl (Ko A-sung), who become key players in the action that follows. Bong's film pivots on the aftermath of the initial panic and on the bumbling authorities' eventual attempts to rid the city of the creature, which is also believed to be the host of a deadly virus. When their efforts fail, the US, always happy to help out an ally, deploys the deadly "Agent Yellow" against the enemy. However, while Bong's film takes some easy political pot shots, its most distinctive features are the often-startling visual effects, the uneasy mixture of humour and horror and the cliffhanger cutting between sequences. The mixture of CGI and animation - by The Orphanage in San Francisco, under the supervision of animator Kevin Rafferty (Toys, Shark Tale, The Phantom Menace) - never manages to duplicate the impact of the stunning opening, but ensures that you always know this is a monster that means business.

'The Host,' an intense, wickedly funny take on Asian monster flicks

An update of the classic Asian monster movies of yore, ''The Host'' boasts a wicked sense of humour and vastly improved special effects. (Not once do you see a zipper up the back of a rubber suit.)
Korean writer-director Bong Joon-Ho has crafted a film that just kicks butt from start to finish, even though its anti-American sentiment feels a bit half-baked. He is clearly well-acquainted with the genre, though, and is confident enough in his abilities to make it his own.
Reminiscent of another recent smart, sly horror movie, 2004's ''Shaun of the Dead,'' ''The Host'' begins with a dry, frequently absurd comic sensibility but steadily grows darker, more intense and truly thrilling.
Pollution in Seoul's Han River (caused by a thoughtless American scientist, naturally) gives birth to a freakishly large, angry, mutant fish that's a marvel to behold _ the product of a collaboration between the visual effects specialists at Weta Workshop (the ''Lord of the Rings'' trilogy) and The Orphanage (''Sin City'').
The creature is at once familiar and unlike anything you've seen before. It swings gracefully from bridges, leaps from the water to lash people with its long tail, and frequently just hops up on shore and runs after its prey. And the first time we see it, it thunders onto the scene _ no oppressively melodramatic music to accompany its arrival, which makes it even more powerful. The monster knows how to make an entrance (and so does Bong.)
Oh, did we mention? The fish has feet. And several buggy eyes that sprout all over its scaly head and a mouth that opens like a tulip to suck people in and either a) spit them back out or b) devour them to their bones. Very clever and cool.
One of the victims it picks up and scampers off with is teenage schoolgirl Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung), which forces her slacker dad, Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), and the rest of her dysfunctional family to spring into action to rescue her.
Hyun-seo's aunt, Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na), is a competitive archer with a propensity for choking at the most crucial moments (though her skills do come in handy as the film progresses). Her uncle, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), is the family's comparative success story. He actually has a college degree, though he has no job. And family patriarch Heui-bong (Byeon Heui-bong) runs a longtime food stand on the banks of the river, where Gang-du works but mostly snoozes.
At first they assume Hyun-seo is dead, along with countless others who fell in the path of the monster's rampage; rather than console each other, they collapse in a pile of kicking and slapping and laying blame for her fate. But then they receive a scratchy cell phone call from the sewer and realize she's still alive _ and that they must save her, even though they have absolutely no clue what they're doing.
They're a Korean version of the ''Little Miss Sunshine'' clan, complete with a minivan (which they've stolen), which would seem annoyingly trite if it weren't so curiously charming in itself. They're so well developed, you really grow to care about these people.
Meanwhile, a hysteria is spreading across the region, as it seems anyone who came into contact with the monster is carrying a deadly virus (hence the title). The government borrows a U.S. military device for cleansing the area: the very mysterious Agent Yellow, which causes nothing but paranoia and panic. Basically, everything American in the film causes paranoia and panic, a political concept Bong broaches but never truly fleshes out.
But the director does know how to create a mood that tingles with suspense; he grabs you and doesn't let go, and he doesn't go for the easy ending. And that's anti-American too, in the best possible way. Three stars out of four.

EIFF, The Host (Guimul) Cameo ***** NOT surprisingly the centre of a bidding war after its screening in Cannes, The Host (Guimul) was allegedly sold to producers on the basis of a picture of the Loch Ness monster stuck on a postcard of Seoul's Han River. From such humble beginnings, South Korean director Bong Joon-ho has crafted a terrifying, hysterical and exhilarating piece of cinema. The start of the film is based on a real event in 2000, when staff at a US military morgue in Seoul poured hundreds of bottles of chemicals down the drain and into the Han River. 
Jumping forward two years it shows two fishermen, who inadvertently catch a small unseen creature in a cup. Before they can determine what it is ("Have you ever seen anything with so many tails?") it is dropped back in the river. Four years later a businessman stares down at the black waters of the river, shouting to his colleagues "there's something dark in the water" before throwing himself to his death. The director then slows the pace to present the world of the film's main characters - sleepy food stall owner Park Kang-du, his elderly father and his young daughter Hyun-seo - before storming into the first appearance of the creature, a thrilling sequence which builds to a truly shattering climax. First glimpsed hanging from a bridge, the strange beast is initially a curiosity to the crowds, who throw it food and beer to see if it will do anything exciting. And it does, appearing in all its CGI glory and rampaging around the shore, attacking everything in sight, before grabbing Hyun-seo and disappearing into the river. As the government steps in and people begin to panic at news that the beast carries a deadly virus, Kang-du discovers that his daughter is still alive in the sewers and with the help of his father, drunken brother and Olympic archery star sister, sets off to rescue her. An unashamed monster movie at heart, this is anything but predictable and veers off on the most unlikely and sometimes bewildering tangents. It has plenty of shocks and thrills, as well as some quite incredible humour. Song Kang-ho is excellent as Kang-du, a sleepy, somewhat retarded figure who, despite his many failings, is willing from the first to take on the monster. And newcomer Ko Ah-sung is superb as his tough but terrified daughter. With a great story, superb direction and a truly memorable monster, this is as enjoyable a film as you're likely to see all year. Screens today at Cineworld

David Edelstein discusses "The Host"

DAVID BIANCULLI, guest host:
In the year 2000, a US military civilian employee in Seoul, South Korea, ordered a Korean subordinate to dump a large amount of formaldehyde into a sewer pipe leading to the Han River. The incident aroused violent anti-American sentiment in Korea and led to the birth of a monster--a monster movie called "The Host." Film critic David Edelstein has a review.
Mr. DAVID EDELSTEIN: The Korean hit "The Host" is built like your standard issue grade B giant monster attacks a city picture, but it's tone is all over the map. Now it's a horror movie, now a dark political satire, now a dysfunctional family psychodrama that's like a grisly reworking of "Little Miss Sunshine." I have friends who are bugged by its mad shifts in tone, but that's what I enjoyed, the switchback ride from pathos to farce to gut-bucket exploitation. It turns out that the marauding giant monster genre is fabulously elastic. You can learn a lot about a society by how it copes with a marauding giant monster. Describing this particular monster is a challenge. It's kind of a slithery, bounding, mandibled squid-like reptile with nasty fangs. It seems to relish gobbling people down. It also seems to relish regurgitating their bones in front of horrified onlookers. One more thing, it's American, in so far as it was born of formaldehyde dumped into the Han River on the orders of a military officer played by Scott Wilson. The kirector and co-writer, Bong Joon-ho, does not depict the US military presence on the Korean peninsula with affection. Not only does the American-spawned creature wreak havoc on Korean leisure activities, the virus it apparently hosts triggers a secondary chamber of horrors. People who've been exposed are rounded up and quarantined, with American Army doctors leading the charge. But the heart of "The Host" is a family saga. The monster carries off an adolescent girl named Hyun-seo, and please forgive my Korean pronunciation. The creature is pissed off at the girl's father, Gang-Du, a pudgy ne'er-do-well with dyed blond hair and narcolepsy, who nonetheless clobbered it with a heavy pole while it was chomping some sunbathers. The beast keeps the girl alive amid the corpses, future meals, in its sewer lair. But she gets hold of a cell phone and calls her dad, who's, unfortunately, in medical quarantine. In the unstable society of "The Host," family is the only thing you can rely on. The problem is that Hyun-seo's family is nuts. Much of "The Host" revolves around the father's effort to escape his American captors and rescue his daughter, but he and his brother and sister are borderline inept. The brother is a perpetual student who's never gotten over the ineffectual pro-democracy riots of his youth. The sister is a near champion archer, brilliant, until it's time to let the last arrow fly, when she's paralyzed. This family, along with the elderly father and their looney tunes passions, which are staged to look both genuine and ridiculous, nudges the movie out of the B monster class and into weirder territory. As scary as the monster is a demented American surgeon played by Paul Lazar, who, for political cover-up reasons, wants to give Gang-Du some kind of lobotomy. I've made "The Host" sound like a romp, but it's actually pretty grim. People we care about don't survive, and it's hard to shake off the first sight of the creature in the far distance, hanging from the side of a bridge like a pupa, then sliding into the water and gliding toward the shore of the riverfront park to the oohs and ahs of the people on their picnic blankets who rush over and throw food to it, not realizing they're about to become its food. But the reason "The Host" transcends the genre is that it's a fun house mirror reflection of its country's deepest anxieties, a cauldron in which resentment of the US, a younger generation's feeling of powerlessness and a zest for monster movies mingle and give birth to a mandibled, slithery, squid-like carnivorous reptile. It's utterly absurd, but it has the tang of social realism.

'The Host' fails to deliver thrills with killer tadpole

With the abundance of slasher films taking over the horror genre at the box office, Hollywood seems to have shied away from making the "monster" film in attempts to scare audiences. Gone are films like "Godzilla" and "Mimic," replaced instead by "Turistas" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."
For whatever reason, Hollywood producers have deemed giant monsters no longer scary enough to warrant lavish budgets and productions. Fans of the fading genre received cause to hope when it was announced that the South Korean monster film "Gwoemul" would be released in the U.S. under the title "The Host."
As a highly anticipated foreign film, expectations were high that "The Host" would become the next "Jaws" upon its stateside release. Unfortunately, somewhere between a tadpole being mutated into a giant tadpole and people trying to kill it with Molotov cocktails, the film falls far short of these expectations.
The movie begins when a U.S. military facility dumps toxic chemicals into Seoul's Han River, eventually causing an innocent tadpole to morph into a giant, man-eating tadpole. When it comes of age, the ungainly looking monster decides to wreak havoc on the residents of Seoul, eating some and taking others back to its sewer lair.
One victim whom the monster keeps alive is Hyun-seo, the granddaughter of Park Hee-bong, who operates a snack bar on the banks of the river. Although the U.S. military declares quarantine throughout the entire city, Park and his three dysfunctional children decide to ignore this to try to hunt and kill the giant tadpole, thus rescuing Hyun-seo.
The problem with "The Host" is that it tries to combine several movies into one. There is a storyline about the deadbeat single father trying to raise a daughter. There is a storyline about a family trying to cope with its emotional difficulties. There is an undercurrent of satire about U.S. involvement in an affair that should rightfully be handled by South Korea. And hanging over all of this is a storyline about a giant mutant tadpole.
No matter that any of these stories could have potential if developed properly -- they are so lazily developed by director Joon-Ho Bong that no one ends up caring at the end of the film which characters will live or die. More often than not, humor arises -- unintentionally -- out of situations in the film, even in what should be a sad scene when the family is mourning the death of one of their own.
The most depressing aspect of "The Host" is that the monster is not scary. The CGI is poor and the monster mostly lumbers around like a St. Bernard, making it funnier than anything else. We assume that the monster is a "host," but this is not made clear, nor is there anything at the end of the movie to frighten viewers that the mutant has spawned offspring that will continue to terrorize society.
The two-hour running time seems to drag on interminably, and at the film's conclusion, one wonders whether the plot could have been carried out in half the time so as to endure only half the pain.
There is a chance that "The Host" is intentionally trying to be a B-list movie, but it fails at that goal. It also fails to do what a good monster movie should do -- make the viewer fear the monster.
Viewers can rest assured that if they choose to endure "The Host," they will be no more afraid of tadpoles coming out of the theater as they did going in to it.

"The Host" is going to appeal to you whether you want it to or not. Mixing elements of horror, science fiction, action, comedy, family and political drama, this film stops at nothing to please its audience -- and that's a good thing. The new film from the incredibly successful Korean director Bong Joon-Ho ("Memories of Murder") is a monster of a movie, and American audiences might not be ready.
The movie begins with an environmental hazard that creates an enormous monster which proceeds to crawl out of the Han River and eat people. Gang-Du Park, the owner of a small snack bar and one of the laziest movie heroes of all time, is forced into action when the monster carries his daughter away. He enlists the help of his "loser family," as the director lovingly refers to them, and they set out to find the girl. Unfortunately, the government descends upon the city to quarantine a virus related to the monster, impeding the family's progress more than the monster itself.
You may not realize it from the above description, but this movie is really funny. It has an absurdist sense of humor that can be really jarring if you are not ready for it. Whereas an American monster movie might have a few jokes in it, this film has full-on set pieces of insanity. Some of the highlights early on include a memorial scene that degrades into a mass tantrum of grief and a containment unit that could be easily confused for a body bag. The humor is dark and mostly aimed at the government's heartlessness in dealing with its citizens, and the family's general ineptitude in dealing with life.
Bong credits images and news reports of SARS and the misinformation surrounding the WMDs in Iraq as inspirations for his movie. The film even flirts with anti-Americanism in its depiction of American imperialism. American military troops threaten to spray "Agent Yellow" in an effort to kill off the monster, not caring that every other living thing will also be killed. The initial polluting of the river is actually based on a real event that occurred in Korea after an American military official forced his workers to pour toxic waste down kitchen sinks in the sewer system. There is no out-and-out political message here, but the movie definitely offers you something more than mindless entertainment. The best monster movies are never really about monsters. Be it the fears of atomic power in "Godzilla" and half a dozen giant animal movies or the Sept. 11 hysteria and paranoia in Steven Spielberg's "War of the Worlds," the best monster scares usually come wrapped in political commentary. In fact, Joon-Ho references Spielberg's work "before E.T." and American cinema of the '70s as having relevance to his take on genre entertainment. This movie definitely has a connection to "Jaws," claims Joon-Ho, as he uses the similar themes of "confusion and group hysteria" to create a panicked world for his characters to inhabit rather than relying on the monster.
Don't worry, though, it is a monster movie, and the monster is pretty cool. Although it is mostly created through CGI, it's CGI from the people who worked on "King Kong" and "Sin City," so it's sleek, realistic and allows for one or two awesome flips. (Speaking of monsters and American imperialism, the remake rights have already been bought by Universal Studios.) The depiction of the family and the humor are so different from American genre entertainment that it seems, like most Asian films, impossible to translate this to an American setting. So go see "The Host" before something akin to the American "Godzilla" is unleashed upon us all.

> Unusual foreign mix of monster movie and family dramedy.
The most successful and expensive Korean film ever produced received terrific reviews and brisk arthouse business in the U.S. And it's easy to see why, for this is not only a dazzling technical achievement but a surprisingly complex affair spiked with political satire and pathos that also happens to be quite funny. Think Jaws  meets Little Miss Sunshine , and you get an idea of what to expect from a movie wherein a teenage girl is wrested away from her family snack shop near the Han River by a gigantic amphibious creature. The girl's fractured family-which includes a slacker father and an aunt who happens to be an archery expert-has to put aside their differences to track her down before it's too late. At the same time, the government claims the beast is the product of a mysterious virus and begins putting citizens into quarantine, which puts a big crimp in the clan's rescue plans. Director Joon Ho-Bong (Memories of Murder ) does a miraculous job juggling all the seemingly disparate elements.
Shelf Talk : Word-of-mouth is definitely in this title's favor, but it's up to retailers whether they want to market it as a foreign film. The precedent for the genre can be seen in such titles as Brotherhood of the Wolf  and such Asian imports as Oldboy  and the Ringu  films, so retailers may want to have The Host  follow in those films' footsteps.
Horror, R (mature themes, language, violence), 119 min.; DVD $26.99, Collector's Edition DVD $29.99, Collector's BD or HD $34.99
Extras: deleted scenes, commentary; Collector's Edition also has making-of featurettes, storyboards, gag reel, casting tapes
