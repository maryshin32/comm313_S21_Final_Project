[{"text": "Jan 27, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite[1] is taking Hollywood by storm[2] this award season. In fact, the South Korean release is gearing up as a Best Picture frontrunner[3] heading into Oscars 2020. Director Bong Joon-ho's latest film defies genre to tell a complex story about two interconnected families and, by extension, delivers some crucial social commentary[4].With Parasite#8216;s success, we're sure moviegoers will be interested to see some of Bong's previous work. Prior to his Oscar-nominated hit[5], the director had made six films. Here's a quick breakdown of the features he has directed throughout his career. \n Bong Joon-ho and the cast of #8216;Parasite' at the Screen ActorsGuild Awards | John Sciulli/Getty Images for Turner#8216;Barking Dogs Never Bite' (2000)Barking Dogs Never Bite (Trailer)[6]In his 2000 directorial debut, Bong already aimed to combine genres in an innovative way. This dark comedy-drama follows an unemployed college professor (Lee Sung-jae) who begins abusing and kidnapping dogs the barking dogs in his apartment building. At the same time, a young woman (Bae Doona) takes note of his activities, launching an investigation into the surge of missing dogs. Despite its bizarre-sounding premise, Barking Dogs Never Bite gave Bong the chance to try his hand at directing a feature. Prior to this film, the [7]Parasite[8] filmmaker[9] had only directed three short films. However, he previously earned writing credits on 1997's Motel Cactus and 1999's Phantom: The Submarine. #8216;Memories of Murder' (2003)Memories of Murder (2003) - movie trailer[10]In his 2003 sophomore effort, Bong landed his first collaboration with Song Kang-ho. The actor delivers a critically acclaimed standout performance in [11]Parasite[12]. Song has sustained an ongoing collaboration with Bong over the course of both their careers.In Memories of Murder, the actor andKim Sang-kyung play two detectives trying to solve the real-life case of Korea's first serial murders. The investigation continued from 1986 to 1991, and the film \u2014 based on a 1996 play \u2014 earned strong reviews for its depiction and performances. #8216;The Host' (2006)The Host (2006) #8212; Trailer[13]Memories of Murder gained Bong international acclaim. But The Host solidified him as a commercially successful filmmaker. The film follows a man's (Song) effort to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped by a giant monster.At the time of its release, The Host became the highest-grossing South Korean movie of all time. Although mainstream success in the United States eluded Bong, this film was a critical step in establishing his reputation for offbeat, inventive genre projects.  #8216;Mother' (2009)Mother Official HD Trailer - From the Director of THE HOST[14]No, this one has nothing to do with either the 1996 Albert Brooks film or the 2017 Darren Aronofsky release[15]. Rather, this Mother follows a mother's (Kim Hye-ja) search for the killer responsible for framing her son (Won Bin) for murder.It might not have received as much attention stateside as some of Bong's other films. However, Mother was still a critical smash in South Korea and beloved by critics. As has become Bong's trademark, the movie expertly combines a number of genres, including family drama, horror, and comedy. #8216;Snowpiercer' (2013)Snowpiercer Official US Release Trailer #1 (2014) - Chris Evans Movie HD[16]Bong made his English-language directorial debut with this dystopian sci-fi thriller. Led by Chris Evans, the film features an all-star cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Ed Harris, and \u2014 of course \u2014 Song. It's also the most expensive Korean production in history.Snowpiercer is set aboard the titular train, which carries the last remnants of the human race. The film tackles key issues such as climate change but does so in a way that never fails to be thrilling. In fact, its success \u2014 much like that of [17]Parasite[18] \u2014 has inspired a new TV series[19]. #8216;Okja' (2017)Okja | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix[20]This Netflix film might be a lot of moviegoers' first exposure to Bong. Part of that comes from its accessibility on the streaming service. Yet, Okja \u2014 Bong's second consecutive English-language release[21] \u2014 is just as much in line with his distinctive sensibility as his other films.The movie centers on a genetically modified creature named Okja, its friendship with a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun), and her efforts to protect it. Okja also features an international cast which combines South Korean performers with stars like Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and Swinton.

A family of four, living in a semi-basement level home, scouts the corners of their house to find WiFi signal. The neighbour must have changed the password, let's try 123456789 or in reverse. Still not working? Oops, no WhatsApp then.\nKim Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho) leads an unambitious family with wife Chung-sook (played by Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Kim Ki-jeong (played by Park So-dam) and son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik). Their current source of income is folding pizza boxes for a pizza delivery joint, and it doesn't take someone solid knowledge in World Cinema to know that that money isn't going to be enough to feed four grown mouths. But, they have a plan, as Kim Ki-taek elaborates - it is to not have a plan at all. For then, the risk of anything going wrong is nil.\nWatch the trailer of Parasite here:\nParasite is, therefore, a story of submission. On one end of the spectrum, the Kim family has submitted to their condition never improving, of scavenging through life. On the other end of the spectrum, the Park family has submitted to never peeping out of their ivory towers. They don't need to. Their ivory towers are guarded with surveillance cameras and windows are sealed with tempered glasses, monitoring even the sunlight seeping in. Led by Park Dong-ik (played by Lee Sun-kyun) with wife Yeon-gyo (played by Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Park Da-hye (played by Jeong Ji-so) and son Park Da-song (played by Jung Hyeon-jun), the Park family doesn't live in a bubble; they live in a fortress, fortified by wilful ignorance.\nRead: Why Bong Joon Ho's Parasite rises beyond the subtitle barrier\nAnd then their worlds collide. The Kim family slowly and steadily creeps into the Park family, landing odd jobs with them, eliminating the competition as they move ahead. The son takes up the job of the English tutor replacing a friend, the daughter becomes the art teacher to the son, playing a hapless (and clueless) mother; the father lands the job of the driver replacing the older one, and finally, the older housekeeper is practically thrown out overnight and replaced with the mother. All this without letting the Parks catch a whiff that the Kims know each other, lest their finally steady quadruple income is snatched away. But the whiff is too strong, too strong coming from poverty.\nThe more they collide, the more apparent their differences get. They are separated by class, a difference that is almost flowing in their bloodstreams now, they are basically sweating class difference. It appears the Kims have gotten so used to living in hiding that they'd prefer living the life of a parasite, rather than disclose they are related and have a fair chance at being judged on the basis of their good work. Even they don't think they are worth it. Of course, the Parks don't either.\nThrough Parasite, Bong Joon Ho gives you a very clear picture of the South Korean society, or of any other place where unequal distribution and growth of wealth have resulted in the 'rich becoming richer, poor becoming poorer' model. This could very well be the story of a family living in the slums of Dharavi, juxtaposed against another living in that plush skyrise on Altamount Road, both in Mumbai. Which is why it hits so hard.\nIn Parasite, the cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and editing by Jinmo Yang (nominated in the Best Achievement in Film Editing category at Oscars 2020) deserve a special mention. Staring out the window at Parks', you soak in the lush green of their front yard, while at the Kims', there's a drunkard peeing at the lamppost, who wouldn't stop even if you were to throw a bucket of water at him. But the visuals of those water droplets twinkling against the light from the lamppost, in slow motion, and the good laugh the have-nots like the Kim family share at that moment, is like poetry.\nThe storytelling style of Parasite is also unique. Bong Joon Ho goes from dark comedy to absurd comedy, to simply dark, and then darker. Finally, it touches a point of hope, and while one could look at it as just hope, it could also be the point where the film reached its darkest - for there is no hope. Let's just submit to that, shall we?\nBong Joon Ho had said at an interview that the idea for Parasite had been in his brain for a while - like a parasite, if you will. We're glad he didn't get rid of it, though.\n(The Delhi premiere of Parasite was organised by the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in India.)\n(Writer tweets as @NotThatNairita)\nALSO READ |Joaquin Phoenix's Joker to re-release in India on February 14\nALSO READ | Joaquin Phoenix on Joker leading Oscars 2020 nominations: Honoured by the Academy's recognition\nALSO READ |Oscars 2020: 92nd Academy Awards full nominations list\nALSO READ | Joaquin Phoenix wins Best Actor for Joker at Golden Globes 2020: The ascent after the descent\nALSO READ | Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips may reunite for Joker sequel\nALSO READ | Joker trailer out: Joaquin Phoenix film traces the origins of Batman's most terrifying enemy\nALSO READ | Joker to now release in India on October 2, will clash with Hrithik Roshan's War\nALSO WATCH | Joaquin Phoenix's Joker gets 8 minute standing ovation at Venice Premiere\nLink to Image\n\u2028Graphic\n\n\n\n \nParasite Movie Review: Bong Joon Ho film is like poetry"}, {"text": "Feb 10, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Oscars certainly don't think Bong Joon Ho is an idiot. They honored him awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best International Feature[1] for Parasite. HBO doesn't either. They're developing a       \u00a0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bong-joon-hos-parasite-slated-for-hbo-show-what-we-know.html/TV serie[2]s based on the film. \nHowever, not everyone making Parasite was so enamored with Director[3] Bong. The architect who built the house in which Bong set the film[4] had strong words for him. Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment Parasite is now available on DVD and Blu-ray[5]. In the bonus features, Bong gives a Q&A at a film festival screening. Here is the story of why the architect of the Parasite house called Bong an idiot. Bong Joon Ho built the house into the #8216;Parasite' script The Park family house was the central location of all the events in Parasite. The Kim family installs themselves as help in the Park house and that's where things get crazy[6]. The Parks' lavish house had to be built to spec for Bong. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-sik in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;Even since we began building the set for the rich house, I had a lot of requests. I already had a basic sketch of the house structure in mind when I was writing the script. Without that certain structure, it was almost impossible to tell the narrative. Also there are a lot of things that were necessary for the story in terms of the structure. If some characters are talking here, another character had to eavesdrop or peak. You had to be able to see the staircase through the front door. There were these several requirements I had.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayBong Joon Ho consulted a real architect for #8216;Parasite' Bong sent production designer Lee Ha-jun to meet with real architects about the Parasite house. The architects were not fond of the screenplay's demands. L-R: Choi Woo-Shik, Song Kang-ho, Chang Hyae-jin and Park So-dam in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;So the production designer actually sought out advice from actual architects to build this house. The production designer would take my request to the actual architect and the architect would be like, #8216;What kind of idiot would build houses this way? No one builds houses this way. So the architect would come back to me with those comments and I would still have all these things that I requested from him. So he really suffered between me and the architect. Ultimately the house came out beautifully. I was able to get all the structure and the blocking that the story required.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayOne scene that paid off the unorthodox in #8216;Parasite' An example of a scene that utilized the specific design of the house is one in which the Kims hide in the bedroom while the Parks have sex. Bong Joon Ho and interpreter Sharon Choi | Kevin Winter/Getty Images #8216;In reality it's very rare for the rich and poor to come so close to each other that they can smell one another. In this film you have situations where they come very close to one another through tutoring or housekeeping and driving. And that sex scene is sort of on the pinnacle of that strange intimacy. It's not really about the sex. It's about the family that's hiding under the table and peeping at that very intimate part of their private lives. So I thought it would give a really powerful tension in the film.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayBong Joon Ho built more than the house The Park house was the major build for Parasite, but Bong had to build a few other sets for other scenes in the movie. Lee Sun-kyun and Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;Another thing that was difficult was the poor house and the neighborhood surrounding that house,#8217; Bong said. #8216;They were also sets that we built. Also because we had to flood the entire neighborhood, we built it in a giant swimming pool, a water tank and on the last day of shooting, we poured in sewage water. It looks like dirty water. It was very clean water for the actors. It had the face masks in the water, like mud face masks, very healthy and good for your skin.#8217; Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[7] [ 1]: https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-makes-history-with-2020-oscar-nominations-best-picture.html/ [ 2]:       \u00a0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bong-joon-hos-parasite-slated-for-hbo-show-what-we-know.html/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/oscars-2020-what-movies-has-parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-made.html/ [ 4]:       \u00a0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/beyond-fest-review-parasite-peachy-con.html/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-is-the-oscar-nominated-film-based-on-a-true-story.html/ [ 6]:       \u00a0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-explains-the-cruel-and-sad-ending-of-the-award-winning-film.html/ [ 7]:       \u00a0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-says-the-architect-of-his-movie-house-thought-he-was-an-idiot.html/"}, {"text": "President Donald Trump is apparently not a fan of Parasite, his biggest complaint being that the movie was made in South Korea.

And many metaphors.\nParasite movie cast: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam\nParasite movie director: Bong Joon-Ho\nParasite movie rating: 4 stars\nKorean director Bong Joon-Ho's latest film, a top Oscar contender, is a subtle and subversive depiction of class. The setting is Korean, and Ho brings out that country's obsession with America, English, North Korea and aspirations succinctly. But in depicting the many layers that divide, and blind, the rich from the poor, the poor from the rich, the men from the women, the husbands from the wives, Parasite is universal. And very, very unsettling.\nThe rich are not all bad, and the poor not all good. However, it is in keeping up appearances, of both goodness and badness, that we maintain what passes off as order. And so it is that the well-to-do Parks welcome into their house, one by one, an entire family who take up various jobs around their home without them being any wiser. The husband takes no interest in running the household, the wife's worth lies in ensuring that he doesn't have to. That everything from kids' grades to their art faculties, the cooking to the washing, even the hiring and the sacking, doesn't demand any exertion from him.\nThey live in a \"semi-basement\", out of work but smart, ambitious and willing to cut corners to get ahead. The first to make his way into the Park home is Kevin, a smart man whose English can rival any university student's but who is held back for lack of a degree. He is hired as Park daughter's tutor. He gets his sister in for the Park son, a little boy whose mother is convinced he has eccentric artistic talent. The sister, Jessica, convinces the Park wife that what the son's feverish scribblings indicate is a childhood trauma, which \"art therapy\", costing a little extra, will cure. Kim (a Ho favourite) comes in as the chauffeur and man about the house and his wife as the housekeeper.\nOne night when the Parks are on a camping trip, Kim and family decide to have a nice little party. They talk about how nice the Parks are, and whether it's the money that makes them so, or whether it's the fact that money means they are left with \"no resentments\". Looking on at the front yard through large French windows, as a storm builds, they are imagining owning a house such as this, when their nightmare starts.\nHo, who has also co-written the story, has several surprises and twists up his sleeve. And many metaphors. About upstairs, downstairs. Loyalty, love. Virtue, vice. Gutter, smell. Casual affluence, deliberate offence. Rain/sun, floods/heat. The wool we pull over our eyes as we turn the other way, telling ourselves some lies to help us do that, even as we draw lines that are \"not to be crossed\".\nHo strips that wool off, thread by thread. Right down to the only truth there is, not education, not degree, not work - money."}, {"text": "India, Jan. 29 -- ParasiteDirector - Bong Joon-hoCast - Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Chang Hyae-jin, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Jung-eun\nDepending on how you perceive the world, Bong Joon-ho's grand validation by the West can either be appreciated as a long-overdue acknowledgement of his formidable filmography, or it can be dismissed as yet another sign of the Oscars' irrelevance in identifying true legends. I find myself somewhere in between.\nShall I let the pomp and pageantry of the Academy Awards convince me that my respect for Bong has in some way been inadequate for all these years, or should I simply ignore the attention he's getting all of a sudden, convinced that America is simply late to the party?\nWatch the Parasite trailer here\nDirector Bong, as he's affectionately (and reverentially) addressed by his cast and crew, has made four bona fide classics in his career; each of them of a different genre. His 2003 monster movie, The Host, was seen as an admonishment of American arrogance; in Okja, he skewered the food industry like a spicy tikka; and in Snowpiercer, his finest film, Director Bong confronted the notion of God.\nBut unlike his contemporaries, Park Chan-wook or Kim Ki-duk, Bong has largely operated in genre cinema, bringing his instantly recognisable idiosyncrasies - shocking tonal shifts, razor-sharp satire and delightfully dark humour - to subjects that other directors would typically address with solemnity.\nThe genre-fluid Parasite is like a greatest hits record -- cool, clinical, and incisive. It is an outlet for him to address all of his anxieties as a filmmaker, but also as a citizen of the modern world.\nThe theme of capitalism is once again brought up as Bong pits the rich Park family against the poor Kim clan, peppering the film with references to Native Americans and building towards an operatic crescendo in which class warfare takes on the form of a literal battle. After previously tackling climate change in Snowpiercer, Bong once again highlights the importance of the crisis, by shedding light on how it affects the rich and the poor differently. While the Park family is only slightly inconvenienced by a torrential downpour, the Kims' entire existence is threatened when the same downpour floods their subterranean home.\nSometimes, Bong makes his points rather bluntly, like the scene in which the patriarch of the Kim family, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is barely able to hide his anger when the matriarch of the Park family, Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), says that the rains have cleared the skies. Mere hours ago, his home was submerged; Yeon-gyo's apathy towards Ki-taek's plight is more insulting to him than when she scrunches up her nose at his 'poor person smell'.\nThe scene takes place inside a car, which reminded me of a similar moment in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, in which Ranveer Singh's Murad is reminded of the metaphorical distance between himself and the rich woman he's driving, despite their physical proximity to each other.\nKi-taek works as a chauffeur for the Parks, after having successfully infiltrated the wealthy family with his wife and kids. Both clans rely upon the other; while the Parks wouldn't be able to function without the invisible services provided by the Kims, the Kims depend on the Parks' money to survive. There are no heroes or villains in the film; everyone's a parasite.\nBong relies on his craft to make confrontational statements about class - his use of staircases as a visual metaphor for social mobility is remarkable. Such is the regularity with which he cuts to a character either climbing or descending stairs, that Parasite begins to resemble a sort of cinematic Ludo. The Parks' magnificent bungalow is accessed after a steady uphill climb, while the Kims literally live underneath the rich and the powerful; bereft of not only wealth and opportunities, but also sunlight.\nThe Parks' home, wonderfully constructed by Bong's production designer, Lee Ha-jun, has several internal staircases, perhaps suggesting that even within certain socioeconomic groups, maintaining one's position is an equally cutthroat business. The film is shot like a thriller, and despite his typical tonal transitions, Bong alternately conjures action sequences out of mundane domesticity, and transforms verbal exchanges into elaborate psychological con-games. For one scene, involving a kitchen table and near-silence, Bong seems to have exhumed the corpse of Alfred Hitchcock and drained it of every last ounce of inspiration.\nAlso read: Roma movie review: Alfonso Cuaron has made one of the best films of the decade; a cinematic game-changer. 5 stars\nIn Parasite, Bong doesn't appear to be expressing empathy for the poor, like, say, Alfonso Cuaron did in Roma. Nor does he seem to be pointing fingers at the rich. He is, instead, questioning the very nature of mankind; its self-centred ingratitude and its propensity to create divisions and to resort to violence.\nI have now seen Parasite twice. A third viewing has, in the meantime, been scheduled. But even a dozen repeat viewings would be inadequate to unravel its many (hidden) layers. It's the best film of 2019, by far - an almost religious experience, deserving of a pilgrimage to the theatre.\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

There was absolutely no doubt that Bong Joon Ho's Parasite would whisk away this one. And it did.\nBut when this South Korean film walked away with four trophies of the six categories it was nominated in, including Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture, it is perhaps necessary to take a moment and let it all sink in. This is Oscar history - the first time a non-English film won Best Picture.\nREAD OUR REVIEW OF PARASITE\nWATCH THE TRAILER OF PARASITE\nThose who have watched Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece will admit in a heartbeat that it deserved all that it got. Some might even argue that it should have won in all 6 categories or have been nominated for more. But the question - did Parasite deserve it - needs a closer look. And more importantly, an unbiased and impartial one.\nParasite is essentially the story of two families of four - the Kims and the Parks - belonging to opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum. The Kims scavenge and make do with whatever they can grab; the Parks, are affluence personified. The Kims' semi-basement apartment floods after a torrential downpour in one part of the city. In the other, the Parks import 100 per cent waterproof tents from the US for their little son, for recreation.\nBut, their exceedingly different worlds collide, intertwine, and entangle.\nBong Joon Ho paints a perfect picture of imperfection with the poor Kim family and presents its foil in the Parks. There's not a speck of dirt on the floor at the Park residence, while the Kims have a permanent dirt line under their nails. If this kind of genius attention to detail doesn't deserve an Oscar, we don't know what does.\nWhen the Kims land jobs with the Parks, the film reaches its highest point of irony and makes you question, who are the parasite here? The obvious answer would be, the poor family who're using the rich and affluent Parks as the host. There are scenes that literally point you towards this obvious answer when the family of four are raiding the fridge and the bar at their employer's house in their absence and make it a night. And then there's the realisation of how the rich, in their entitlement and oblivion, take advantage of the poor.\nParasite, even though a reflection of the South Korean society, can easily be interchanged in an Indian context if you were only to imagine a Dharavi jhopdi against the bungalows of Altamount Road. In that, Parasite appeals to and identifies with the rich and poor class divide of absolutely any country in the world. If that successful transcendence doesn't deserve an Oscar, we don't know what does.\nIn a particular scene, when the Kims find their home flooded, the daughter surrendering to the fact that she cannot do anything to make things better crouches atop a flooding (picture bubbling) commode and lights a cigarette. The calm on her face is haunting. On the flip side, when the mother in the Park family finds out that her son might have a growth disorder, even with all the money at her disposal, has a shadow of fear eclipsing her face. If this kind of realistic portrayal of emotion doesn't deserve an Oscar, we don't know what does.\nYes, Oscars 2020 made history today. A South Korean film won Best Picture and floored us. And yes, the film deserved all that it got. Congratulations Bong Joon Ho and team. And welcome back the Academy Awards. You did well.\n(Writer tweets as @NotThatNairita)\nALSO READ | Parasite Movie Review: Bong Joon Ho film is like poetry\nALSO READ | Oscars 2020: Joaquin Phoenix and Renee Zellweger are Best Actors, Parasite wins Best Picture\nALSO READ | Oscars 2020 full winners list: Joaquin Phoenix, Renee Zellweger, Parasite win big\nALSO READ | Oscars 2020: Bong Joon Ho's Parasite makes Oscar history with Best Picture win\nALSO READ | Oscars 2020: Joaquin Phoenix wins Best Actor, Renee Zellweger bags Best Actress award\nALSO WATCH | Leonardo Di Caprio to Joaquin Phoenix, who is ahead in the Oscars 2020 race\nLink to Image\n\u2028Graphic\n\n\n\n \nHow Parasite, a non-English film, made history at Oscars 2020"}, {"text": "ABSTRACT\nFor anyone not yet familiar with Bong, Parasite is ready and eager to infect your consciousness and soul, quickly turning you into an eager host for all things Bong\nFULL TEXT\nEvery week, the film industry offers a fresh slap to the face. Between the increasing dominance of mindless franchise product and the erosion of substantive films made for discerning audiences, it is difficult to feel hopeful about stepping into the dark of a cinema - as wondrous and transformative an experience as modern life affords.\nBut this past weekend, salvation reared its head in New York and Los Angeles, where a new film smashed box-office records. The unlikely culprit: Parasite, a small-scale South Korean drama with no special effects to speak of and zero sequel or spinoff potential to tempt skeptical audiences. Thanks to audience word-of-mouth and https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff/article-tiff-2019-from-hustlers-to-joker-to-parasite-make-way-in-the/ culled       \u00a0    https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff/article-tiff-2019-the-globes-guide-to-movies-screening-at-the-festival/, Parasite earned an average of more than US$128,000 in each of the three theatres it screened, an unheard of figure for a foreign-language film, especially one unable to boast a high-concept narrative or internationally renowned star.\nParasite does, however, have one semi-known quantity to boast of: writer and director Bong Joon-ho. Arthouse-attuned moviegoers will recognize the name from his early Seoul-based dramas Mother and Memories of Murder, while anyone with a Netflix subscription will recall his https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/review-okja-an-over-the-top-blockbuster-with-a-message/article35420921/, or perhaps his politically charged sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer. But for anyone not yet familiar with Bong, Parasite is ready and eager to infect your consciousness and soul, quickly turning you into an eager host for all things Bong.\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-bong-joon-hos-parasite-is-a-four-star-polemic-sharp-enough-to-draw/       \u00a0    https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-whats-new-in-theatres-and-streaming-this-week-including-the-four/\nFollowing the messy intersection of two modern Seoul families - one clan destitute and scheming for a better life, the other perched comfortably and ignorantly at the upper crust of society - Parasite is exhilarating, thrilling, furious and deeply upsetting. It is also, and here's where things get tricky, extraordinarily surprising, with its story pivoting on a huge twist that arrives one-third through. All of which is to say: Bong hopes you see Parasite, before Parasite becomes inescapable.\n\"Thankfully, everyone has so far been really co-operative with keeping the spoilers to themselves. I've seen families eating out in Seoul, talking about the film, but once they discover there are people among them who haven't seen it, they got up and left,\" says Bong, 50. \"People are really protective of this film.\"\nIt is the opening weekend of the Toronto International Film Festival, and Bong seems deeply exhausted. The director has been discussing - and, well, not discussing - the implications of Parasite's twist since this past May, when the film had its world premiere at Cannes, bowling over critics and capturing the film festival's coveted Palme d'Or. Somehow, as the film has since travelled to Telluride and Toronto (where it would go on to win second runner-up for TIFF's People's Choice Award), Parasite's big reveal has been preserved, a testament to either audiences' newfound ability to keep something special to themselves in an era of instant spoiler-y Twitter tidal waves, or the sheer power that the film carries. Likely both.\n\"The film has been released in several countries now, and I've begun to see people diving into it as if it were a game - discussing the details, the foreshadowing of the twist, the symbolism in the film,\" Bong says, \"but no one is spoiling it. Mostly everyone, at least in the Korean online community, are talking about poverty and their own experiences. And how it's actually worse than it seems in the movie.\"\nAnd Parasite makes life on South Korea's lower rung look absolutely awful. Bong introduces the Kim family - Parasite's quasi-protagonists - as sympathetic bottom-feeders, with the foursome occupying an overcrowded basement apartment where the toilet is faulty, the WiFi must be leeched from neighbouring businesses and the air is thick with either the scent of drunkards' urine or the debilitating fog of street-level fumigation. Patriarch Kim Ki-taek (Bong regular Song Kang-ho) is desperate and clever in equal measure, but cannot seem to imagine a world even one step higher. Until, that is, his son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), sneakily scores a tutoring job for the son of wealthy tech entrepreneur Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun). Over the course of about two hours, fortunes are changed, lives are upended, and the class tensions of South Korea - or anywhere in the world, really - are stretched till they snap.\n\"As Korea went through the Korean War and the military dictatorships, we've become a very developed and rich country,\" Bong explains. \"But despite the growth, the gap between the rich and the poor has only widened. As the country over all seems wealthy and extravagant, there are still so many people who are saying, 'Why are we still struggling?' That sense of inferiority and loss, it's felt. And it's not just emotional, it's physical.\"\nIn typical Bong fashion - reminiscent of how Okja's zany corporate satire comes equipped with a too-bizarre-for-words Tilda Swinton or how The Host's family melodrama is backgrounded by a good old-fashioned monster hunt - Parasite's central themes are delivered in a blessedly shocking manner. The Kim family's slow invasion of the Parks is tightly controlled dark comedy until Bong flips the story on its head to produce a shocking and sickening tragedy. As his film's title suggests - who is the real bloodsucker here, the Kims or the Parks? - Bong doesn't so much upend expectations as he dares you to forever abandon yours.\nThe film also marks a surprising, if perhaps inevitable, return for Bong to his home country. After spending the past half-decade working if not exactly in then explicitly for Hollywood with Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite finds Bong returning to a more familiar country and language.\n\"I tend to improvise a lot on set, so it's adjusting dialogue and suggesting new ideas, so it was great to not need a translator this time, and being able to have fun with my actors,\" Bong says. \"But a lot of the joy this time came from not coming back to Korea, but to coming back to films of this size and scale. Working on Parasite was like working on Mother or Memories of Murder. Smaller, controlled, comfortable.\"\nPart of the comfort comes from having actor Song Kang-ho around once again. Although the Korean star had a supporting role in Snowpiercer, the full weight of Parasite rests on Song's sizable shoulders - a task he carries with the dedication and commitment familiar to anyone who has seen him blaze the screen in such Korean hits as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Thirst. His Parasite patriarch, at once beaten down and invigorated by a world that wants nothing to do with him, is one of the more complex and memorable characters that audiences of any culture will encounter this year.\n\"It's not as if there's a special nerve on the back heel of Song's foot that's connected to my finger, but sometimes it does feel as if we have that connection,\" Bong says of his relationship with his frequent collaborator. \"We don't talk a lot on set - we don't discuss the character for hours - but I think Song, as an actor, instinctively understands what I want to say with my script, and what we need to show with a particular scene. There's never been a time when I've disagreed with a decision in his performance.\"\nAs Parasite begins to creep further into North America - it opens in Toronto this Friday, before expanding into more Canadian theatres in November - Bong is faced with a sort of Bong-esque dilemma: Should he trust that the typical hopes for a film of his pedigree and provenance will prevail, i.e., that the film will get Academy Award attention in the Best International Film category? Or should he prepare for an upending of his own expectations, and find Parasite instead nominated in the mainstream Best Picture slot, alongside Hollywood's finest? In a tiny way, the film's fate is in his hands.\n\"Song and I have been members of the [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] for the past five years, now that the Academy is trying to increase the diversity of its membership. So this year, we talked about, 'Oh, should we vote for Parasite?' \" Bong says with a laugh. \"Is it embarrassing? Is it illegal? But anyway, it's a secret vote.\"\nAnd secrets are Bong's specialty. He'll keep his, so long as you keep Parasite's.\nParasite opens Oct. 18 in Toronto.\nLive your best.

Here's how to get up to speed.\nAlthough some folks were surprised by Sunday's Academy Award wins for South Korean director Bong Joon Ho and his movie Parasite, you could see on Oscar night that fellow nominees Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino were not among them.\nBoth are movie buffs, familiar with Bong's impressive career, and clearly knew it was only a matter of time before his work was recognized on an international scale - in fact, Parasite had already won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019.\nAlso probably not surprised? Oscar winner Brad Pitt (best supporting actor for Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood), who produced Bong's last movie Okja, released in 2017.\nFilmmakers and hard-core movie fans have been hip to Bong for years.\n\"Bong's other films have already received a good deal of recognition and praise from American critics and filmgoers,\" said Jae Won Edward Chung, assistant professor of Asian languages and cultures at Rutgers University and a Bong fan. \"Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja have A-list stars like Chris Evans and Jake Gyllenhaal, and The Host (2006) got rave reviews when it was released in the States.\"\nThey're all worth checking out, he said, but for the uninitiated, he also recommends some of the director's early, lesser known work.\n\"Most people probably haven't heard of Barking Dogs Never Bite - a quirky black comedy about a struggling academic trying to settle a score with a neighbor's dog that won't stop yapping,\" he said. \"It's probably still my favorite film by Bong Joon Ho. It doesn't take itself as seriously as his later works, and yet it has these wonderfully observed everyday moments that really haunt you for a long time after it's over.\"\nIf you want to see Parasite and some of the director's previous movies, here's what to expect and how to find them:\n>Parasite (2019). Two Korean families, one rich and one poor, intertwine in increasingly fraught ways as members of the lowerclass family take jobs in the wealthy household. Starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, and Park Sodam. The movie is still in theaters, including the Ritz Five and Bryn Mawr Film Institute. You can also rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and You-Tube.\n>Okja (2017). A Korean farm girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) lives in the mountains with a giant pig, who is removed and taken to New York, where an agribusiness CEO (Tilda Swinton) has sinister plans for the animal. The corporate agenda is undermined by animal rights activists (Paul Dano, Steven Yeun). Jake Gyllenhaal is the TV celebrity mixed up in the ensuing media frenzy. Streaming on Netflix.\n>Snowpiercer (2013). Survivors of a climate-engineering disaster hurtle through a frigid future inside a train, where a revolutionary (Chris Evans) tries to disrupt the rigid class hierarchy that exists on board. With Swinton, Ed Harris, and John Hurt. Streaming on Netflix.\n>Mother (2009). An extremely twisted tale of a mother (Kim Hye-ja) who will do anything for her son, and a son (Won Bin) who will do anything for mom. As we see in the director's other films, family can be murder. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Vudu, and YouTube.\n>TheHost(2006). Chemicals dumped into a river produce a ravenous creature that preys upon local residents. A street vendor (Song Kang-ho) fights back when the thing abducts his daughter (Ko Ah-sung). A repertory classic that often turns up in midnight screenings and horror festivals. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and You-Tube.\n>Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000). Residents of an apartment complex turn on each other when one man's irritation at a noisy dog leads to a sequence of retaliation and retribution. You can rent or buy on Amazon Apple, FandangoNow, and Vudu. gthompson@inquirer.com"}, {"text": "Nov 18, 2019( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  This story first appeared in the Race Begins issue of TheWrap's Oscar magazine. Bong Joon Ho didn't know what was going to happen in 'Parasite,' either. Long before his darkly comic, deliciously twisted look at class divisions thrilled audiences and critics in Cannes and beyond, before the bends in its genre-hopping narrative befuddled and delighted adventurous moviegoers, the writer-director himself wondered where the hell this story was going. 'I let this idea develop for around four years in my head, since 2013,' Bong said. \n'But the second half of the film, all of that came in the last three months of my screenwriting process. The idea of a poor family infiltrating a rich house one by one was there since 2013, but I had many versions of the ending, and I didn't know what was going to happen. 'It all came flooding out in the last three months, like I was yanking a potato out of the earth. It was a very exciting feeling.' Before that, he added with a laugh, he did know that the film wouldn't have a conventional conclusion. 'I had a feeling that it would become a very strange story,' he said. 'I knew it would not be a normal ending.' Also Read: 'Parasite' Film Review: Bong Joon-ho Tackles Disparity With Delicious Dark Comedy[1]     And now Bong Joon Ho has the chance to experience an extraordinary ending with his film \u2014 not on screen, but off. After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, receiving near-unanimous critical acclaim and earning $14.4 million in its first six weeks of limited release, 'Parasite' seems likely to become the first Korean film ever to be nominated in the Best International Feature Film category (formerly Best Foreign Language Film). But beyond that, it has attracted such passionate fans that it's clearly in the running for Best Picture and Best Director nominations, which would place it in the rare company of such notable films as Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's 'Roma,' Michael Haneke's 'Amour' and Costa-Gavras' 'Z.' 'No one knows what will happen, but I am looking forward to it,' Bong said of the prospects of Oscar recognition. 'Korean cinema is celebrating its 100-year anniversary, and at one time Korean films were relatively less known in the international community compared to Japanese, Chinese and Hong Kong films. It was really in the 2000s when Korea became one of the most robust film industries in Asia. So if 'Parasite' were to be nominated, it would mean a lot for the whole Korean film industry, and give people the opportunity to reflect on the history of Korean cinema.' But 'Parasite' is no history lesson. Brash and freewheeling, with tonal shifts, forays into genre and a steadily increasing amount of craziness, it's a thrill ride that takes unexpected turns but also happens to be a trenchant examination of the gulf between rich and poor. 'I always felt like I wanted to be a step ahead of the audience,' said Bong, who acquired a reputation for skillful genre exercises with Korean films 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' before making the English-language films 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja.' 'When they're not prepared to have something explode, I would have something explode in the story. And when the audience is anxious and expecting something to happen, I would delay that moment so they would become more and more anxious. I really had to go beyond the audience's expectations in terms of where the story will go.' That story starts in the squalid basement dwelling of the Kim family, a quartet of seemingly lovable losers who get a boost when son Ki-woo lies his way into a job tutoring the teenage daughter of a rich couple, the Parks. In short order, the rest of the family worms their way into jobs with the Parks; it's a great arrangement for them, until it isn't. 'The initial concept for the story was the sense of infiltration,' said the writer-director routinely referred to as 'Director Bong.' 'When you work, you rarely have the opportunity to enter the private realm of somebody's life \u2014 but with jobs like tutoring, driving or housekeeping, you have no choice but to infiltrate their lives.' He drew from his own days tutoring a rich teenager, though you can only learn so much from a job if you get fired after two months, as Bong was. Also Read: 'Parasite' Sets New Record for Director Bong Joon-Ho at Indie Box Office[2]    The film's setup puts rich and poor characters in close proximity, which had also been a characteristic of 'Snowpiercer.' Asked if he's particularly drawn to the subject in these times of vast income disparity, he shrugged. 'You know, 'Snowpiercer' is from a French graphic novel which was created in the middle of the 1980s,' Bong said in English, before characteristically slipping into Korean midway through his answer. (Obviously, the Korean sections of his answers are translated for this story.) 'But that subject still works,' Bong said, citing recent works like Hirokazu Kore-eda's 'Shoplifters' and Jordan Peele's 'Us.' 'There is a commonality among all those films,' he said. 'It's not just me \u2014 I think a lot of creators are interested in that issue. It's something that's around us in our daily lives, and it's very close to the times that we live in \u2014 this idea of capitalism, and the gap between rich and poor.' He paused, and then returned to English for a couple of sentences. 'But a filmmaker like Ken Loach, he has already been dealing with that subject matter for a long time. I really admire him, but I haven't latched onto the issue like he did. It's not something that I plan to persistently pursue throughout my career. I consider myself primarily a genre filmmaker. I really pursue the entertainment that comes from genre, the excitement that it brings. And through those elements, I try to explore these issues.' The approach can be risky: Balancing black comedy with social drama and moments of horror takes a deft hand to keep things from sliding into messiness and tonal chaos. But the director thinks he's figured out how to do it with the help of two main factors. 'The first is the actors I work with,' he said. 'All the actors in 'Parasite,' they always retain a very realistic tone to their performances. It's never extreme, it's never fitted to the genre framework. They always show very realistic emotions. So even when the image and atmosphere of my film changes, they always maintain that realistic tone. And I think that's why the film ends up being so coherent, even when the genre atmosphere changes.' Song Kang-ho, who has acted for Bong several times and plays the father in 'Parasite,' said those tonal shifts were what concerned him the most about his work in the film. 'I thought, 'How am I going to control the transition from one genre to the next in the same movie?'' he said. 'That really kept me awake.' The second way he balanced different genres, Bong added, is by not fully committing to any one of them. 'In any one particular scene or sequence, even if it's funny, it's never 100% slapstick comedy,' he said. 'It's funny, but there's always a layer of anxiety underneath. People feel guilty about laughing, they wonder if they should even be laughing. There are already multiple layers of emotions in one scene. So even if the surface layer changes throughout, because everything is so layered and there is always an underlying current, everything connects.' Also Read: Oscars International Race 2019: Complete List of Films[3]     But walking that line between laughter and guilt isn't the only way Bong is teasing his audience. The Kim family automatically gets our sympathy at the beginning of the film: They're poor, they live in a pit (literally), they're doing their best and they're played by tremendously appealing actors, Bong veteran Song Kang-ho foremost among them. But as much as we like them, we also find ourselves coming to terms with the fact that they do horrible things to improve their fortunes. 'They are doing very bad things!' Bong agreed with a laugh. 'But it's actually very complicated and subtle. Because of the very particular charm that these actors have and the very human emotions that they portray, we as an audience end up rooting for them and we wish for their con to succeed. I think that's the dangerous charm that these actors have and that cinema has. 'But even with the rich family, they're not your conventional greedy assholes. It's not as if they're corrupt or embezzling or anything like that. So overall in this film you have no clear villains. You can have suspicion of all the characters while feeling a lot of affection for them. And that's how I felt as a filmmaker as I was shooting this film, too.' Park So-dam, who auditioned for 'Okja' but was too old for the part of the little girl in that film (she's now 28), was thrilled to land her role as the scheming daughter. 'Every moment working with him is exciting and sometimes gives me butterflies in my stomach,' she said. 'In a good way.' Bong is now working on two films, both of which are in the early stages; one is in English and the other in Korean, and they're both relatively low budget. ('Parasite' cost a little more than $10 million and he says the next two will be comparable in budget.) Given the Oscar buzz and the amount of time he's spending in the U.S. this awards season, a Hollywood movie or two would hardly be surprising \u2014 but to hear him tell it, he has no real desire to be that predictable. ''Snowpiercer' was my first English-language film, but it's not as if I intended to create a film in English,' he said. 'The original French graphic novel demanded an international cast and the story demanded that it be in English. It's not that I intend to emigrate to L.A. and continue making only English films, or stay in Korea and only make Korean films. I will just follow the ideas and materials that I'm attracted to at the time, and it's always a very natural process.' And while he does have a 'great' American agent who sends him 'really amazing' scripts, the guy just can't bring himself to be a gun for hire. 'It's a personal issue,' he said. 'As a writer and director, I can't help but be more attracted to scripts where I write everything from start to finish. I admire professional film directors who can direct scripts written by other people, and I wish I could do it. But it doesn't work out that well for me.' Below, Bong shares some of the storyboards he used to shoot 'Parasite,' compiled in the book 'Parasite: The Screenplay and Storyboard Book,' which was published in South Korea in October. 'I storyboard everything, and I do it myself,' Bong said of his process. 'I draw it on my iPad and put it on iCloud.' He paused and laughed. 'I don't know why I put in all the effort to draw this when I could hire someone to do it for me.'

Each of them is built atop a bedrock of comic violence that Bong uses to support the weight of the heavy stories he places on top of it, but simply categorizing 'Snowpiercer' as science-fiction or 'Memories of Murder' as a mystery would require you to ignore the rare magic that holds them together, and deny the controlled instability that allows them to keep changing shape before your eyes. The director refers to his furious and fiendishly well-crafted new film as a 'family tragicomedy,' but the best thing about 'Parasite[2]' is that it gives us permission to stop trying to sort his movies into any sort of pre-existing taxonomy \u2014 with 'Parasite,' Bong finally becomes a genre unto himself. Ditching the sci-fi elements that have defined his recent work in favor of a more grounded (but no less eccentric) story of life under the pall of late capitalism, Bong's latest offers another compassionate parable about how society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people. \nThe difference with this tender shiv of a movie is that it doesn't rely on its metaphors, or even let them survive; on the contrary, it attacks them with a wide variety of household objects until it becomes clear just how possible all of 'Parasite' really is. As heightened as 'Okja,' but as realistic as 'Mother,' it proves once and for all that with Bong Joon-ho \u2014 as with the hyper-stratified systems that he invariably depicts \u2014 the more things change, the more they stay the same. And the more his films transform \u2014 over the course of an act, a scene, or sometimes even a single shot \u2014 the more holistic they become. Play Video[3]'Parasite' begins with its most nakedly relatable moment of leeching, as the members of a poor Seoul family scurry around their squalid, basement-level apartment looking for a few bars of free wi-fi. It seems like one of the local businesses, sick of having their network slowed down by a bunch of freeloaders, finally got around to installing a password. So it goes. 'Hold your phones high!' yells good-natured patriarch Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), as if he hasn't been rendered obsolete because of his complete lack of technological know-how. But his college-age son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam) both dutifully heed their father's advice, because their dad has been around the block a few times and they respect his life experience. Chung-soon (Chang Hyae-jin), Ki-taek's wife, focuses the brunt of her energy on folding the massive stacks of flat pizza boxes that are piled in their grimy kitchen \u2014 the pittance a local restaurant pays them for that service has become the family's only source of outcome. But, as with all of the protagonists in Bong's films, these people are smart and proud and resourceful; in a nod to Bae Doo-na's character from 'The Host,' Chung-soon even has an impressive background in esoteric sports. The problem is that they've been screwed by a system that doesn't have any mercy for those who slip down the ladder, and now they live in a cement box with no door. So when Ki-jung's handsome, higher-class friend moves to America and asks him to take over his job tutoring the teenage daughter of a nouveau riche businessman, the underqualified Ki-jung jumps at the chance. His artful sister forges up some documents, and the next thing he knows he's standing in the foyer of a spacious granite mansion somewhere in the hills above the city. The place \u2014 a marvel of set design that Bong's team constructed with all the care with which he writes his characters \u2014 is a sleek masterpiece of smooth rock and clear glass; it's wide open, but it also harbors plenty of great hiding spots. It's a fine home for the obliviously affluent Park family, even if the sweet but daffy Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) and her longtime housekeeper (Lee Jung-eun) are the only ones there to look after the kids. And both of them definitely need looking after. Da-hye (Jung Ziso) is a horny student who treats her tutors as indentured make-out partners, while little Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) is a hyper-active kid with some real trauma and a nascent artistic streak that his mom likens to Basquiat with a straight face; 'Parasite,' like all of Bong's films, is laugh-out-loud funny until the moment it's not. Lucky for the Park family, Ki-woo happens to be related to someone who could look the part of an art teacher \u2014 of course, he and his sister pretend not to know each other when she shows up for her interview. It isn't long before Ki-jung schemes to have Mr. Park's driver fired, creating another open position. The housekeeper is the only obstacle left at that point; once Chung-sook has replaced her, one family will have completely latched onto another and feeding off their financial assistance (as well as the food in their well-stocked refrigerator full of Voss water, which might be life's most succinct expression of empty wealth). One family lives above the hills, and the other lives below a flood zone; if 'Snowpiercer' was a socioeconomic hierarchy knocked sideways, 'Parasite' stacks the classes up again in a way that stretches from the sewers to the sky, and all sorts of hidden pockets in between. This movie doesn't hinge on major plot twists, per se, but the cleverness of its structure only takes shape as one clan gets more comfortable living off another, and the top and bottom rungs of the financial ladder start meeting in the same place. Thanks to cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, whose camera juts through the Park home like the bones of a skeleton, Bong's reliably clever and multi-plane compositions make that house feel like the blueprints of a world that's diced up by an invisible social contract. When Mr. Park heaps praise on his new driver for not 'crossing the line,' you can almost see the divide he's talking about. Few movies have so viscerally traced how certain jobs cause the rift between tax brackets to collapse. Ki-woo and his family share a space with the Parks, but they occupy a different reality; they (and their film) spend most of their time in that mansion, but you can feel them navigating around their employers' lives with surgical precision. Of course, cut deep enough, and those careful boundaries start to bleed. This being a Bong Joon-ho movie, that blood eventually comes out in huge splashes, and it seeps into some very unexpected places. Giddy one moment, unbearably tense the next, and always so entertaining and fine-tuned that you don't even notice when it's changing gears, 'Parasite' takes all of the beats you expect to find in a Bong film and shrinks them down with clockwork precision. The movie doesn't feel smaller than the globe-trotting 'Okja,' only more constricted. It's a magic trick that Bong is able to pull off because he's able to carve an entire breathless setpiece from a single wooden table. There's nothing in 'Parasite' as epic as the opening attack in 'The Host,' but the film contains a number of inspired sequences that pulse with the same, chaotic, morally relative madness of Bong's signature moments; one is underwater, one is on stone, one is on grass. Exciting as they are, all of them produce a heart-in-your-throat queasiness that comes with not knowing who deserves to survive. Bong has a profound empathy for Ki-woo's family, but his plot hinges on the damage their economic aspirations have on the people they displace; in order to move up in this world, someone else has to be brought down. Likewise, the Park family is never portrayed as explicitly 'bad,' even if their money has made them a little dumb and desensitized. Eschewing didacticism, 'Parasite' takes the complicated feelings that indentured workers have for their employers and conducts it into a veritable symphony of respect and contempt. It's not sustainable, but when it all breaks down it can just start over at the top of the cycle \u2014 the more things change, the more they stay the same. There's a reason why Bong's films usually end by restoring some version of the status quo, albeit with a hole in the middle (think of Song Kang-ho and his adopted son on the ice in 'The Host'). By the same token, there's a reason why 'Parasite' feels like his most crestfallen movie to date, and also his angriest. If the third act becomes a touch anticlimactic for how fast Bong stitches up some fresh wounds in order to race towards his ending, that feeling is redeemed by a massively powerful last shot that puts all of the director's work in perspective. Unlike his previous movies, which all had more readily available precedents, the hyper-kinetic anguish here only relates back to his previous movies. It clarifies a shared dream of co-existence, and the closer his characters come to making that dream a reality, the more devastating it is when everything goes off the rails or crashes down on itself. As cute as it is that the title of 'Parasite' offers a winking response to 'The Host,' it's impossible to imagine that Bong will ever have reason to make a movie called 'Symbiosis.' The impotent rage he feels about that spills into every frame of this incredible film, and leaves us all a little richer as a result.Grade: A-'Parasite' premiered in Competition at the 2019 Cannes[4] Film Festival.

We've gone from chunky VCR tapes to CDs to Blu Ray and now OTT, where a click of a button transports you into a bottomless cinematic universe. And that's just in case of the movies. And along with that, we also witnessed the first-ever non-English language film going on to win the Oscar for Best Picture.\nWhen Bong Joon Ho's Parasite made history\n. Now, true blue Joon Ho fans will tell you that Parasite is no Memories Of A Murder. And while that debate may rage on, it doesn't take away from the fact that Parasite opened up a door into a new world for non-English cinema. And by extension,\nfor Jallikattu, the Malayalam masterpiece and India's official entry into the 93rd Academy Awards\nin the Best International Feature Film category.\nWatch the trailer of Parasite here:\nFREEING THE OSCARS \nThe Oscars aren't like the Emmys where there's a separate event altogether for non-American content. The Oscars invites entries in all languages and essentially rewards excellence in cinema. Yet until 2020, this cinema needed to be in English, with non-English content being restricted to Foreign Language Film or International Feature Film categories. Parasite was also nominated for the same, and it won the same too. And then it went on to win Best Picture as well,\nthus finally breaking the language barrier\n. Now, art is language in itself, as it should.\nHere's the trailer of Jallikattu:\nSTORIES THAT TRANSCEND BORDERS \nParasite wasn't dubbed. It had subtitles, and that was enough to convey a story about class divide in South Korea to a world audience. The simple reason it managed to do that is because while being intrinsic to the South Korean societal structure, a story of haves and have-nots transcends borders. It is true for India just as much as it is true for Argentina. When the Kims and the Parks, two families on two opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum, clashed, we got it and we didn't need elaborate language to convey it to us. The powerful screenplay - which Parasite won another Oscar for, by the way - was enough. And Parasite could very easily have been a story about India - a Dharavi jhopdi versus the bungalows of Altamount Road. Jallikattu, on the other hand, is an allegorical story about a bull raging and rampaging through a village in Kerala as the villagers try to capture it. But it's beyond just that. In Jallikattu, it is the man who is the beast, and the bull is more human than humans today are capable of being. The name does ring a bell - the traditional event, a sport of sorts intrinsic to Tamil Nadu, but that's only a metaphor. If animal cruelty is at the centre of Jallikattu, can a viewer in Spain or Mexico not be able to understand it? With or without dubbing?\nA NEW HOPE\nYes, there's a long way to go for Jallikattu. First, it needs to make the shortlist and bag a nomination at the 93rd Academy Awards. But Parasite's win last year gives one hope. That once you cross that shortlist checkpoint, the world could be yours. Even if this year Jallikattu doesn't make it, Parasite has managed to inspire filmmakers from across the globe, telling stories about their countries, in their own way, that the erstwhile elusive Oscar trophy isn't so elusive anymore. We're, after all, global citizens, one film at a time. Shrunken onto a mobile screen now.\nALSO READ | Parasite Movie Review: Bong Joon Ho film is like poetry\nALSO READ | How Parasite, a non-English film, made history at Oscars 2020\nALSO READ | Why Lijo Jose's Jallikattu deserves to be India's Oscars 2021 entry: An overview\nALSO READ | Malayalam film Jallikattu is India's official entry to Oscars 2021\nLink to Image\n\u2028Graphic\n\n\n\n \nWhy Best Picture Oscar for Parasite means hope for India's Jallikattu"}, {"text": "Bong Joon-ho, the sui generis South Korean auteur behind unclassifiable modern wonders like \"Barking Dogs Never Bite\" and \"The Host,\" has always made films that refuse to fit the narrow parameters of any particular genre. Each of them is built atop a bedrock of comic violence that Bong uses to support the weight of the heavy stories he places on top of it, but simply categorizing \"Snowpiercer\" as science-fiction or \"Memories of Murder\" as a mystery would require you to ignore the rare magic that holds them together, and deny the controlled instability that allows them to keep changing shape before your eyes.\nThe director refers to his furious and fiendishly well-crafted new film as a \"family tragicomedy,\" but the best thing about \"Parasite\" is that it gives us permission to stop trying to sort his movies into any sort of pre-existing taxonomy - with \"Parasite,\" Bong finally becomes a genre unto himself. Ditching the sci-fi elements that have defined his recent work in favor of a more grounded (but no less eccentric) story of life under the pall of late capitalism, Bong's latest offers another compassionate parable about how society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people.\nThe difference with this tender shiv of a movie is that it doesn't rely on its metaphors, or even let them survive; on the contrary, it attacks them with a wide variety of household objects until it becomes clear just how possible all of \"Parasite\" really is. As heightened as \"Okja,\" but as realistic as \"Mother,\" it proves once and for all that with Bong Joon-ho - as with the hyper-stratified systems that he invariably depicts - the more things change, the more they stay the same. And the more his films transform - over the course of an act, a scene, or sometimes even a single shot - the more holistic they become.\n?\n\"Parasite\" begins with its most nakedly relatable moment of leeching, as the members of a poor Seoul family scurry around their squalid, basement-level apartment looking for a few bars of free wi-fi. It seems like one of the local businesses, sick of having their network slowed down by a bunch of freeloaders, finally got around to installing a password. So it goes. \"Hold your phones high!\" yells good-natured patriarch Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), as if he hasn't been rendered obsolete because of his complete lack of technological know-how. But his college-age son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam) both dutifully heed their father's advice, because their dad has been around the block a few times and they respect his life experience. Chung-soon (Chang Hyae-jin), Ki-taek's wife, focuses the brunt of her energy on folding the massive stacks of flat pizza boxes that are piled in their grimy kitchen - the pittance a local restaurant pays them for that service has become the family's only source of outcome.\nBut, as with all of the protagonists in Bong's films, these people are smart and proud and resourceful; in a nod to Bae Doo-na's character from \"The Host,\" Chung-soon even has an impressive background in esoteric sports. The problem is that they've been screwed by a system that doesn't have any mercy for those who slip down the ladder, and now they live in a cement box with no door. So when Ki-jung's handsome, higher-class friend moves to America and asks him to take over his job tutoring the teenage daughter of a nouveau riche businessman, the underqualified Ki-jung jumps at the chance.\nHis artful sister forges up some documents, and the next thing he knows he's standing in the foyer of a spacious granite mansion somewhere in the hills above the city. The place - a marvel of set design that Bong's team constructed with all the care with which he writes his characters - is a sleek masterpiece of smooth rock and clear glass; it's wide open, but it also harbors plenty of great hiding spots. It's a fine home for the obliviously affluent Park family, even if the sweet but daffy Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) and her longtime housekeeper (Lee Jung-eun) are the only ones there to look after the kids. And both of them definitely need looking after.

I don't remember how old I was, but it was probably in high school when a buddy and I watched \"Oldboy\" for the first time. I was blown away. I had forgotten just how wide the spectrum of emotions a movie can make you feel was, and it felt like I was falling in love with movies all over again.\nThe second time I was exposed to Korean films, a similar feeling was elicited from me when I watched \"Train to Busan.\" At that point, Korean movies were batting a thousand. Then, \"Snowpiercer\" came along - a movie I instantly fell in love with that I didn't originally realize was a Korean movie because it was in English and had many big-name western stars in it. Eventually, I learned that \"Snowpiercer\" was directed by Bong Joon-Ho, one of the most talented directors/writers in South Korea and, therefore, the world. He's made a lot of really well-received movies in South Korea but only a few like \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja\" ever managed to gain some buzz in the states.\nEvery South Korean movie I'd ever seen was awesome, and as a result of that, I was incredibly excited to check out Bong's latest film, \"Parasite.\" I won't mince words; \"Parasite\" is the best film of 2019 that I've seen so far (although I admit I have not seen \"The Lighthouse\" yet), and anybody who either speaks Korean or can read English subtitles should see this movie as soon as possible.\n\"Parasite\" is a story about two families - the Kims and the Parks. The Kim family is down on their luck. They're all unemployed and, despite how hard they try, they can't seem to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and escape their situation. One day, a friend of Kim Ki-Woo, the oldest son (portrayed by Woo-sik Choi), puts Ki-Woo in touch with a rich family in need of a tutor, the Parks. He accepts. From there, shenanigans and some stuff that I wouldn't describe as shenanigans ensue. I won't explain anymore because I thoroughly enjoyed, going into this movie, knowing absolutely nothing about the plot and I highly recommend you do as well; the originality of the plot is an essential part of the experience of watching \"Parasite.\" It reminded me a lot of \"Get Out\" at first, because \"Parasite\" is the first film since \"Get Out\" that thoroughly intrigued me because of how unique its story and storytelling is.\nWhere \"Get Out\" was a thriller with a powerful message about race, \"Parasite\" is a thriller with a powerful message about class, and not a ham-fisted one at that either. If you've seen any of Bong's movies, you'll know that they're often centered around a critique of capitalism - and the class struggle that comes with it. \"Parasite\" is his most nuanced and successful critique of capitalism and a lot of that is in the directing, but mostly in the writing and performances.\nOne scene that really struck me showed the Kim family hiding under a table while Mr. and Mrs. Park lay on their couch snuggling. Mr. Park, unaware of Mr. Kim's presence, talks about Mr. Kim, who is in his employment as a driver, and how he's good at his job but smells like an old radish. Mr. Kim hears all of this, and we can see that this visibly upsets him. From his facial twitches alone, we get a sense for how deep a sense of shame it brings him that he stinks and can't help it because of how poor he is, and how embarrassed it made him feel to have his children hear this, too.\nAnother poignant scene that comes soon after showcases how the two families react to a heavy rainstorm, with the Parks being able to sit inside their warm, peaceful, above-ground house and enjoy the rain. Meanwhile, the Kims' area of town is flooded, leading them to frantically do whatever they can to preserve what items of value could be found in the semi-basement apartment they live in.\nThe movie doesn't portray the rich as evil or the poor as lazy - it's not that simple. The realistic depiction of the class struggle is enough to shake whatever notions of financial stability you may have thought you had before - the two families live in entirely different worlds, and yet, the only thing inherently different about them is how much money one of them has. However, the film shows that the barrier between classes is great enough that there is nothing the poor can do to escape their predicament other than fight one another for the scraps of the rich.\nThe directing is phenomenal: Joon-Ho did an absolutely fantastic job, and I'm not surprised at all. There are so many shots in this film where the way they're framed can really only be described as art. This movie was so incredibly aesthetically pleasing that my brain thought it was watching ASMR soap-cutting videos for two hours. The cinematography wasn't just pretty though; it was also purposeful. The ways characters were blocked alone delivered more information to the audience than the entire scripts of most movies this year. For instance, one scene that caught my attention showed Ki-Woo's sister Kim Ki-Jung (portrayed by Park So-Dam) sitting on the toilet seat of her flooded apartment, dejectedly smoking a cigarette while watching the waters rise higher and higher. This scene subtly showing her isolation and despair is a stark contrast to most other scenes featuring the Kim family - they are usually close together like sardines in their tiny apartment - showing both their poverty and their solidarity. This is yet another distinction from the Park family, who are always splayed about in their spacious home. Joon-Ho displays a near-complete mastery of the craft, and I could feel the passion he instilled into the movie in every little detail.\nI thought all the performances were great, and that's all I'm really prepared to say about that. The Kim family patriarch, played by Kang-Ho Song, was especially good. Song managed to balance the stereotypical stoic patriarchal character with enough comedic tinge so that I never knew what would happen next - would he make me laugh, or would he shock me? I was told by someone from Korea that he's like the Korean equivalent of Robert DeNiro, so I guess it should probably go without saying that he's pretty good.\nThe one problem I have with the movie is that it was a little slow around the start of the second half. It had a really enjoyable momentum up until that part, but with a runtime of two hours and 12 minutes, I felt like there were parts in the second half that could have been edited out or condensed. The ending is explosive though - which more than makes up for the lull - but the lull is still there.\n\"Parasite\" is a great movie. It has a strong message, a smart script, beautiful visuals and great performances. I have not seen a movie like it in a long time, and that's a shame, because it's movies like \"Parasite\" that make me love film. Korean movies have never let me down, and if this movie is your first foray into the genre, you will leave very happy."}, {"text": "Parasite made history at Oscars this year.

When Bong Joon Ho finished a mid-October interview and photo shoot for the cover of TheWrap's first print issue this season, he stopped on his way out of the office to meet our film team. As one-by-one they told him how much they'd loved his film #8216;Parasite,#8217; Bong broke into a sheepish grin. #8216;This is getting embarrassing,#8217; he said. \nIn the three months since then, it's safe to say that Bong Joon Ho has had plenty more embarrassing moments. He and his wickedly twisted black comedy have been the hit of the awards circuit, with the director and his actors picking up famous fans from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio to Guillermo del Toro, who hosted a starry party for the film in early January. #8216;I tend to get shy easily,#8217; Bong said through a translator a few hours after his film landed six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. #8216;Even last night at the Critics' Choice Awards, we sat next to the #8216;Joker' table, and Todd Phillips came over and said he saw #8216;Parasite' three times and felt so many things watching the movie. I could feel my face flush and turn red, I was so embarrassed. #8216;And whenever that happens, I just try to introduce other people.

But I don't think it's ever easy to figure out the reason behind success. #8216;A lot of people say that it's a story about rich and poor, so it can easily resonate and is universal.

His latest film, a darkly comic thriller set in Seoul\u2019s social hierarchy, might require us to steady our dwindling attention spans and read along with the story, but it\u2019s definitely worth the effort \u2013 Parasite is nothing short of a masterpiece. \nIt begins with the Kim family, folding pizza boxes to scrape a living in their bug-infested basement home in the South Korean capital. Their dirty window is level with the street and they can just about log into someone else\u2019s wi-fi. For our protagonists, there are tiny glimmers of hope and life above ground that are kept anchored by being able to see people literally pissing on your house or having to crouch on a ledge over the toilet to get a phone signal. \nThe Kims might not have much but you get the sense that they\u2019re content with that. They find the positive in situations most would find annoying \u2013 when a blast of fumigation seeps through their open windows from the street dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) cheerily suggests they don\u2019t close them but make the most of some free insecticide. But their fortunes begin to change when an old friend visits son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), bringing with him a scholar\u2019s rock that is supposed to bring wealth \u2013 and an offer to take over his job as a private English tutor for a rich family. \nWith a college diploma falsified by his Photoshop wiz sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam), Ki-woo heads up \u2013 up the steep streets of Seoul and up the class system to its peak. In contrast to the Kims, the Parks are very rich, as exhibited by their spotless, spacious and modernist house with its manicured lawn and floor-to-ceiling windows. Matriarch Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) always seems on-edge, even though she has little to stress about \u2013 every menial task in her life is outsourced to staff \u2013 but her failure to do any background checks on the people she hires proves fatal later in the film. Bong Joon-ho\u2019s \u2018Parasite\u2019 has already racked up plenty of awards. Credit: Alamy\nOnce settled in his new job, Ki-woo concocts ways for the rest of his family to take up jobs in the Park residence, without revealing that any of them are related. Ki-jung poses as an unorthodox art therapist \u201cwith a special reputation in her field\u201d while, after some elaborate ruses see former employees fired, Ki-taek and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) nab roles as chauffeur and housekeeper respectively. All is going swimmingly for the Kims until they take over the luxurious home while the Parks are away on a camping trip, only to receive an unexpected visitor who reveals a big secret lurking in the depths of the house. \nFrom then on, it\u2019s not just Yeon-gyo who is on edge. The two factions of the working class we see in the film are embroiled in a very physical battle to rise above each other, feigning solidarity with the other before stabbing them in the back (or throwing them down the stairs). The Kims\u2019 comfortable new life is under threat and, as torrential rain hits Seoul and the sewers are flooded, they race down hills and city staircases to save their few belongings from the now underwater apartment shows just how far they have to fall. \nPart of the brilliance of Parasite is that, while this is an \u2018us vs them\u2019 story, it doesn\u2019t pick a side. Instead, Bong puts the flaws of both families on full display \u2013 each is as parasitical as the other, the Kims burrowing their way into the Parks\u2019 house under false pretences and the Parks subtly exploiting the Kims while making disparaging comments about them that give themselves a sense of superiority. \nA TV spin-off of Parasite was announced earlier this month that will explore some of the movie\u2019s \u201chidden stories\u201d. That\u2019s exactly the feeling Parasite will leave you with \u2013 no matter how many times you watch it (and it\u2019s a film that, as its title suggests, gets under your skin and makes you itch for another viewing), there are still so many more secrets hiding in the shadows. \n\u2022\tDirector: Bong Joon-ho\n\u2022\tStarring: Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo\n\u2022\tRelease date:\u00a07 February 2020\nThe post \u2018Parasite\u2019 review: Bong Joon-ho\u2019s darkly comic thriller is a modern masterpiece (yes, even with subtitles) appeared first on       \u00a0    NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM."}, {"text": "May 21, 2019( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Cannes has always offered a home to both audacious genre filmmaking and politically engaged, social issue cinema but it's usually been an either/or proposition. Festival juries, meanwhile, have tended to celebrate one at the expense of the other. While Quentin Tarantino's 2004 jury paid honor to both offerings \u2014 awarding Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' the Grand Prize and Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' the Palme d'Or - most have signaled a marked preference for politically liberal, if formally conservative works like Ken Loach's 'I, Daniel Blake' in lieu of more outr offerings. \nSo it will be particularly interesting to see what this year's Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu-led bunch makes of Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite,' a genre-bending dark comedy with searing class consciousness that premiered in Cannes on Tuesday. Also Read: 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' Film Review: A Contemplative Quentin Tarantino Still Blows the Roof Off Cannes[1] Coming back to full-on Korean language filmmaking after his less-than-wholly satisfying Hollywood dalliances 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja,' Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture, which takes bold leaps between tenors and tone, but holds together beautifully thanks to the director's unparalleled visual/spatial sophistication, and his unsparing social indictment. In a note handed out to the press, Bong asked that we not reveal too much of the film's twisting plot, so let's just say it follows two families on opposite sides of the social/financial totem pole and tracks their growing interdependence with devious curiosity. Bong's actor of choice, Song Kang-ho ('The Host,' 'Memories of Murder'), once again takes leading man duties, playing Ki-taek, paterfamilias to a downwardly mobile family of four. When his son lands a plum gig as an academic tutor for a wealthy family, Ki-taek spots a nugget of opportunity for his entire clan, setting into motion a series of series of events that will cycle through scenes of dark comedy, shocking violence and baroquely orchestrated suspense. Also Read: Cannes Report, Day 7: Big Deal for Terrence Malick, Isabelle Huppert Dazzles in 'Frankie'[2] As the film's pitch oscillates between registers, its setting remains fixed, with almost all of the action limited to the wealthy family's sprawling estate. The house's wood paneling and open spaces offer the filmmaker an architecturally modernist playground that he exploits to great effect, most notably by creating spatial contrasts with the poorer family's cramped slum quarters. Indeed, in tracing the ocean of disparity between the two clans, 'Parasite' feels very much in concert with last year's Palme d'Or winner, 'Shoplifters,' and this year's contender, 'Sorry We Missed You.' Though the film operates along certain thriller codes and actively seeks to entertain, it has no less fiery political charge than either of those aforementioned films \u2014 and that's what makes it such a fascinating challenge with the entrenched sensibilities that have marked Cannes for so long. There is this sense that a filmmaker can only explore pernicious social issues with stylistic sobriety, and Bong is having none of that. His is a style drunk on the joys of cinema, full of fluid camera work, polished images and belly laughs. He's unafraid to take big swings in every which direction, and because he's such a skilled director, those swings almost always connect. An ambitious and delightfully accomplished work, 'Parasite' makes good on the Cannes Film Festival's promise to present the finest of world cinema. Whether this year's jury agrees, on the other, remains to be seen.Related stories from TheWrap: Cannes Struggles for Relevance in Shrinking Movie Business[3]New Database to Hire Women in Film Launches at Cannes[4]Cannes at the Halfway Point: How Did Elton John Become King of the Fest?[5] [ 1]: https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-film-review-a-contemplative-quentin-tarantino-still-blows-the-roof-off-cannes/ [ 2]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/cannes-report-day-7-isabelle-huppert-dazzles-in-ira-sachs-frankie-dardennes-young-ahmed-divides/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/cannes-struggles-for-relevance-in-shrinking-movie-business/ [ 4]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/05/20/new-database-to-hire-women-in-film-launches-at-cannes/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/cannes-halfway-point-how-did-elton-john-become-king-of-the-fest/"}, {"text": "Every week, the film industry offers a fresh slap to the face.\nBetween the increasing dominance of mindless franchise product and the erosion of substantive films made for discerning audiences, it is difficult to feel hopeful about stepping into the dark of a cinema - as wondrous and transformative an experience as modern life affords.\nBut this past weekend, salvation reared its head in New York and Los Angeles, where a new film smashed box-office records.\nThe unlikely culprit: Parasite, a small-scale South Korean drama with no special effects to speak of and zero sequel or spinoff potential to tempt skeptical audiences.\nThanks to audience word-ofmouth and rapturous reviews culled from the film-festival circuit, Parasite earned an average of more than US$128,000 in each of the three theatres it screened, an unheard of figure for a foreignlanguage film, especially one unable to boast a high-concept narrative or internationally renowned star.\nParasite does, however, have one semi-known quantity to boast of: writer and director Bong Joon-ho. Art-house-attuned moviegoers will recognize the name from his early Seoul-based dramas Mother and Memories of Murder, while anyone with a Netflix subscription will recall his genrecrossing satire Okja, or perhaps his politically charged sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer. But for anyone not yet familiar with Bong, Parasite is ready and eager to infect your consciousness and soul, quickly turning you into an eager host for all things Bong.\nFollowing the messy intersection of two modern Seoul families - one clan destitute and scheming for a better life, the other perched comfortably and ignorantly at the upper crust of society - Parasite is exhilarating, thrilling, furious and deeply upsetting. It is also, and here's where things get tricky, extraordinarily surprising, with its story pivoting on a huge twist that arrives one-third through. All of which is to say: Bong hopes you see Parasite, before Parasite becomes inescapable.\n\"Thankfully, everyone has so far been really co-operative with keeping the spoilers to themselves. I've seen families eating out in Seoul, talking about the film, but once they discover there are people among them who haven't seen it, they got up and left,\" says Bong, 50. \"People are really protective of this film.\"\nIt is the opening weekend of the Toronto International Film Festival, and Bong seems deeply exhausted. The director has been discussing - and, well, not discussing - the implications of Parasite's twist since this past May, when the film had its world premiere at Cannes, bowling over critics and capturing the film festival's coveted Palme d'Or. Somehow, as the film has since travelled to Telluride and Toronto (where it would go on to win second runner-up for TIFF's People's Choice Award), Parasite's big reveal has been preserved, a testament to either audiences' newfound ability to keep something special to themselves in an era of instant spoiler-y Twitter tidal waves, or the sheer power that the film carries. Likely both.\n\"The film has been released in several countries now, and I've begun to see people diving into it as if it were a game - discussing the details, the foreshadowing of the twist, the symbolism in the film,\" Bong says, \"but no one is spoiling it. Mostly everyone, at least in the Korean online community, are talking about poverty and their own experiences. And how it's actually worse than it seems in the movie.\"\nAnd Parasite makes life on South Korea's lower rung look absolutely awful. Bong introduces the Kim family - Parasite's quasiprotagonists - as sympathetic bottom-feeders, with the foursome occupying an overcrowded basement apartment where the toilet is faulty, the WiFi must be leeched from neighbouring businesses and the air is thick with either the scent of drunkards' urine or the debilitating fog of streetlevel fumigation. Patriarch Kim Ki-taek (Bong regular Song Kangho) is desperate and clever in equal measure, but cannot seem to imagine a world even one step higher. Until, that is, his son, Kiwoo (Choi Woo-sik), sneakily scores a tutoring job for the son of wealthy tech entrepreneur Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun). Over the course of about two hours, fortunes are changed, lives are upended, and the class tensions of South Korea - or anywhere in the world, really - are stretched till they snap.\n\"As Korea went through the Korean War and the military dictatorships, we've become a very developed and rich country,\" Bong explains. \"But despite the growth, the gap between the rich and the poor has only widened.\nAs the country over all seems wealthy and extravagant, there are still so many people who are saying, 'Why are we still struggling?' That sense of inferiority and loss, it's felt. And it's not just emotional, it's physical.\"\nIn typical Bong fashion - reminiscent of how Okja's zany corporate satire comes equipped with a too-bizarre-for-words Tilda Swinton, or how The Host's family melodrama is backgrounded by a good old-fashioned monster hunt - Parasite's central themes are delivered in a blessedly shocking manner. The Kim family's slow invasion of the Parks is tightly controlled dark comedy until Bong flips the story on its head to produce a shocking and sickening tragedy. As his film's title suggests - who is the real bloodsucker here, the Kims or the Parks? - Bong doesn't so much upend expectations as he dares you to forever abandon yours.\nThe film also marks a surprising, if perhaps inevitable, return for Bong to his home country. After spending the past half-decade working if not exactly in then explicitly for Hollywood with Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite finds Bong returning to a more familiar country and language.\n\"I tend to improvise a lot on set, so it's adjusting dialogue and suggesting new ideas, so it was great to not need a translator this time, and being able to have fun with my actors,\" Bong says. \"But a lot of the joy this time came from not coming back to Korea, but to coming back to films of this size and scale. Working on Parasite was like working on Mother or Memories of Murder. Smaller, controlled, comfortable.\"\nPart of the comfort comes from having actor Song Kang-ho around once again. Although the Korean star had a supporting role in Snowpiercer, the full weight of Parasite rests on Song's sizable shoulders - a task he carries with the dedication and commitment familiar to anyone who has seen him blaze the screen in such Korean hits as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Thirst. His Parasite patriarch, at once beaten down and invigorated by a world that wants nothing to do with him, is one of the more complex and memorable characters that audiences of any culture will encounter this year.\n\"It's not as if there's a special nerve on the back heel of Song's foot that's connected to my finger, but sometimes it does feel as if we have that connection,\" Bong says of his relationship with the actor.\n\"We don't talk a lot on set - we don't discuss the character for hours - but I think Song, as an actor, instinctively understands what I want to say with my script, and what we need to show with a particular scene. There's never been a time when I've disagreed with a decision in his performance.\"\nAs Parasite begins to creep further into North America - it opens in Toronto this Friday, before expanding into more Canadian theatres in November - Bong is faced with a sort of Bong-esque dilemma: Should he trust that the typical hopes for a film of his pedigree and provenance will prevail, i.e., that the film will get Academy Award attention in the Best International Film category? Or should he prepare for an upending of his own expectations, and find Parasite instead nominated in the mainstream Best Picture slot, alongside Hollywood's finest? In a tiny way, the film's fate is in his hands.\n\"Song and I have been members of the [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] for the past five years, now that the Academy is trying to increase the diversity of its membership. So this year, we talked about, 'Oh, should we vote for Parasite?' \" Bong says with a laugh. \"Is it embarrassing?\nIs it illegal? But anyway, it's a secret vote.\"\nAnd secrets are Bong's specialty. He'll keep his, so long as you keep Parasite's."}, {"text": "Sep 13, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Bong Joon-ho[1]'s 'Parasite[2]' won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May but still managed to be the talk of the fall film festivals despite competing against an onslaught of world premieres. Anyone at Telluride or TIFF[3] will tell you that the 'Parasite' screenings were some of the most attended and most raved about, leaving the family thriller with strong Oscar buzz ahead of its October theatrical release. 'Parasite' is so beloved that talks of an English-language remake[4] are already underway, but don't except Bong to personally take 'Parasite' to Hollywood. \nSpeaking to IndieWire's Anne Thompson at TIFF, Bong stressed that he remains somewhat resistant to taking on Hollywood studio offers. The only way Bong would join a major Hollywood studio is if he wrote the movie himself, which most likely takes him out of the running for a majority of Hollywood franchise films. Bong cited Quentin Tarantino as a filmmaker he is modeling his career after because his intention is to only direct scripts he writes himself. When Hollywood script offers have come knocking in the past, Bong has politely turned them all down. 'I received a lot of [Hollywood] offers after 'The Host' in 2006,' Bong said. 'Lots of science-fiction, horror, and action films. I was just like, 'Wow, a Hollywood script!' I didn't accept any of them. My agent is a very nice guy and they already know that I like to direct my own scripts like Quentin Tarantino. Sometimes I do get a little disappointed that he doesn't send me anything. He doesn't send me any scripts now knowing that I always write my own.' Bong has made English-language movies in the past with 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja,' both of which were original scripts (though 'Snowpiercer' was adapted from a French graphic novel) that were picked up for U.S. distribution by studios outside of the majors at the time. 'Snowpiercer' was bought by The Weinstein Company (which led to some much-publicized[5] release issues), while Bong's 'Okja' script caught the eye of Netflix and was produced by Plan B Entertainment. These would be the kinds of movies Bong is interested in making at a major Hollywood studio, but pre-existing franchise and tentpole scripts won't do the trick. Bong made history at Cannes this year as 'Parasite' is the first South Korean movie to win the Palme d'Or. If 'Parasite' earns an Oscar nomination for Best International Film (the new name for the Best Foreign Language Film category), then it will become the first South Korean film nominated in history. U.S. distributor Neon is hoping for more than just a Best International Film nomination and is set to campaign 'Parasite' for Best Picture, Best Director, and more. 'Roma' proved last year that foreign films can break out of the international category with the right acclaim and momentum ('Roma' was nominated for 10 Oscars), and that's certainly what Neon is hoping for 'Parasite' this awards season. 'Parasite' opens in U.S. theaters beginning October 11.

The family's eldest son Ki-woo (Choi) failed to make it into university, but what he lacks in book smarts, he makes up for in street smarts. He's a natural con artist and has the gift of gab. However, an opportunity soon falls into Ki-woo's lap in the form of a job recommendation. His best friend Min (Park Seo-joon) is traveling abroad and wants Ki-woo to take over tutoring one of his well-to-do teen students, Park Da-hye (Jung). Min-Hyuk has a romantic interest in the high-school sophomore Da-Hye, and basically wants Ki-woo to watch over her and keep away potential suitors while he's abroad. His master plan is to start dating Da-hye when she enters university. Min-Hyuk having trust in a scam artist like Ki-woo was probably the biggest mistake in his life. With the help of his sister Ki-jung's (Park So-dam) exceptional forgery skills, Ki-woo is easily able to manipulate himself into the rich, well-to-do Park household as the new English tutor for Da-hye. Da-hye's mother, Mrs. Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), is a flighty, snooty simp. She makes for an easy mark for the Kim family to assert themselves into the lives of the Park homestead.  After Ki-woo hatches a master plan, he's able to manipulate Ki-jung into the Park home as the art tutor for for the Park's youngest child, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Next up, the kids trick the Park family patriarch, (Lee Sun-kyun), to fire his driver and hire their dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). After that, it's the family housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun), who gets ousted and replaced by the Kim kids' mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). However, Ki-woo's carefully layered plan is nothing more than a house of cards, and a dark secret within the Park household threatens to shatter the Kim's ticket to money and luxury.  Parasite is a brilliantly shot movie. It's very much a product of its country of origin. As a result, it has a style that is both unique and refreshing compared to Hollywood films. It's darkly comedic, but it's not exactly an irreverent comedy. Other times, the film is darkly tragic and surprisingly poignant.  The lengths to which the Kim family goes to con and manipulate the Park family are both shocking and at times, borderline detestable. The one thing that keeps the Kim family from being outright unlikable is that there is still a true familial bond between them. The Kim family is made up down-and-out scoundrels, and yet, they still love, respect, and appreciate each other. Meanwhile, the white-collar Park family members are more self-obsessed with their status, image and wealth. If anything, it appears their wealth and status has made them soft and gullible. There doesn't appear to be any genuine love between them. It's evidence that while material wealthy might bring certain comforts and convenience, it doesn't bring true love or happiness. The Parks look down at others of a lower social standing.  This is a remarkable film about the rich vs. the poor and the dynamics therein. While the Parks are generally the protagonists of the story, they are not good people. One imagines if Ki-woo, who comes off as quite brilliant, would likely be better served investing those talents into more legitimate pursuits. His sister Ki-jung is equally brilliant and clearly a gifted graphic artist. It's bizarre these two couldn't apply themselves in school or make it into university. Perhaps that's either a flaw in the storytelling or a commentary on the South Korean academic system.  The performances in the main cast are impeccably performed. Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek really steals the show with some surprisingly dramatic and bittersweet moments. While Ki-woo is the basic protagonist of Parasite, Ki-taek is really the heart and soul of what this movie is about. The second and third act features plot twists that are both surprising and shockingly satisfying. They are twists the audience will not see coming, but they make complete and total sense. Those are the best kind of cinematic 'gotcha' moments. Bong Joon-ho and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo construct some beautiful imagery. The film is wonderfully shot. The shots are very straightforward, crisp and clear but contain all sorts of compelling imagery within them. The third act also features some quick, surprising, shocking bits of violence and gore that are rather Tarantino-esque. Parasite pulls no punches in terms of its visuals or narratives.  While many are throwing around the word masterpiece for this film, it might be premature to call it that. Bong Joon-ho has easily surpassed his previous work in Snowpiercer and created something that's both darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic, poignant and bittersweet all the at the same time. Parasite is a true cinematic experience[2] that will leave the audience with a lot to chew during the ride home.

The director's films have long been overlooked in the United States, despite the fact that his most recent two movies have been high-profile American coproductions (2013's \"Snowpiercer\" and 2017's \"Okja\"). But the hypothetical 10th Academy member would be completely unsurprised by the filmmaker's success, as Bong Joon-ho has been one of South Korea's most consistent directors, creating modern classics such as \"Mother\" and \"The Host\" for the better part of the last two decades.\nIn many ways, his journey reflects that of last year's Best Director-winner, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n - both filmmakers rose to prominence in their respective home countries, then found solid success in the United States working with American actors in English-language movies, before finally returning home to create their magnum opus in their native tongue. For Cuar\u00f3n, it was \"Roma,\" and now, for Bong, it's the incredible \"Parasite.\"\nBong's newest film has been met with universal critical acclaim, with many writers hailing it as the best movie of the year, and one of the best of the decade. \"Parasite\" is completely deserving of this praise, and yet, it's difficult to describe its greatness without spoiling essential elements of its plot. The film will be best enjoyed by viewing it with as little knowledge as possible - even assigning the film a genre could do it a disservice. Rest assured, though: the remainder of this review will attempt to praise \"Parasite\" without revealing any of the plot's specificities.\nThe greatest strength of \"Parasite\" is its airtight screenplay - it's complex, but never confusing. The script is so meticulously crafted that every line of dialogue is essential, and not a single second of screen time could be removed without damaging the overall cohesion of the film. Bong ensures that every detail is important, as he gracefully introduces each piece of the narrative's complex puzzle without ever making it obvious that he's doing so. Seemingly extraneous conversations and characters become unpredictably prominent, and the script's attention to detail will hugely reward repeat viewings.\nYet the screenplay's efficiency doesn't hinder its thematic substance or emotional complexity. \"Parasite\" explores the brokenness of society with incredible nuance - it thoroughly examines socioeconomic conflict without idolizing or villainizing any particular group, and points out social issues without overtly committing to partisan politics. Viewers can completely understand every character's actions, even if they're morally reprehensible, because they all make sense within each character's particular context. Because of this dynamic contextualization, \"Parasite\" lacks straightforward heroes and villains, and instead features numerous well-rounded characters whose understandable motivations bring them into conflict with one another.\nThe cinematography, set design, and editing work hand-in-hand to juxtapose different lifestyles and effortlessly put the viewers in each character's shoes. When a character struggles, the film utilizes tight framing, claustrophobic settings, and frenzied cuts to enhance the sense of anxiety, while calmer scenes employ wider shots, larger spaces, and longer takes to allow the characters and viewers to catch their breath.\n\"Parasite\" has two possible fates this awards season: it will either receive a plethora of nominations, or it will be the singular movie that everybody online complains about being snubbed. It's simultaneously a riveting social commentary and a thrilling piece of entertainment, and is universally accessible - while mature and occasionally graphic, any viewer of any age will be able to appreciate its quality.\n\u2022\ta&e\n\u2022\tarts\n\u2022\tarts & entertainment\n\u2022\tarts and entertainment\n\u2022\tbong joon ho\n\u2022\tfilm\n\u2022\tmovie\n\u2022\tmovies\n\u2022\tparasite\n\u2022\treview\n\u2022\twesley stenzel"}, {"text": "block-time published-time 10.11pm BST \n Au revoir!  \nAnd Bong is whisked away from the press conference, and hopefully towards a bloody big victory party. \nWith that, we're off too.

He's come in to huge cheers from the Korean journo contingent and is addressing them all at their table. Lovely stuff. \nblock-time published-time 8.49pm BST \nSo, another year without a female winner of the Palme d'Or, though there were individual prizes elsewhere for two of the four women directors appearing in competition. C\u00e9line Sciamma took home both the Queer Palm and the screenwriting prize for her luscious period drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire, while Mati Diop - on her Cannes debut, no less - took home the second biggest prize of the night, the Grand Prix.\nStill one female Palme winner in 72 editions of the Cannes film festival remains a pretty striking statistic, and though I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is right to say that the decision to award the Palme must be made based on the films themselves, Cannes could perhaps give its jurors a few more directed by women to choose from: there were just 4 of 21 in this year's official selection. \nblock-time published-time 8.36pm BST \nThe press conferences are still rumbling on. We're now hearing from the Dardennes, who won the best director prize for their film Young Ahmed. It's an intriguing shift in direction from the pair - following a young Muslim schoolboy who is lured into extremism. \"Our character excludes everybody who isn't as pure as he is,\" they say.\nblock-time published-time 8.27pm BST \n Big night for Beecham  \nWhile the lone British film in competition, Ken Loach's Sorry We Missed You, went home empty handed, there was a winner from these shores in the form of Little Joe star Emily Beecham. Viewers might have caught Beecham in the homegrown drama Daphne, where she played a self-destructive thirtysomething in the Fleabag mode. \nShe also appeared in the slightly grim post-apocalyptic drama Into the Badlands, which I must concede I haven't seen but which the Guardian described as \" absolutely bonkers... there is nothing else like it on television\".\nAnyway, this Cannes win is a big moment for an actor on the rise, and hopefully we'll see more of her soon.\nblock-time published-time 8.16pm BST \nThe question readers at home are surely asking is 'when can I see Parasite?' Unlike Okja, Bong's new one won't be appearing on Netflix (and if it was it would have been excluded from the Cannes competition due to the festival's frosty relationship with the streaming giant).\nFear not though, Curzon have picked up UK and Ireland rights with a release date to be confirmed soon. Neon, meanwhile, have nabbed the North American rights with US and Canada release dates also still to be confirmed. \nGiven that the film will surely be put forward as Korea's foreign language Oscar pick, you'd expect at least a US release date this year in order to meet Oscar qualification rules.\nblock-time published-time 8.07pm BST \nPeter Bradshaw has penned a reaction piece to this year's awards. He reckons Bong was a worthy winner, even if he was ever-so-slightly less enthusiastic about Parasite than other critics:\nKorean film-maker Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a gripping satirical parable of class, status and injustice - an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers that was widely compared to the Joseph Losey classic The Servant.\nIt is a handsomely made film, which runs as smoothly as a luxury car. I myself found myself thinking that I liked it a fraction less than Bong's other films, and other films in this Competition, but there is no doubt that it is an outstanding film.\n Related:  Sorry they missed you, Tarantino -\u00a0but Cannes was right to celebrate Parasite\nblock-time published-time 8.00pm BST \nThe jury press conference is over.

He reckons Portrait of a Lady on Fire is going to win the top gong. \n Related:  Cannes 2019: Peter Bradshaw's picks\u00a0- and Palme d'Or predictions\nblock-time published-time 5.44pm BST \n The rest  \nOn the past two occasions that I've been behind the wheel of this 'ere liveblog, I've failed to give the eventual winner even a passing mention (sorry The Square and Shoplifters). To insure myself against a similar embarrassment happening this time around, here's a quick run-down of the remaining 15 films in selection: \n Bacarau ( dir: Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho & Juliano Dornelles ) Brazilian horror-western taking aim at Bolsonaro. In with a shout of a prize, perhaps even the Palme. Review\n T he Dead Don't Die ( dir: Jim Jarmusch ) The fest's opening night film, Jarmusch's zom-com has largely been forgotten by now. Review\n Frankie ( dir: Ira Sachs ) A Huppert-starring comedy of manners that feels a tad too slight for consideration. Review\n La Gomera  ( dir: Corneliu Porumboiu ) Fun Romanian thriller where crims communicate through whistles. Screenplay prize perhaps. Review\n A Hidden Life ( dir: Terrence Malick ) Minor return to form for Malick. Maybe not enough for the Palme, but best director a possibility. Review\n    Terence Malick's A Hidden Life. Photograph: Reiner Bajo   \n It Must Be Heaven ( dir: Elia Suleiman ) The Palestinian director's self-referential satire isn't without its fans, though perhaps doesn't hit previous peaks. Review\n Les Mis\u00e9rables ( dir: Ladj Ly ) Drama about social unrest in a Paris suburb from first-time director Ly. Timely, which may help in the awards stakes. Review\n Little Joe  ( dir: Jessica Hausner ) Critics were unmoved by Hausner's chilly sci-fi parable. Might the jury be more supportive? Review\n Matthias and Maxime ( dir: Xavier Dolan ) One of the better recent efforts from former wunderkind Dolan, though struggles to stand out in a strong year. Review\n Oh Mercy! ( dir: Arnaud Desplechin ) A rather muted response for the Cannes veteran's cop thriller doesn't bode well. Review\n Sibyl ( dir: Justine Triet ) Fun psychodrama about a flawed therapist. Not the sort of film that often gets rewarded here, but Virginie Efira a dark horse for the actress prize Review\n    Sorry We Missed You, directed by Ken Loach. Photograph: PR   \n Sorry We Missed You (dir: Ken Loach) Loach can become the triple Palme winner if he triumphs here, but this stirring social drama's similarities to I, Daniel Blake may count against it. Review\n The Traitor (dir: Marco Bellocchio) Distinctly trad mob drama from the Italian veteran. Nicely put-together, but perhaps lacks the shock of the new. Review\n The Wild Goose Lake ( dir: Diao Yinan ) Chinese mob drama where someone gets run through with an umbrella. Too pulpy for the Palme? Review\n The Young Ahmed (dir: Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) Like Loach, the Dardennes can become three-time winners, but their extremist drama was slightly limply received. Review\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.50pm BST\nblock-time published-time 5.42pm BST \n You're all winners!  \nWe know about the Palme d'Or, of course, but there are a number of other awards up for grabs, in the main ceremony, including the Grand Prix prize (which essentially acts as a silver medal) and the Jury prize (which is the equivalent of bronze), plus best actor, actress, screenplay and director prizes. \nNote: if a film picks up one of those prizes, it's highly unlikely to win the Palme, due to Cannes' unwritten policy of not giving multiple awards to the same film (though sometimes multiple smaller prizes are handed out, as was the case with Lynne Ramsay winning best director and Joaquin Phoenix claiming best actor for You Were Never Really Here in 2017).\nMeanwhile, a load of other prizes have already been dished out. The winner of the Un Certain Regard sidebar was claimed by Brazilian 50s-set drama Invisible Life of Eur\u00eddice Gusm\u00e3o, while The Queer Palm for best LGBT film went, as expected, to Portrait of a Lady on Fire. \n    Quentin Tarantino claiming the Palm Dog prize on behalf of Brandy the pitbull. Photograph: Natalie Handel/AFP/Getty Images   \nElsewhere, the International Federation of Film Critics (Fipresci) prize for best first or second feature has gone to Robert Eggers' The Lighthouse, an absolute firecracker of a film starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe as warring lighthouse-keepers, which Peter Bradshaw likened to \"Steptoe and Son in hell\" in his five-star review.\nLast but certainly not least, the winner of the Palm Dog went to Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood's pitbull Brandy. Quentin Tarantino claimed the prize - a dog collar - for himself at the awards ceremony, a move that went down badly with the assembled audience! Oh, Quentin - let's hope that's not the only prize you go home with.\nblock-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.46pm BST\nblock-time published-time 5.39pm BST \nOne film that surely won't win anything tonight is Abdellatif Kechiche's Mektoub My Love: Intermezzo. A sequel to the Blue is the Warmest Colour director's hedonist opus Mektoub My Love: Canto Uno, Intermezzo has received a critical savaging for essentially being a three-and-a-half-hour-long leer at young women's backsides. It's currently got a       \u00a0    zero percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes - ouch!\nPeter Bradshaw was kinder than many critics in his write up, but didn't exactly love it. Read his review here.\nblock-time published-time 5.33pm BST \n The contenders  \nSo then, who's claiming the big ice cube with the decorative twig glued to its front? As has been the case in recent years, it looks an open race for the Palme with plenty of worthy candidates. Here though are five that we reckon are frontrunners:\n    A Palme for Pedro? Pain and Glory. Photograph: PR   \n Pain and Glory ( Dir Pedro Almod\u00f3var ) Despite appearing in competition five times previously, the Spanish director has never taken home the Palme, so a sense of him being overdue might influence the jury's decision here. The work itself, a deeply felt rumination on life, ageing and film-making that shares similarities with Fellini's 8 1/2, is likely to push their buttons too. Read Peter Bradshaw's review\n Portrait of a Lady on Fire ( Dir C\u00e9line Sciamma ) Again, the weight of history might play a part here: only one female director, Jane Campion, has ever won Cannes' top prize - and even then she had to share it with Farewell My Concubine director Chen Kaige. Moreover, Sciamma's 18th-century-set romance is arguably the strongest film in the entire competition. Expect an outcry if it doesn't win something major here. Read Peter Bradshaw's review\n    Very much in the running... Parasite. Photograph: 2019 CJ ENM Corporation, Barunson E&A   \n Parasite ( Dir Bong Joon-ho ) Like Portrait..., this dizzying South Korean drama from the director of Snowpiercer and Okja has been received rapturously by audiences. And with good reason - it's a terrifically tense thriller with much to say about inequality and capitalism's clammy hold over society. I do slightly wonder whether the film's genre elements might hold it back, but it definitely is in the running. Read Peter Bradshaw's review\n Atlantique ( Dir Mati Diop ) The first black female director to ever appear in competition at Cannes, Diop has generated much buzz with her thoughtful, inventive drama about Senegalese migrants. It features a supernatural tinge that hasn't gone down well with everyone, but if the jury was looking to make a statement with their Palme pick, this might just be the best bet. Read Peter Bradshaw's review\n    Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Allstar/COLUMBIA PICTURES CORPORATION   \n Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood ( Dir Quentin Tarantino ) Tarantino's return to Cannes went more swimmingly than many expected, given that his latest tackles the tricky subject of the Manson murders. In the event, this ode to the last knockings of the old studio system might just be Tarantino's best work since the first Kill Bill, even if the film's third act left some cold. Might longstanding affection for QT push him over the top here? Read Peter Bradshaw's review\nblock-time published-time 4.34pm BST \n Bonsoir!  \n... and welcome to the Guardian's Cannes film festival awards liveblog. After a fortnight spent worshipping at the altar of 'le cinema' we're finally ready to find out which of 21 films will be awarded prestige film-making's most important prize, the Palme d'Or. It looks set to be an interesting race this year, with some big-hitting auteurs, including Quentin Tarantino and Pedro Almod\u00f3var, facing off against cinema's coming forces, like Bong Joon-ho and C\u00e9line Sciamma.\nWe'll have the results as they happen, as well as those for the other awards being handed out this evening. The ceremony begins at 7.15pm local time (6.15pm in the UK), so stick with us for news, a little bit of insight, and - most crucially of all - the recipient of this year's 'Palm Dog'."}, {"text": "Dec 27, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke On Christmas Eve, a Twitter user asked Elon Musk what his favorite film of 2019 was.

In a history-making sweep on January 13, it received six Oscar nominations, including one in the prestigious Best Picture category. Last Sunday, the Screen Actors Guild gav e Parasite's acting ensemble its top award[3] for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, selecting it above the legendary lineups for The Irishman, Bombshell, Jojo Rabbit, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Ad Policy[4] For Bong, Parasite's manic and innovative director, it was overdue recognition. His brilliant exposure of the deep class fissures in South Korea has struck an evocative chord in America\u2014and demonstrates that foreign cinema can penetrate the American psyche. #8216;Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,#8217; he said[5] after Parasite became the first Korean film to win a Golden Globe. Parasite's success in the US market is a little surprising, in part because most Americans and the US media show little interest in South Korea's internal dynamics and complex domestic politics. Yet, despite some criticism, including in this magazine[6], of Bong's satiric take on inequality, the film has taught many viewers that there's an intriguing and even revolutionary side to South Korea outside of K-Pop and the DMZ. Now, if only someone could make a film to correct the myths and assumptions that have driven American policy on the Korean Peninsula for decades and led to the latest breakdown in the Korea peace process that began with such promise[7] in the winter of 2018.  Related Articles Just as the South is often stereotyped as a model capitalist economy that would not exist without the beneficent presence of US troops, North Korea is universally viewed in Washington as a kind of Forever Enemy ruled by an irrational family dynasty that, for no apparent reason, hates the United States and belligerently threatens its friends and allies with nukes. Why they built these weapons is rarely addressed. And the roots of the conflict\u2014the division of Korea in 1945 at the hands of the United States and a war that has never formally ended\u2014are generally ignored. For example: The Great Successor[8], the acclaimed biography of Kim Jong-un and the nuclear crisis by Washington Post reporter Anna Fifield, doesn't even mention the fact that the United States first introduced nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and, after withdrawing them in 1991, still maintains a powerful nuclear force in Northeast Asia. Some commentators dismiss Kim's fears of the United States\u2014which laid waste to his lands during the Korean War\u2014as sheer fantasy. #8216;Like all dictators, Kim thrives on conflict with the outside world, especially the U.S., which the hermit kingdom's state-run media likes to call the #8216;savage enemy,'#8217; The Dallas Morning News recently proclaimed[9], as if Kim's weapons program was due simply to his need for an enemy. To buttress its case, it threw in a quote from B.R. Myers, whose 2010 book The Cleanest Race is, in my view[10], one of the most distorted books ever written about the North: #8216;Without the U.S., without that enemy figure, [North Korea] really has no reason to exist.#8217;  Current Issue https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/ It's as if the United States is an innocent bystander, just doing its darndest to maintain the peace against a belligerent foe that never lets up. That ahistorical approach also pertains to Pyongyang's diplomacy with Trump. The consensus in Washington's think tank world is that Kim's reluctance to immediately get rid of all his nukes after his 2018 summit with Trump\u2014and his testing last year of missiles that could potentially hit US bases in South Korea, Japan, and Guam during a war or to ward off an attack\u2014are proof of his aggressive intent and his insincerity about seeking peace. Even though no formal agreements have been reached on denuclearization or improving US#8212;North Korea ties, Kim is just #8216;playing#8217; Trump by building up his military forces, the thinking goes. #8216;All these advances, made during a period when the relationship between Pyongyang and Washington was supposedly never better, show that Kim is not interested in disarming,#8217; Eric Brewer, a nuclear analyst and former national security official at the corporate- and contractor-funded[11] Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote[12] this month in a typical comment. For the most part, the media seem to agree, and the American people follow[13]. According to a poll conducted[14] in November by The Economist, 56 percent of Americans consider North Korea to be an enemy of the United States, up from 51 percent in August. Many Democratic leaders are in the distortion game too. #8216;Look, we gave [Kim] everything he's looking for,#8217; Joe Biden declared[15] at the last Democratic debate on January 14 in explaining why he would refuse to meet with the North Korean leader without preconditions. #8216;The president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him.#8217;  Biden also claimed that he would somehow pressure China\u2014which has lately been working with Russia[16] to win support in the UN for a proposal to ease sanctions on North Korea\u2014to force its ally to disarm. None of this was remotely true, but Biden's claims weren't challenged by any of his fellow candidates or the press. Thankfully, there is a South Korean who can, as Bong Joon-ho and his ensemble did in Parasite, cut through the fog.  Moon Chung-in is a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University and a key adviser to President Moon Jae-in on national security and unification issues. An erudite, affable man well-known to US policy-makers, Moon travels frequently to Washington to unofficially convey South Korea's views. He's been to Pyongyang several times, most recently in September 2018, when he accompanied President Moon to his exuberant summit[17] with Kim Jong-un, where a major deal was struck to lower military tensions.        \u00a0    https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/moon-chung-in-img.jpg Moon Chung-in speaking at the Center for the National Interest, January 6. (Tim Shorrock) There, #8216;I saw the great possibility of peace,#8217; Moon Chung-in said during his latest visit to DC in January. As a result of the North-South agreement in Pyongyang, #8216;there's been no clashes on the DMZ#8217; since then. The #8216;only violation#8217; of the agreement came in early 2019, he said, when Kim Jong-un ordered a military exercise deploying short-range missiles. But for the North, he said, Trump's refusal to budge on sanctions as a way to get a deal with Kim is at the heart of their dispute. #8216;For Pyongyang, Washington's call for dialogue is nothing but a fig leaf to hide its intention to isolate, contain and strangle the North through sanctions and maximum pressure,#8217; he wrote[18] in The Korea Times. #8216;A catastrophic turn does not appear imminent, but time seems to be on nobody's side.#8217; In public remarks, he also pointed out that the North is increasingly irked by the criticism of its intentions from US politicians. #8216;Their concern is how American political stakeholders take advantage of North Korea for personal political gain.#8217; Here's the problem, from the South Korean's perspective: Since the first summit in Singapore[19], the Trump administration, despite pleadings from Seoul, has refused to lift sanctions on the North, even ones that could have helped President Moon carry out economic projects that he and Kim agreed to at their summit in Pyongyang. The lack of progress in the inter-Korean peace process, and South Korea's own military buildup, have greatly angered Kim and the North Korean leadership, who in the fall of 2019 resumed their harsh public criticism of the South and the United States. The tensions were quite apparent on January 1, when Kim delivered a New Year's statement and warned his nation to prepare for more hard times ahead. #8216;The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future,#8217; Kim said[20] in remarks carried by KCNA, the state media outlet. Flanked by hundreds of cadre from his ruling Korean Workers' Party, Kim talked mysteriously of a #8216;new strategic weapon#8217; he might deliver in the future\u2014but left the door open for dialogue if the United States makes a fundamental change and stops treating North Korea like an enemy. #8216;If the US persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK, there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula,#8217; Kim warned, using a phrase that North Korea has been repeating for years, if not decades. His phrasing was repeated word-for-word[21] this week in Geneva, when Ju Yong Chol, one of Kim's diplomats at the UN, warned[22] that if America's #8216;hostile policy#8217; continued, the North would have #8216;no reason to be unilaterally bound any longer by the commitment that the other party fails to honor.#8217; Chol added: #8216;If the United States tries to enforce unilateral demands and persists in imposing sanctions, North Korea may be compelled to seek a new path,#8217; which US officials and generals believe[23] could include reviving the tests of long-range missiles that were suspended in 2017.  Unfortunately for the North, Dr. Moon said, many US policy-makers ignore the term #8216;hostile policy,#8217; claiming that Kim's use of it is just #8216;habitual.#8217; In doing so, he pointed out, they miss a chance to understand how an actual deal might be cut with North Korea under the right conditions. #8216;#8216;Hostile policy' is quite seriously meant,#8217; he told a conference on January 6 organized by the Center for the National Interest, a conservative think tank in Washington. They believe the policy #8216;threatens the security of North Korea and hampers the North Korean people's right to exist.#8217; During the Q&A, I asked Moon to explain what he made of the term, and he provided the most specific explanation I have heard in years of covering the issue. #8216;North Korea has been very clear,#8217; he replied. First, they mean the #8216;elimination of sanctions,#8217; which to them is #8216;the most important indicator of the hostile policy from the United States.#8217; Second, political matters: #8216;Normalize. Make [diplomatic] ties. Set up liaison offices, set up embassies with each other. That would be their most important indicator of ending the hostility.#8217; Third, the military side: #8216;A non-aggression treaty, signing a lasting peace treaty. Obviously suspending joint military exercise and training#8217; with South Korea #8216;and not deploying strategic weapons on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Finally, the North wants the United States to help make it #8216;a normal country in the international economic system.#8217; That means #8216;not only lifting sanctions but allowing North Korea to be a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank, and to let North Korea engage in normal trade and financial transactions and allow international investment into North Korea. It's all very clear.#8217; Obviously, meeting those demands would require a major shift in policy on the part of the United States, with North Korea no longer seen as a permanent enemy. For the North, they are an essential part of any deal, just as long-term denuclearization is for the United States. That, Moon explained, should underscore why Washington can't insist on #8216;permanent and irreversible#8217; denuclearization in North Korea\u2014Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's favorite phrase\u2014before making any moves to reduce the sanctions. #8216;That won't work,#8217; Moon said. #8216;It's why North Korea says you must #8216;permanently and irreversibly' withdraw your hostile policy#8217; before it will come back to the table. #8216;They're using your own words,#8217; he said with a chuckle. #8216;So there's a complete parallel between Washington and Pyongyang.#8217; And that's why, in his view, both sides #8216;need to be more flexible and realistic.#8217; In his address to the center, Moon indirectly confirmed reports in my last dispatch for The Nation[24] that a US#8212;South Korea military buildup over the past two years may have damaged prospects for a settlement by aggravating the North. Since Moon Jae-in took power in 2017, he explained, the president has emphasized #8216;peace-keeping,#8217; by which he means #8216;suppressing the possibility of war through deterrence and strengthening the US military alliance.#8217; This policy emerged as a result of the tensions during the #8216;nightmarish#8217; year of 2017, when war appeared imminent, as well as from military decisions made by #8216;previous governments#8217; with the United States. As a result, South Korea has acquired advanced US weapons, including F-35 fighter jets and high-altitude Global Hawk drones, as I described in my Nation story. Meanwhile, in 2020, South Korea will spend 53 trillion won\u2014about $46 billion\u2014on its military, #8216;slightly larger than Japan,#8217; Moon said. #8216;Contrary to what conservatives in South Korea claim, we have been cooperating with the United States 100 percent.#8217; But North Korea is #8216;very angry about that,#8217; he said. #8216;We see the idea of peace-keeping as defensive,#8217; but Pyongyang #8216;doesn't see it that way.#8217; As a result, #8216;peace-keeping has been sort of backfiring.#8217; But, while South Korea and the United States have worked in tandem to maintain their military readiness, the #8216;peace-building#8217; aspect of President Moon Jae-in's policies has fallen by the wayside. When President Moon launched his initiative in 2018, he envisioned that the United States and the two Koreas could sign a declaration ending the Korean War and transform the 1953 armistice that ended the fighting into a #8216;viable peace regime,#8217; the professor said. But the Trump administration has showed no interest in ending the war or signing a peace treaty, so that plan has gone unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the hard line on sanctions #8216;has prevented South Korea's engagement with North Korea,#8217; said Moon Chung-in. Projects halted included plans to restore cross-border rail links, reopening the Gaesong Industrial Zone just north of the DMZ, and making it possible for South Koreans to visit Mount Kumgang in the North once again. As a result, Moon said, #8216;inter-Korean relations are completely frozen.#8217; That, in turn, has created a serious political dilemma for South Korea in its cooperation with the United States. #8216;If the US fails to reopen negotiations with North Korea#8217; and settle its conflict with Kim, #8216;it can't make a breakthrough.#8217; And because South Korea is a democracy, #8216;President Moon's supporters say South Korea must take an independent stand.#8217; With some prescience, he added that President Moon #8216;doesn't want to be passive. He wants to be a mediator, a facilitator, and arbitrator, and a pacesetter of the Korean destiny.#8217; That process has apparently started. On January 14, President Moon declared[25] in a press conference that he would henceforth stress cooperation with the North over the negotiations between the United States and Pyongyang. #8216;Rather than only watching North Korea#8212;US dialogue, we need to cooperate with North Korea on as many things as possible,#8217; he told reporters at the Blue House. #8216;Since inter-Korean relations are a Korean matter, we need to take more of the initiative in developing them.#8217; As the progressive newspaper Hankyoreh noted[26], #8216;the gist of these remarks is that inter-Korean relations should be the driver of the peace process on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Moon's speech sparked an extraordinary dispute when Harry Harris[27], the US ambassador, told foreign reporters in Seoul[28] that South Korea must consult with Washington on any plans for cross-border engagement with the North #8216;in order to avoid a misunderstanding later that could trigger sanctions.#8217; In response, Lee Sang-min, a spokesperson for the Unification Ministry, reminded[29] Harris that South Korea is a sovereign nation that #8216;dictates its own policies#8217; toward the North. This week, the State Department backed[30] Harris, saying his views #8216;represent#8217; those of President Trump. But the Moon government appears determined to press on, even within the confines of the US and UN sanctions. On Tuesday, Lee Soo-hyuck, the South Korean ambassador in Washington, said[31] Seoul is especially hopeful that the cross-border railway project can be revived. #8216;I believe the project we should push for most urgently, and is doable, is connecting the railway network between South Korea and the North because it will take the longest [time] to complete,#8217; he told reporters. #8216;The overarching principle of the projects the government is pushing is that we should do the most we can within the framework of international sanctions.#8217; Despite the differences, Moon Chung-in says it's imperative for the talks between the three parties\u2014Seoul, Pyongyang, and Washington\u2014to get back on track. #8216;South Korea has heard North Korea's grievances,#8217; he said in Washington. #8216;It's time for North Korea to come back to the table and settle#8217; and for both sides to come up with innovative solutions. In his view, that might involve the United States' adopting a #8216;nuclear arms control paradigm#8217; toward the North, signing a peace treaty, and eventually negotiating a #8216;phased US troop withdrawal#8217; from the South as well as an international fund to support North Korea's denuclearization. #8216;We need creative diplomacy,#8217; he said. Perhaps the best antidote to the gloom is the sense of humor and humanity that both Dr. Moon and Parasite's characters adopt toward their brethren to the north. There's a hilarious scene[32] in Bong's film when one of his characters mimics the rapturous voice of Ri Chun-hee, North Korea's famous anchorwoman[33], who is often chosen to deliver the supreme leader's most momentous announcements to his people. But this gentle ribbing shouldn't necessarily be seen as criticizing the North, Bong said[34] in an interview last year. #8216;There are a lot of comics in South Korea who make sketches on [North Korean] topics and it's something that's very common in South Korea,#8217; he said. In other words, laughing about their situation is one way Koreans cope with the stress of division and war. But perhaps the deeper meaning is about survival in a city divided along class lines and a country split into rich South and poor North. #8216;I think the [Parasite] story is about coexistence and how we can all live together,#8217; Song Kang-ho[35], the beloved character actor who plays the family patriarch, said in receiving the cast's SAG award last Sunday. A little laughter\u2014and a lot of truth\u2014about America's dark fears of the North might go a long way in Washington too.

In a history-making sweep on January 13, it received six Oscar nominations, including one in the prestigious Best Picture category. Last Sunday, the Screen Actors Guild gave Parasite's acting ensemble its top award[3] for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, selecting it above the legendary lineups for The Irishman, Bombshell, Jojo Rabbit, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Ad Policy[4] For Bong, Parasite's manic and innovative director, it was overdue recognition. His brilliant exposure of the deep class fissures in South Korea has struck an evocative chord in America\u2014and demonstrates that foreign cinema can penetrate the American psyche. #8216;Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,#8217; he said[5] after Parasite became the first Korean film to win a Golden Globe. Parasite's success in the US market is a little surprising, in part because most Americans and the US media show little interest in South Korea's internal dynamics and complex domestic politics. Yet, despite some criticism, including in this magazine[6], of Bong's satiric take on inequality, the film has taught many viewers that there's an intriguing and even revolutionary side to South Korea outside of K-Pop and the DMZ. Now, if only someone could make a film to correct the myths and assumptions that have driven American policy on the Korean Peninsula for decades and led to the latest breakdown in the Korea peace process that began with such promise[7] in the winter of 2018.  Related Articles Just as the South is often stereotyped as a model capitalist economy that would not exist without the beneficent presence of US troops, North Korea is universally viewed in Washington as a kind of Forever Enemy ruled by an irrational family dynasty that, for no apparent reason, hates the United States and belligerently threatens its friends and allies with nukes. Why they built these weapons is rarely addressed. And the roots of the conflict\u2014the division of Korea in 1945 at the hands of the United States and a war that has never formally ended\u2014are generally ignored. For example: The Great Successor[8], the acclaimed biography of Kim Jong-un and the nuclear crisis by Washington Post reporter Anna Fifield, doesn't even mention the fact that the United States first introduced nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and, after withdrawing them in 1991, still maintains a powerful nuclear force in Northeast Asia. Some commentators dismiss Kim's fears of the United States\u2014which laid waste to his lands during the Korean War\u2014as sheer fantasy. #8216;Like all dictators, Kim thrives on conflict with the outside world, especially the U.S., which the hermit kingdom's state-run media likes to call the #8216;savage enemy,'#8217; The Dallas Morning News recently proclaimed[9], as if Kim's weapons program was due simply to his need for an enemy. To buttress its case, it threw in a quote from B.R. Myers, whose 2010 book The Cleanest Race is, in my view[10], one of the most distorted books ever written about the North: #8216;Without the U.S., without that enemy figure, [North Korea] really has no reason to exist.#8217;  Current Issue https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/ It's as if the United States is an innocent bystander, just doing its darndest to maintain the peace against a belligerent foe that never lets up. That ahistorical approach also pertains to Pyongyang's diplomacy with Trump. The consensus in Washington's think tank world is that Kim's reluctance to immediately get rid of all his nukes after his 2018 summit with Trump\u2014and his testing last year of missiles that could potentially hit US bases in South Korea, Japan, and Guam during a war or to ward off an attack\u2014are proof of his aggressive intent and his insincerity about seeking peace. Even though no formal agreements have been reached on denuclearization or improving US#8212;North Korea ties, Kim is just #8216;playing#8217; Trump by building up his military forces, the thinking goes. #8216;All these advances, made during a period when the relationship between Pyongyang and Washington was supposedly never better, show that Kim is not interested in disarming,#8217; Eric Brewer, a nuclear analyst and former national security official at the corporate- and contractor-funded[11] Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote[12] this month in a typical comment. For the most part, the media seem to agree, and the American people follow[13]. According to a poll conducted[14] in November by The Economist, 56 percent of Americans consider North Korea to be an enemy of the United States, up from 51 percent in August. Many Democratic leaders are in the distortion game too. #8216;Look, we gave [Kim] everything he's looking for,#8217; Joe Biden declared[15] at the last Democratic debate on January 14 in explaining why he would refuse to meet with the North Korean leader without preconditions. #8216;The president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him.#8217;  Biden also claimed that he would somehow pressure China\u2014which has lately been working with Russia[16] to win support in the UN for a proposal to ease sanctions on North Korea\u2014to force its ally to disarm. None of this was remotely true, but Biden's claims weren't challenged by any of his fellow candidates or the press. Thankfully, there is a South Korean who can, as Bong Joon-ho and his ensemble did in Parasite, cut through the fog.  Moon Chung-in is a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University and a key adviser to President Moon Jae-in on national security and unification issues. An erudite, affable man well-known to US policy-makers, Moon travels frequently to Washington to unofficially convey South Korea's views. He's been to Pyongyang several times, most recently in September 2018, when he accompanied President Moon to his exuberant summit[17] with Kim Jong-un, where a major deal was struck to lower military tensions.        \u00a0    https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/moon-chung-in-img.jpg Moon Chung-in speaking at the Center for the National Interest, January 6. (Tim Shorrock) There, #8216;I saw the great possibility of peace,#8217; Moon Chung-in said during his latest visit to DC in January. As a result of the North-South agreement in Pyongyang, #8216;there's been no clashes on the DMZ#8217; since then. The #8216;only violation#8217; of the agreement came in early 2019, he said, when Kim Jong-un ordered a military exercise deploying short-range missiles. But for the North, he said, Trump's refusal to budge on sanctions as a way to get a deal with Kim is at the heart of their dispute. #8216;For Pyongyang, Washington's call for dialogue is nothing but a fig leaf to hide its intention to isolate, contain and strangle the North through sanctions and maximum pressure,#8217; he wrote[18] in The Korea Times. #8216;A catastrophic turn does not appear imminent, but time seems to be on nobody's side.#8217; In public remarks, he also pointed out that the North is increasingly irked by the criticism of its intentions from US politicians. #8216;Their concern is how American political stakeholders take advantage of North Korea for personal political gain.#8217; Here's the problem, from the South Korean's perspective: Since the first summit in Singapore[19], the Trump administration, despite pleadings from Seoul, has refused to lift sanctions on the North, even ones that could have helped President Moon carry out economic projects that he and Kim agreed to at their summit in Pyongyang. The lack of progress in the inter-Korean peace process, and South Korea's own military buildup, have greatly angered Kim and the North Korean leadership, who in the fall of 2019 resumed their harsh public criticism of the South and the United States. The tensions were quite apparent on January 1, when Kim delivered a New Year's statement and warned his nation to prepare for more hard times ahead. #8216;The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future,#8217; Kim said[20] in remarks carried by KCNA, the state media outlet. Flanked by hundreds of cadre from his ruling Korean Workers' Party, Kim talked mysteriously of a #8216;new strategic weapon#8217; he might deliver in the future\u2014but left the door open for dialogue if the United States makes a fundamental change and stops treating North Korea like an enemy. #8216;If the US persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK, there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula,#8217; Kim warned, using a phrase that North Korea has been repeating for years, if not decades. His phrasing was repeated word-for-word[21] this week in Geneva, when Ju Yong Chol, one of Kim's diplomats at the UN, warned[22] that if America's #8216;hostile policy#8217; continued, the North would have #8216;no reason to be unilaterally bound any longer by the commitment that the other party fails to honor.#8217; Chol added: #8216;If the United States tries to enforce unilateral demands and persists in imposing sanctions, North Korea may be compelled to seek a new path,#8217; which US officials and generals believe[23] could include reviving the tests of long-range missiles that were suspended in 2017.  Unfortunately for the North, Dr. Moon said, many US policy-makers ignore the term #8216;hostile policy,#8217; claiming that Kim's use of it is just #8216;habitual.#8217; In doing so, he pointed out, they miss a chance to understand how an actual deal might be cut with North Korea under the right conditions. #8216;#8216;Hostile policy' is quite seriously meant,#8217; he told a conference on January 6 organized by the Center for the National Interest, a conservative think tank in Washington. They believe the policy #8216;threatens the security of North Korea and hampers the North Korean people's right to exist.#8217; During the Q&A, I asked Moon to explain what he made of the term, and he provided the most specific explanation I have heard in years of covering the issue. #8216;North Korea has been very clear,#8217; he replied. First, they mean the #8216;elimination of sanctions,#8217; which to them is #8216;the most important indicator of the hostile policy from the United States.#8217; Second, political matters: #8216;Normalize. Make [diplomatic] ties. Set up liaison offices, set up embassies with each other. That would be their most important indicator of ending the hostility.#8217; Third, the military side: #8216;A non-aggression treaty, signing a lasting peace treaty. Obviously suspending joint military exercise and training#8217; with South Korea #8216;and not deploying strategic weapons on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Finally, the North wants the United States to help make it #8216;a normal country in the international economic system.#8217; That means #8216;not only lifting sanctions but allowing North Korea to be a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank, and to let North Korea engage in normal trade and financial transactions and allow international investment into North Korea. It's all very clear.#8217; Obviously, meeting those demands would require a major shift in policy on the part of the United States, with North Korea no longer seen as a permanent enemy. For the North, they are an essential part of any deal, just as long-term denuclearization is for the United States. That, Moon explained, should underscore why Washington can't insist on #8216;permanent and irreversible#8217; denuclearization in North Korea\u2014Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's favorite phrase\u2014before making any moves to reduce the sanctions. #8216;That won't work,#8217; Moon said. #8216;It's why North Korea says you must #8216;permanently and irreversibly' withdraw your hostile policy#8217; before it will come back to the table. #8216;They're using your own words,#8217; he said with a chuckle. #8216;So there's a complete parallel between Washington and Pyongyang.#8217; And that's why, in his view, both sides #8216;need to be more flexible and realistic.#8217; In his address to the center, Moon indirectly confirmed reports in my last dispatch for The Nation[24] that a US#8212;South Korea military buildup over the past two years may have damaged prospects for a settlement by aggravating the North. Since Moon Jae-in took power in 2017, he explained, the president has emphasized #8216;peace-keeping,#8217; by which he means #8216;suppressing the possibility of war through deterrence and strengthening the US military alliance.#8217; This policy emerged as a result of the tensions during the #8216;nightmarish#8217; year of 2017, when war appeared imminent, as well as from military decisions made by #8216;previous governments#8217; with the United States. As a result, South Korea has acquired advanced US weapons, including F-35 fighter jets and high-altitude Global Hawk drones, as I described in my Nation story. Meanwhile, in 2020, South Korea will spend 53 trillion won\u2014about $46 billion\u2014on its military, #8216;slightly larger than Japan,#8217; Moon said. #8216;Contrary to what conservatives in South Korea claim, we have been cooperating with the United States 100 percent.#8217; But North Korea is #8216;very angry about that,#8217; he said. #8216;We see the idea of peace-keeping as defensive,#8217; but Pyongyang #8216;doesn't see it that way.#8217; As a result, #8216;peace-keeping has been sort of backfiring.#8217; But, while South Korea and the United States have worked in tandem to maintain their military readiness, the #8216;peace-building#8217; aspect of President Moon Jae-in's policies has fallen by the wayside. When President Moon launched his initiative in 2018, he envisioned that the United States and the two Koreas could sign a declaration ending the Korean War and transform the 1953 armistice that ended the fighting into a #8216;viable peace regime,#8217; the professor said. But the Trump administration has showed no interest in ending the war or signing a peace treaty, so that plan has gone unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the hard line on sanctions #8216;has prevented South Korea's engagement with North Korea,#8217; said Moon Chung-in. Projects halted included plans to restore cross-border rail links, reopening the Gaesong Industrial Zone just north of the DMZ, and making it possible for South Koreans to visit Mount Kumgang in the North once again. As a result, Moon said, #8216;inter-Korean relations are completely frozen.#8217; That, in turn, has created a serious political dilemma for South Korea in its cooperation with the United States. #8216;If the US fails to reopen negotiations with North Korea#8217; and settle its conflict with Kim, #8216;it can't make a breakthrough.#8217; And because South Korea is a democracy, #8216;President Moon's supporters say South Korea must take an independent stand.#8217; With some prescience, he added that President Moon #8216;doesn't want to be passive. He wants to be a mediator, a facilitator, and arbitrator, and a pacesetter of the Korean destiny.#8217; That process has apparently started. On January 14, President Moon declared[25] in a press conference that he would henceforth stress cooperation with the North over the negotiations between the United States and Pyongyang. #8216;Rather than only watching North Korea#8212;US dialogue, we need to cooperate with North Korea on as many things as possible,#8217; he told reporters at the Blue House. #8216;Since inter-Korean relations are a Korean matter, we need to take more of the initiative in developing them.#8217; As the progressive newspaper Hankyoreh noted[26], #8216;the gist of these remarks is that inter-Korean relations should be the driver of the peace process on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Moon's speech sparked an extraordinary dispute when Harry Harris[27], the US ambassador, told foreign reporters in Seoul[28] that South Korea must consult with Washington on any plans for cross-border engagement with the North #8216;in order to avoid a misunderstanding later that could trigger sanctions.#8217; In response, Lee Sang-min, a spokesperson for the Unification Ministry, reminded[29] Harris that South Korea is a sovereign nation that #8216;dictates its own policies#8217; toward the North. This week, the State Department backed[30] Harris, saying his views #8216;represent#8217; those of President Trump. But the Moon government appears determined to press on, even within the confines of the US and UN sanctions. On Tuesday, Lee Soo-hyuck, the South Korean ambassador in Washington, said[31] Seoul is especially hopeful that the cross-border railway project can be revived. #8216;I believe the project we should push for most urgently, and is doable, is connecting the railway network between South Korea and the North because it will take the longest [time] to complete,#8217; he told reporters. #8216;The overarching principle of the projects the government is pushing is that we should do the most we can within the framework of international sanctions.#8217; Despite the differences, Moon Chung-in says it's imperative for the talks between the three parties\u2014Seoul, Pyongyang, and Washington\u2014to get back on track. #8216;South Korea has heard North Korea's grievances,#8217; he said in Washington. #8216;It's time for North Korea to come back to the table and settle#8217; and for both sides to come up with innovative solutions. In his view, that might involve the United States' adopting a #8216;nuclear arms control paradigm#8217; toward the North, signing a peace treaty, and eventually negotiating a #8216;phased US troop withdrawal#8217; from the South as well as an international fund to support North Korea's denuclearization. #8216;We need creative diplomacy,#8217; he said. Perhaps the best antidote to the gloom is the sense of humor and humanity that both Dr. Moon and Parasite's characters adopt toward their brethren to the north. There's a hilarious scene[32] in Bong's film when one of his characters mimics the rapturous voice of Ri Chun-hee, North Korea's famous anchorwoman[33], who is often chosen to deliver the supreme leader's most momentous announcements to his people. But this gentle ribbing shouldn't necessarily be seen as criticizing the North, Bong said[34] in an interview last year. #8216;There are a lot of comics in South Korea who make sketches on [North Korean] topics and it's something that's very common in South Korea,#8217; he said. In other words, laughing about their situation is one way Koreans cope with the stress of division and war. But perhaps the deeper meaning is about survival in a city divided along class lines and a country split into rich South and poor North. #8216;I think the [Parasite] story is about coexistence and how we can all live together,#8217; Song Kang-ho[35], the beloved character actor who plays the family patriarch, said in receiving the cast's SAG award last Sunday. A little laughter\u2014and a lot of truth\u2014about America's dark fears of the North might go a long way in Washington too.

But this thrilling epic about a love triangle during World War I - for over 80 years, the only silent film to win Best Picture - merits wider recognition.\nFrom its archetypal Hollywood melodrama, to its dazzling depiction of dogfights, and a standout performance from Clara Bow as the plucky nurse Mary, the 144-minute runtime glides by.\n                                            2. 1930: The Broadway Melody                                        \nThe formerly little-known production company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) was founded in 1924, and only five years later it had chalked up its first Academy Award win. The Broadway Melody - MGM's first ever musical - tells the tale of Harriet (Bessie Love) and Queenie Mahoney (Anite Page), a beautiful vaudeville act who arrive at Broadway, and become swept up in New York high society.\nWhile it was wildly successful at the time, it seems audiences were more impressed by the mere presence of sound and Technicolor sequences, because the musical numbers are banal and uninspired.\n                                            3. 1931: All Quiet on the Western Front                                        \nAdapted from the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of the First World War, this film centres on a group of German schoolboys, who are convinced to enlist by their jingoistic professor. Director Lewis Milestone, who won a second consecutive Best Director Oscar for the film, made one of the most influential anti-war films ever simply by showing the ravages of war through the eyes of these young German recruits.\n                                            4. 1932: Cimarron                                        \nPerhaps as a reflection of the movie industry's growing prowess, RKO Radio Pictures invested more than $1.5 million into their production of Edna Ferber's epic novel about the history of a frontier family, despite being mired in the woes of the Great Depression.\nThe Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 prompted thousands to relocate to claim free government land, and in Cimarron, Yancey Cravat (Richard Dix) takes his young family to build their newspaper Oklahoma Wigwam into an empire.\n                                            5. 1933: Grand Hotel                                        \nReworked from former chambermaid Vicki Baum's novel Menschen im Hotel, the film stars Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford as guests in Berlin's grandest hotel. Joan Crawford once said of her performance in Grand Hotel: \"Little Joan was called upon to match Garbo, Beery and the Barrymores and she came off smelling like a rose.\"\nIt's difficult to begrudge the actor such an accolade given her showing as the glittering, ambitious stenographer Flaemmchen.\n                                            6. 1934: Cavalcade                                        \nDirected by Frank Lloyd and adapted from the Noel Coward play, Cavalcade was a darling of the box-office and critics alike. It was even credited with stirring up patriotism before that year's general election.\nFrom the turn of the twentieth century, we view a changing Britain through the lives of two families: the swanky Marryots (Diana Wynyard and Clive Brook) and their staff, the Bridges (Una O'Connor and Herbert Mundin).\n                                            7. 1935: It Happened One Night                                        \n'Daughter escaped again!' shouts the father of capricious heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) as she swims away from his yacht. On her way to one unsuitable man she falls for another: the struggling reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who offers her help in exchange for a society scoop.\nIt Happened One Night won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director (Frank Capra) and Screenplay, making it the first film to win all five of the big awards.\n                                            8. 1936: Mutiny on the Bounty                                        \nBased on a cycle of bestselling novels co-written by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, this rollicking movie became one of the quintessential nautical adventures. Directed by Frank Lloyd, it focuses on an eighteenth century voyage from Tahiti to the West Indies.\nSmarting from the cruelty of Captain Bligh (Charles Laughton), the noble first mate Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable) leads the crew of English conscripts to mutiny, and a new life on a paradise island.\nBeing filmed on location, Mutiny on the Bounty blew its $2 million budget, but became the most profitable film of the year.\n                                            9. 1937: The Great Ziegfeld                                        \nRunning at three hours, requiring a thousand employees, and taking hundreds of designers six months to produce its costumes, Robert Z. Leonard and Hunt Stromberg's The Great Ziegfeld is seen to epitomise the glamour and extravagance of Hollywood's golden age.\nInspired by the real-life Chicago impresario Flo Ziegfeld Jr., it charts the multiple rises, falls, rivalries and marriages of the charismatic showman, here played by William Powell. It was one of the biggest movies of the 1930s.\n                                            10. 1938: The Life of Emile Zola                                        \nWilliam Dieterle's portrait of the famous French author was lauded by critics upon release, being proclaimed the best biographical picture yet made.\nA fictionalised account of the writer's battle for social justice, the film centres on his historical involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, which saw an innocent Jewish soldier accused of treason to cover up the crime of a wealthy superior.\nBut as it was filmed against the backdrop of the rise of the Nazis and their oppression of European Jews, people still debate whether the film could have done more to denounce anti-semitism.\n                                            11. 1939: You Can't Take It With You                                        \nScooping Frank Capra his third Best Director Oscar as well as the Best Picture, You Can't Take It With You is an adaptation of the Pulitzer-Prize winning play of the same name by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart.\nThe romantic comedy starring James Stewart and Jean Arthur follows a head-on collision of values and lifestyle when stenographer Alice (Arthur) introduces her eccentric and unmaterialistic family to the relatives of her fiance Tony (Stewart), who are wealthy, status-driven tycoons.\n                                            12. 1940: Gone With the Wind                                        \nWinning 8 Oscars including Best Actress for Vivian Leigh and Best Director for Victor Fleming, this classic adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel remains the most successful film in box office history.\nSet against the backdrop of the American Civil War and reconstruction, it follows the romantic travails of a plantation owner's daughter, Scarlett O'Hara.\nIt was an epic in every sense: over 1400 women were allegedly interviewed in the famous 'search for Scarlett', and Fleming was briefly replaced as director by Sam Wood, while he took time off due to exhaustion.\n                                            13. 1941: Rebecca                                        \nThis early Hitchcock thriller portrays a naive young bride, who marries rich widower Maxim De Winter, and soon discovers how he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, in a boating accident the year before. Rebecca's death seems to have had an unnatural effect on all the residents of De Winter's large country estate.\nDespite not including the one murder that takes place in the Du Maurier novel, the film still evokes all the psychological unease and suspense we would expect from a Hitchcock.\n                                            14. 1942: How Green Was My Valley                                        \nOne of the few Hollywood blockbusters set in rural Wales, How Green Was My Valley tells the story of the Morgans through the eyes of their youngest son, Huw. The family live in a mining village at the turn of the century, and through portraying their trials and tribulations, the film also charts the destruction of the environment in the Welsh coalfields and deteriorating conditions for miners.\nBased on the 1939 Richard Llewellyn novel, the film scooped five Oscars, beating Citizen Kane in both the Best Film and Best Director categories.\n                                            15. 1943: Mrs Miniver                                        \nSet in a fictional English town, Mrs Miniver charts the effects of World War II on the lives of a rural housewife and her family. Though the men in her life go to war, her son signing up to join the RAF and her husband volunteering to take his boat to the Dunkirk evacuation, the women are still exposed to the conflict when a German pilot parachutes into the garden.\nThe film won six Oscars, including Best Director for Walter Wyler, and earning Walter Pidgeon his first Best Actor nomination.\n                                            16. 1944: Casablanca                                        \nCasablanca is one of the best-loved films in all of cinema, and its denouement is one of the most quoted. Set in December 1941, the month Pearl Harbour pitched the United States into the Second World War, Humphrey Bogart's cynical bar owner rediscovers his lost political ideals when Ingrid Bergman, the woman he loved, and loves, walks into his gin-joint with a legendary resistance hero. Meanwhile, the movie features some of the finest character actors of the era.\n                                            17. 1945: Going My Way                                        \nWartime America just adored this heartwarming tale of two country priests, and critics were as satisfied. Complete with singalongs from Bing Crosby, who took the Best Actor Oscar for his appearance, Going My Way won big during awards season. The film is about a young priest taking over a parish from an established old veteran, and went on to become the top-grossing release of the year ($6.5 million).\n                                            18. 1946: The Lost Weekend                                        \nThe Lost Weekend is a frank, taboo-breaking examination of alcohol addiction, which follows the life of a chronic alcoholic-cum-failed novelist (Phillip Terry) over the course of a long weekend.\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). It was Billy Wilder's fourth directorial effort, after The Major and the Minor (1942), Five Graves to Cairo (1943), and the classic film noir Double Indemnity (1944).\n                                            19. 1947: The Best Years of Our Lives                                        \nProducer Samuel Goldwyn's classic American film is about the trauma and social displacement experienced by a group of returning veteran servicemen (Harold Russell, Frederic March, Dana Andrews) following World War II. Unemployment, adultery, and alcoholism plague their lives in this bitingly-ironic film title.\nIt sold approximately 55 million tickets in the United States, which equates to a gross of $24 million and remains the sixth most-attended film of all time in the UK, with over 20 million admissions registered.\n                                            20. 1948: Gentleman's Agreement                                        \nAdapted from Laura Z. Hobson's bestselling novel of the same name, Gentleman's Agreement tackles the subject of ingrained anti-semitism in America. When widowed journalist Philip Green (Gregory Peck) moves to New York City with his son and mother he is asked to research people's prejudices against Jews, and adopts a Jewish identity for himself and his family.\nNoticing the difference in treatment he receives, and growing more aware of bigotry toward others, he reevaluates his own accepted ideals.\nGentleman's Agreement won three Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director (Elia Kazan) and Best Supporting Actress (Celeste Holm).\n                                            21. 1949: Hamlet                                        \nWhat better film to take Britain's first Academy Award for Best Picture? Sir Laurence Olivier held his audience's attention in his multiple capacity as producer, director, and adaptor of Shakespeare's play.\nBut it was Larry's performance in the most coveted role in all of acting which made history. He doesn't stop there. Did you know that Hamlet's father's ghost is him, too: his voice slowed down by a tape recorder?\n                                            22. 1950: All the King's Men                                        \nA small-town man with big ideas, Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) rises from self-taught lawyer to champion of his local people to State Governor. But on the way he loses what originally set him apart from the ruthless politicians he hated in his early, idealistic days. Corrupt himself, and disloyal to those who are most loyal to him, he tries to defend himself against those who would see him fall.\nAdapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren, John Wayne  famously turned down the lead role, which meant that Broderick Crawford beat him to Best Actor when the awards came round.\n                                            23. 1951: All About Eve                                        \nFollowing the advancement of aspiring actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) from fan girl to golden girl, the people she has crossed gather to watch her accept an award.\nThis arch comedy about ambition in the theatre world garnered 14 Oscar Nominations, which would remain a record until Titanic came along in 1997.\nAnd had the Academy given awards to collective female casts, All About Eve would no doubt have picked up one for its combination of Baxter, Bette Davis, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe. It is still the only film to have secured nominations for four of its actresses.\n                                            24. 1952: An American in Paris                                        \nA fully technicolour musical based on a score by George Gershwin, An American in Paris would certainly have been a sensory spectacle of the highest order. Three aspiring artists and musicians try to make names for themselves in Paris, with Gene Kelly playing Jerry, an American WWII veteran turned struggling painter.\nOne day he is picked up by a wealthy society belle (Nina Foch) who wishes to offer him more than just patronage, while Jerry falls for a girl he doesn't even know.\n                                            25. 1953: The Greatest Show on Earth                                        \n\"We bring you the circus...\" opens Cecil B. DeMille's large-scale technicolour, and bring it they did. The film featured the whole of Ringling bros and Barnum and Bailey's Circus troupe, comprising 1400 people, hundreds of animals and over 50 cartloads of equipment and tents. General manager Brad (Charlton Heston) finds himself in a tricky love triangle when he hires The Great Sebastian (Cornel Wilde) to replace his girlfriend Holly (Betty Hutton) in centre-ring.\nThe film caused controversy by winning Best Picture over films such as Ivanhoe, High Noon and Singin' in the Rain.\n                                            26. 1954: From Here to Eternity                                        \nSet in 1941 in the months leading up to Pearl Harbour, this military drama won eight Oscars of 13 nominations. Montgomery Clift stars as Private Robert E. Lee Prewett, a recent transfer to a barracks in Hawaii. When he refuses to join the regiment's boxing club, the captain sets out to punish him into submission, assisted by First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster). Prewitt only has the support of his friend Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra ).\n                                            27. 1955: On the Waterfront                                        \nSeen as the summit of his early movie career, Marlon Brando's portrayal of longshoreman Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront won him his first Oscar. The film, about Terry's struggle to stand against the corruption and mob control in the New Jersey docks where he works, also debuted Eva Marie Saint and earned Elia Kazan his second Best Director award.\nProduced at the height of HUACs investigation of Hollywood, many saw the film (which explores the nature of testimony) as an attempt by Kazan to justify his decision to name communist affiliates in the House.\n                                            28. 1956: Marty                                        \nErnest Borgnine plays lovelorn butcher Marty; 34, still living at home and under pressure from his parents to get married. His fortunes change when he meets school-teacher Clara (Betsy Blair) in a Bronx dancehall.\nThis neat and compact character study, adapted from writer Paddy Cheyefski's original TV drama takes place over a very short time-frame of a little over 24 hours, and won Cheyefsky best screenplay. Delbert Mann and Borgnine also received Best Director and Best Actor awards for their roles in the film.\n                                            29. 1957: Around the World in 80 Days                                        \nLike most films of the era, Around the World in 80 Days was a mammoth production, oozing American glamour, with over 40 cameos from the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward, Frank Sinatra and Buster Keaton.\nDavid Niven stars as the unflappable hero of Jules Verne's 1873 novel, assisted by the comedic butler Passepartout (played by prolific Mexican comedian Cantinflas).\nProducer Michael Todd claimed they shot in every location featured in the film, and the picture was touted as a chance for audience to admire exotic locales. Interestingly, the iconic flight by hydrogen balloon was not a feature in Verne's novel.\n                                            30. 1958: The Bridge on the River Kwai                                        \nAs part of a tourism drive in 2014, Sri Lanka rebuilt the replica bridge destroyed in an iconic scene from The Bridge on the River Kwai. In the film, the titular bridge is constructed by a band of British prisoners of war during World War II, who are ordered to do so to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway.\nAlec Guinness delivers a poignant performance as Colonel Nicholson, an honourable but vain man in charge of the POWs. From a budget of $2.8 million, the movie took $30.6 million on its first release.\n                                            31. 1959: Gigi                                        \nMaurice Chevalier thanked heaven for little girls, and we got a case of \"right director, wrong film\", as Vincente Minnelli's stupidly lavish Parisian tuner won all the votes, and his far superior melodrama Some Came Running got left out of the, well, running.\nAs with many of Minnelli's musicals, Gigi fulfilled the important winning criteria: an original score, well-sketched characters, and a bittersweet romance. The film is considered the last great MGM musical.\n                                            32. 1960: Ben-Hur                                        \nSomehow the makers of the first Ben-Hur film, a silent movie from 1907, condensed all the action into a nine-minute one-reeler. The 1959 remake (there was another in 1926) was a landmark achievement in grand biblical storytelling for the cinema, and lasts three hours and 32 minutes.\nBen-Hur was the most expensive film ever made at the time, costing $15 million to shot in Technicolour. Its success ultimately saved MGM Studios from bankruptcy.\n                                            33. 1961: The Apartment                                        \nBack in 1960, to see someone on screen portraying genuine everyman anxiety - ie, not the camped-up Jerry Lewis kind - must have been something rather odd and special.\nIn Billy Wilder's darker-than-it-seems romantic comedy, Jack Lemmon (as CC Baxter) turns common-or-garden nerves into a revolutionary form of acting, his doleful stares and wildly gesticulating hands making for a mesmerising two hours, incorporating the subtlest kind of comic genius.\n                                            34. 1962: West Side Story                                        \nIt's impossible to begrudge the vertiginous energy and feeling that make West Side Story one of the great American musicals, and one radically told through dance.\nJerome Robbins's legendary choreography needs the biggest screen it can get; when the movie's firing on all cylinders of music, lyrics and motion (twice: \"America\" and \"Gee, Officer Krupke\") there's little to touch it.\nThe film, set in 1950s blue-collar New York City, won 10 Oscars in total, claiming everything from Best Picture to Best Costume Design.\n                                            35. 1963: Lawrence of Arabia                                        \nDavid Lean and Sap Spiegel's epic, as well as being the inspiration for modern greats such as Steven Spielberg , George Lucas  and Martin Scorsese, is credited by most institutions and polls as one of the best films ever made.\nFamed for its beautiful desert scenes and its central performance by Peter O'Toole, it is also, at 227 minutes, the longest film ever to win an Oscar for Best Picture.\nA biopic of the controversial war hero T. E. Lawrence, it shows his progress from outspoken and learned intelligence officer to saviour of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire during WWI.\n                                            36. 1964: Tom Jones                                        \nHenry Fielding's bawdy 18th century epic is considered one of the first true novels, and this raucous adaptation was one of the most successful comedies of its day.\nEccentric, too: it was noted for its unique mixture of cinematic techniques such as voice-over, silent-film set pieces and actors addressing the camera.\nWrongfully kicked out of his home, the wayward but good-intentioned orphan Tom Jones (Albert Finney) travels to London to find his fortune, but on the way must negotiate bandits, the law, high-society intrigue, and a liaison with someone who might be his long-lost mother.\n                                            37. 1965: My Fair Lady                                        \nMy Fair Lady, which sees cockney flower-seller Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) transformed into a gentlewoman by elocution teacher Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), is lodged in our popular consciousness.\nBased on a musical update of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, it broached the subjects of class and the relation between the sexes.\nHarrison took Best Actor for a role he had played since the inception of the original stage version, and musical numbers such as On the Street Where You Live and I Could Have Danced All Night remain classics to this day.\n                                            38. 1966: The Sound of Music                                        \nNothing is more evocative of the musical genre than Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, here made famous by Robert Wise's picture. Maria, a nun struggling to make a go of the religious life, becomes governess to a widowed naval captain's children, teaching them the value of music before the Nazis invade Austria.\nThe movie starring the legendary Julie Andrews won five Oscars and became the highest grossing film in history at the time, knocking Gone with the Wind off the top spot. Taking into account the standards of the day, it is the fifth highest grossing film of all time.\n                                            39. 1967: A Man for All Seasons                                        \nFred Zinnemann's screen adaptation of Robert Bolt's acclaimed play about Sir Thomas More was an Oscars smash, winning six awards, including Best Director for Zinnemann and Best Actor for Paul Scofield, who had played More since the theatre version.\nOnce a beloved advisor and teacher to Henry VIII, More disagrees with his king over the divorce of his wife Catherine of Arragon. As Henry establishes the Church of England, he remains true to his Catholic conscience, refusing to recognise the King's religious authority, and eventually dies for his principles.\nAs well as making More a saint after his death, the Vatican unsurprisingly classes this among the greatest films of all time.\n                                            40. 1968: In the Heat of the Night                                        \nNorman Jewison's dramatic portrayal of racism and murder in the American South stars Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs, Philadelphia's top homicide detective. While on a visit to Sparta, MS, Tibbs is arrested on general principles in the murder investigation of a prominent white businessman. On his identity being established, he is recruited to help the small-town team solve the crime.\nAt the time, having a non-white actor in a lead role was so controversial that the crew couldn't actually film in the Deep South, and instead recreated sets in Illinois and Tennessee. Despite this, the film was a triumph with critics, beating The Graduate to Best Picture.\n                                            41. 1969: Oliver!                                        \nThe musical adaptation of Dickens' witty classic won five Oscars of six nominations, including Best Art Direction, and Best Musical Score for Johnny Green's arrangement of the broadway soundtrack. On escaping from the workhouse, orphan Oliver runs away to London, and is welcomed into Fagin's gang of young pickpockets.\nStarring Ron Moody as Fagin, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. It was the last musical film to win Best Picture until Chicago 34 years later in 2002.\n                                            42. 1970: Midnight Cowboy                                        \nThe only X-rated film to ever win Best Picture, Midnight Cowboy follows the journey of Joe Buck, a young Texan dishwasher who travels to New York in an attempt to make money as a 'hustler'. Selling himself on the streets to little avail, he meets seasoned con-artist Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and the pair strike up a working relationship.\nRatso's name would later be lent to Jim Henson's wise-cracking muppet Rizzo the Rat.\nThe film won Best Director for John Schlesinger and Waldo Salt scooped Best Screenplay for his adaptation of James Leo Herlihy's 1965 novel of the same name.\n                                            43. 1971: Patton                                        \nSubtitled 'A Salute to a Rebel', Patton is a portrait of the flamboyant, and outspoken American military general George S. Patton, (played by George C. Scott) who is described in the film as \"a magnificent anachronism\".\nThe plot follows his army career throughout World-War Two, from his leadership in Casablanca to the fall of the Third Reich. With his loud and colourful language and unabashed love of battle, Patton was a controversial figure, but one who very much suited the high-budget Hollywood war-film treatment.\nThe film won Francis Ford Coppola his first Oscar for Best Screenplay based on fact, and 6 other awards including Best Picture.\n                                            44. 1972: The French Connection                                        \nGene Hackman plays short-tempered cop Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle in this fast-paced action thriller directed by William Friedkin. Along with his partner Buddy Russo (Roy Schneider), Doyle tails two French nationals to intercept a large shipment of heroin.\nThe film is inspired by the late 60s and early 70s drug trade, when swathes of illegal heroin in the East Coast was smuggled in via France. Doyle and Russo were based on real life narcotics detectives.\nThe film is perhaps most notable for the famous car chase in which Popeye chases an elevated subway train. Winning 5 Oscars, the film proved popular with both the critics and the box office.\n                                            45. 1973: The Godfather                                        \nPresenting producer Albert S. Ruddy's The Godfather with a Best Picture Oscar was an offer the Academy couldn't refuse.\nBased on Puzo's eponymous best-selling novel, The Godfather is - with the possible exception of Goodfellas - the greatest and most influential film in the gangster genre. In 2007, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as second in their \"greatest films of all time list\", behind only Citizen Kane.\n                                            46. 1974: The Sting                                        \nIn the pantheon of great male cinematic double acts, Robert Redford and Paul Newman are up there with Laurel and Hardy.  So memorable was their on-screen chemistry, it's easy to forget they only appeared in two films together.\nTheir first collaboration, the lyrical, vaguely comic western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), was directed by George Roy Hill and saw Redford and Newman pour charisma into their roles as insouciant outlaws.\nTheir next film was even better. A crafty, good-natured crime caper, The Sting (1973) reunited Hill with Redford and Newman and won seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n                                            47. 1975: The Godfather Part II                                        \nThe Godfather is great, but director Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather: Part II is greater. It's that rare thing - a sequel that doesn't just match but actually surpasses the original film.\nNot content with just recycling the same story, Part II illuminates and elaborates on the first part, adding a classically tragic dimension by using flashbacks to show the origins of the Corleone family, and then moving forward in time to show that same family ripping itself apart.\n                                            48. 1976: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest                                        \nBeautiful, devastating and hilarious, Milos Forman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's classic novel is the ultimate \"buck the system\" movie. When smooth-talking prisoner Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson ) cons his way into a mental asylum to ride out his sentence, he hasn't bargained on the despotic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).\nMcMurphy refuses to tow the line, showing inmates that they're \"no crazier than the average asshole on the streets\", which leads to a battle of wills in which there can be only one winner.\n                                            49. 1977: Rocky                                        \nThe film that broke Sylvester \"Sly\" Stallone's career as a Hollywood's hottest property for macho leads was the highest grossing movie of 1976, racking up $225 million at the box office.\nThree decades later, and 16 years after Rocky V, Stallone was tempted to reprise his role as boxer Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa in 2006's lazily titled Rocky Balboa, and again in 2015 with Creed, which saw Stallone nominated for Best Supporting Actor.\n                                            50. 1978: Annie Hall                                        \nAnnie Hall marks Woody Allen's  departure from simple farces to what we now think of as a classic Woody Allen movie: a mixture of hilarity, philosophy and self-annihilation.\nAlvy Singer (Allen) is trying to work out what went wrong with his last girlfriend Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), and in so doing looks back into his own childhood and attempts to rewrite their relationship.\nIt picked up four Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards ceremony, including Best Director and Screenplay for Allen, and Best Actress for Keaton. The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw calls it the best comedy film of all time.\n                                            51. 1979: The Deer Hunter                                        \nEvocative and distressing in equal measure, The Deer Hunter is often hailed by the critics as an American epic in the same class as The Godfather films. In an iconic, exuberant opening section, a tight-knit group of Russian-American friends celebrate together, looking forward to enlisting in the Vietnam war.\nThe ensuing action shows, in another string of iconic scenes involving gambling halls and Russian roulette, what war does to them.\nWith a memorable soundtrack including Frankie Valli and a theme played by classical guitar legend John Williams, and a stellar cast featuring Robert De Niro , Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep  and John Cazale, The Deer Hunter picked up four Oscars.\n                                            52. 1980: Kramer vs Kramer                                        \nA touching film which focuses on the other side of family life, Kramer vs Kramer examines divorce and the impact for all involved. Ambitious ad-man Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is left alone to raise his son Billy after his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) announces that she is leaving them.\nInitially a struggle, over time Ted reevaluates his priorities and the father and son become close. But when Joanna returns over a year later to take Billy, the two Kramers battle for custody.\nBoth Kramers, it turns out, won Oscars. The film won five in all.\n                                            53. 1981: Ordinary People                                        \nRobert Redford's directorial debut earned him an Oscar, and dealt with a family's grief in its various manifestations. The Jarretts, a well-to-do family living in Chicago, lost their favourite son on a boating accident. While the younger son Conrad spends time in psychiatric hospital and blames himself, his mother denies it ever happened.\nWhile most of the leads in the film received Oscar nominations or awards (Timothy Hutton got Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Conrad), Donald Sutherland didn't for his role as the father, Calvin, which was seen as bad form.\n                                            54. 1982: Chariots of Fire                                        \n\"The British are coming\" announced screenwriter Colin Welland as he won his Oscar for Chariots of Fire, a rousing classic about more British winners.\nCelebrating the success of the 1924 Olympics running team, it follows the path of two passionate athletes: Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish Cambridge student who finds in running a weapon against prejudice, and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a Christian Scotsman who feels God when he runs.\nSince it was released, people have been imagining Vangelis' famous soundtrack whenever they see something in slow motion.\n                                            55. 1983: Gandhi                                        \nA biopic of Gandhi's life was Richard Attenborough's dream project, and this film was the final result of two previous unfinished attempts, making the whole project a labour of nearly 18 years.\nThe film introduces us to Mohandas K. Gandhi (played by Ben Kingsley in his second ever feature film role) as an English law student who forsakes all his worldly possessions to promote the cause of Indian independence from the British.\nThe film won Attenborough both Best Picture and Director as well as five other awards and a further three nominations.\n                                            56. 1984: Terms of Endearment                                        \nSimpson's producer James L. Brooks' cinematic debut charting the complex relationship between Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Debra Winger) was the second highest grossing film of that year, being pipped only (although quite substantially!) by Return of the Jedi.\nJack Nicholson won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as ex-astronaut Garrett Breedlove, while MacLaine and Winger both garnered Best Actress nominations for their performances, MacLaine taking the trophy in the end.\n                                            57. 1985: Amadeus                                        \nAn adaptation of the hit broadway production, the film reflects on the events leading to the death of prodigal musician Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart's arch rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls his sabotage from his current residence of an asylum.\nThe film garnered 11 nominations, winning 7, including Best Director for Milos Forman. In opposition to the legend, Salieri pipped Mozart at this awards season, with Murray Abraham clinching the Best Actor Oscar over Tom Hulce who played the role of Mozart.\n                                            58. 1986: Out of Africa                                        \nMeryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen-Flecke, a Danish woman who moves to a plantation in a British East Africa with her new husband Bror (Klaus Maria Brandauer). Left to her own devices on a farm which is largely neglected by Bror, she meets and develops a close relationship with local hunter Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford).\nThe film is based on a Karen's memoir, published under the pseudonym of Isak Dinesen.\nThe soundtrack won John Barry his third Best Music Oscar, while Sidney Pollack scooped Best Director, although Streep missed out on Best Actress, pipped by Geraldine Page.\n                                            59. 1987: Platoon                                        \nDescribed as the first real movie about the war in Vietnam, Platoon drew on director Oliver Stone's own experiences as an infantry soldier in Vietnam. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) drops out of college to volunteer in the US army, and is sent with a platoon of other young soldiers to fight in Vietnam, where he quickly loses the innocent view of war he held before he left home.\nWillem Dafoe and Tom Berenger both received nominations for their roles as violent and ruthless commander sgt. Barnes (Berenger) and good-natured but utterly disenchanted sgt. Elias (Dafoe).\n                                            60. 1988: The Last Emperor                                        \nBernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor surveys the story of a man who is shackled by his past. The Chinese Emperor Pu Yi (John Lone) inherits the throne as a little boy and is forced to live incarcerated in the Forbidden City. This is a profound film about how politics can affect not only the masses, but an unusual person too. It won nine Academy Awards.\n                                            61. 1989: Rain Man                                        \nProbably the most famous fictional savant is Raymond, Dustin Hoffman's character in the 1988 film Rain Man. Raymond was based on a real-life person called Kim Peek who, despite having an IQ measuring just 72 (below normal), had a stunning memory.\nRain Man was heralded by viewers and critics alike, winning the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin Film Festival, four Academy Awards, and taking $350 million at the box office.\n                                            62. 1990: Driving Miss Daisy                                        \nBased on Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Driving Miss Daisy traces the quarter-century long relationship between a Black chauffeur, Hoke (Morgan Freeman) and a matriarchal Southerner Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy).\nThis is a complex and compelling portrait of old age, dealing with the thorny issue of race. It received nine nominations, winning four for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Makeup, and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n                                            63. 1991: Dances With Wolves                                        \nEpic, sprawling 181-minute films don't tend to be the stuff of Best Picture winners, though star actor-cum-director Kevin Costner's filmmaking debut was not your average blockbuster.\nSet in the 1860s, Dances with Wolves ostensibly follows Costner's First Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, who is wounded in the midst of the American Civil War, yet it contains much more: with a relatively frugal $19 million budget, the film features 300 horses, 3,500 buffalo, 250 Native Americans, 150 cavalry, and 48 speaking roles.\n                                            64. 1992: The Silence of the Lambs                                        \nThe Silence of the Lambs won all 'Big Five' Academy Awards at the 1992 Oscar ceremony and was one of the biggest grossing films of 1991 thanks in part to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's adaptation of Thomas Harris' second Hannibal Lecter novel.\nIt was the performances of the two lead actors though-Jodie Foster, and in particular, Anthony Hopkins as Lecter-which really grabbed the imagination and eventually earned the movie, after a slow start, widespread acclaim.\n                                            65. 1993: Unforgiven                                        \nStarring, produced and directed by Clint Eastwood , Unforgiven ranks fourth in the American Film Institute's best Westerns of all time. When a sex worker is attacked by two cowboys in the town of Big Whisky, a bounty is put on their heads. William Munny (Eastwood), a one-time outlaw, takes himself out of retirement for one last job.\nThe film was intended to be a last hurrah before Eastwood stopped creating Westerns, but the old gunslinger returned in 2014 with the controversial American Sniper, a traditional Western set on the battlegrounds of the Middle East.\n                                            66. 1994: Schindler's List                                        \nSteven Spielberg's masterpiece about Nazi Poland almost had another director. Though interested in the real life story of Oskar Schindler, he didn't believe he was ready to tackle the subject matter, and tried to pass it on to other directors. How lucky for us that none of the other possibilities took it!\nSchindler (Liam Neeson ), a wealthy Nazi businessman, comes to Krak\u00f3w to set up a munitions factory, employing cheap labour from the city's Jewish ghetto. When an SS overseer (Ralph Fiennes ) is ordered to move Jews to a concentration camp, Schindler witnesses the extent of Nazi brutality, and begins to devote himself to keeping as many Jews alive as possible.\nThe American Film Institute puts it in the top ten greatest American films.\n                                            67. 1995: Forrest Gump                                        \nThis epic begins with a man sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus and telling strangers his life story. The man is Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks ), eminently quotable for a generation of cinema-goers, and his life features cameos from some of the century's leading figures, from Richard Nixon and JFK to Elvis and John Lennon.\nA boy of below average intelligence with a good heart, he discovers early that he is a naturally gifted athlete, and later makes a brave soldier in Vietnam.\nThe film took six Oscars and to this day divides critics, with half finding it heart-warming, and others finding it a little too sentimental.\n                                            68. 1996: Braveheart                                        \nAfter the Medieval King of England Edward I's conquest of Scotland, English lords took increasing liberties over the Scottish people. After his wife was executed for refusing to sleep with an English lord, William Wallace takes vengeance, and becomes a beacon of hope to Scottish patriots.\nThough famously taking many liberties with historical fact, this epic boosted tourism to Scotland, and even increased Scottish people's engagement with that period of their history.\n                                            69. 1997: The English Patient                                        \nBased on the Booker Prize-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, The English Patient won nine Academy Awards.\nSet in Italy during WWII, it explores the relationship of a French-Canadian nurse (Juliette Binoche) to her badly disfigured patient, Count Laszlo de Alm\u00e1sy (Ralph Fiennes) who relives his memories of the war in a series of flashbacks.\nThe author was consulted by the film editor Walter Murch on how to achieve the complex play between timeframes, spawning a book based on these conversations.\n                                            70. 1998: Titanic                                        \nJames Cameron's epic romantic disaster film set on the ill-fated british passenger liner RMS Titanic stood as the most popular film in box office history, grossing over $2 billion. It was only topped by Cameron himself, with Avatar in 2009.\nThe all-conquering tragic romance between Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Leonardo DiCaprio  and Kate Winslet) was an entirely fictionalised account, however there was a J. Dawson aboard the original ship.\nIt won 11 Oscars, tying with Ben-Hur (1959) and Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King (2003) as the most Oscars won for a single film.\n                                            71. 1999: Shakespeare in Love                                        \nJohn Madden's romantic comedy about William Shakespeare  stars Joseph Fiennes as the struggling poet and playwright searching for a muse. This he finds in the form of Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a passionate actor auditioning for all-male casts in the guise of Thomas Kent.\nThe eighth British film to ever win Best Picture, it featured Judi Dench as Elizabeth I and Colin Firth as Lord Wessex. It scooped 7 Oscars in all, with Paltrow and Dench securing best actress and supporting actress.\n                                            72. 2000: American Beauty                                        \nSam Mendes' suburban drama starring Kevin Spacey  as a father in the grips of a midlife crisis makes him the most recent of only six directors to ever win Best Picture on their cinematic debut.\nLester Burnham (Spacey), ever more depressed and estranged from family life, becomes infatuated with his daughter's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari).\nThe film won five Oscars including Best Actor for Kevin Spacey, and beat The Green Mile to Best Picture.\n                                            73. 2001: Gladiator                                        \nRussell Crowe  plays Maximus, a Roman army general in the year 180. The subsequent chaos after the death of Marcus Aurelius leads to him being sentenced to execution, and losing all his wealth and status. He escapes and becomes a gladiator, determined to avenge himself against Aurelius' son and return himself to his former glory.\nThe epic production was a hit at the worldwide box office, being topped only by Mission Impossible: II.\n                                            74. 2002: A Beautiful Mind                                        \nBased loosely on the biography of nobel-prize winning mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., A Beautiful Mind charts his meteoric rise and initial promise studying at Princeton in the 1940s, to his Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994. In between he suffers highs and lows, dealing with his asocial tendencies and schizophrenia.\nJennifer Connelly won Best Supporting actress for her role as his student and later wife, Alicia, and the film earned Ron Howard his first Best Director Oscar.\n                                            75. 2003: Chicago                                        \nDirector Rob Marshall's Chicago is a hard-edged Prohibition-era city far from the one depicted in High Fidelity two years before. Killers on the run Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), however, charm their way to the top - and away from death row - by becoming Vaudeville stars.\nAdapted by screenwriter Bill Condon, Chicago won six Academy Awards in 2003, including Best Picture (the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1969).\n                                            76. 2004: The Lord of the Rings-Return of the King                                        \nThe Lord of the Rings trilogy was probably the greatest gamble in filmmaking history. Executives at New Line Cinema risked the entire studio by giving Peter Jackson - a New Zealander known mainly for a handful of zombie films and the real-life drama Heavenly Creatures - $300 million and a free hand to make all three films at once.\nThe denouement to JRR Tolkien's trilogy, however, turned out to be Jackson's favourite, and the one that finally scooped a Best Picture Oscar for its troubles.\n                                            77. 2005: Million Dollar Baby                                        \nActor-director Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie Dunn, a virtuoso veteran trainer, who one day takes on pocket-rocket Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank).

It was not immediately considered an Oscar contender due to its graphic violent content, though many credited its heavyweight PR campaign for the eventual victory (the film's budget was $90 million).\n                                            80. 2008: No Country for Old Men                                        \nThis Coen Brothers film, for many critics, established the directors as among the very best. Shot in the arid badlands of Texas, it is an up-to-date incarnation of the Western.\nAfter stumbling across a bag of money, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hunted by the assassin Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one of the scariest characters in modern cinema, who flips a coin to decide whether he will kill people he meets along the way.\nWatching it, for many, was a truly gripping and unsettling experience, leading some to say that Alfred Hitchcock himself couldn't have made it more menacing.\n                                            81. 2009: Slumdog Millionaire                                        \nHaving done brilliantly on the gameshow Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Jamal (Dev Patel), a teenage boy from the slums of Mumbai, must prove he hasn't cheated. Questioned by police backstage before the final question, he details how he knows every answer, and in explaining tells the story of his life: from picking pockets, his gangster brother who worked his way out of the slums, and the love of his life.\nDanny Boyle's film met praise across the board from audiences, though many Indian critics found it patronising, saying it showcased only the bad parts of Mumbai and Indian cinema.\n                                            82. 2010: The Hurt Locker                                        \n\"Every time you suit up,\" says one bomb disposal expert to another, \"it's life or death.\"\nSergeant First Class William James is brought in to head up an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in Iraq after his predecessor is blown up.

He is persuaded to see a speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), and so begins an unlikely and life-long friendship.\nVeteran Hollywood screenwriter David Seidler tracked down the son of Logue and was shown his notebooks, but in order to write about what he found he needed permission from the Queen Mother, who requested that he wait till after her death. This uplifting film bagged a Best Actor award for English darling Colin Firth.\n                                            84. 2012: The Artist                                        \nThe Artist is a modern silent film, depicting the point in the late Twenties when silent films fell out of vogue.

About an underemployed family of hustlers who inveigle themselves into a posh home to escape from their working class backgrounds, the movie is set in two houses.\nThe first is where the Kim family - father, mother, son and daughter - live. Half the tiny apartment is below the road, and the other is above. This allows the foursome to be seen by, and to see, the public. There is no privacy, naturally, in this hovel, and every night they watch drunks urinate on the wall opposite, and can do little about it except yell and fight. When it rains and the road floods, the water, and the sewage along with it, pours in. It is a miserable existence and they are desperate to earn regular money and move to a better place.\nThrough a contact of the son, Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the family engineer themselves, one by one, into the employment of the wealthy Park family - also father, mother, son and daughter - who live in a rich neighbourhood of the city. The house is a stunner, built, we are told, by an architect called 'Namgoong'. This is fiction, of course, and in reality it is a set, built by the director and production designer.\nThe house has a manicured garden that you can view through a massive, single pane of glass, along with a glass door. The bedrooms are upstairs, but there is another secret level to the house, a cellar, more like Hitler's self sufficient bunker in his last days in Berlin, that the ubiquitous 'Namgoong' apparently built to stay safe from a possible North Korean nuclear attack.\nThe film is funny, sad and unpredictable in narrative, but too obviously schematic in design. The storied architecture of the sets explains the skewed class structure of South Korea, and indeed any nation that has turned capitalist with a vengeance. A small percentage of the population controls almost all the wealth, and most people, like the Kims, live in poverty.\nThe rich Parks can afford to employ them; as driver, housekeeper and tutors to their children. But once in this luxurious and beautifully decorated home, the servants are left free to exercise a moral code. Do they remain exploited, with wages that are a tiny fraction of that earned by their corporate employers? Do they allow themselves to be hired and fired on a whim, tossed out into the rain without social security? Or do they turn parasite, and feed on those who feed them?\nDirector Bong Joon-ho loads his film with allegories and symbols - the internet versus morse code, the scholar's rock versus the murderer's rock, books versus paintings, sex versus death, ghost versus reality, North versus South Korea - that gives 'Parasite' the kinetic energy that keeps you engrossed. But it also has the effect of turning the movie into a self conscious work. This takes away from the naturalism of an earlier engrossing movie by this gifted director - 'Memories of Murder' - a film about the social and political impact of a serial killer in Korea.\nStill, 'Parasite' is a recommended watch."}, {"text": "Oct 31, 2019( Louis Proyect: The Unrepentant Marxist: http://louisproyect.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Play Video[1]A month ago, I asked my NYFCO colleague Avi Offer if he could recommend any films that might pass muster for our year-end awards given my stringent standards. Avi is generally pretty sharp. For example, he wrote about Tarantino's 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood': 'If Tarantino had something insightful to say about Hollywood or actors or humanity instead of wasting the audience's time with shots of people's feet and other shallow, dull and boring scenes then the film would be much more powerful, provocative, haunting and even poignant.' I couldn't put it better. \nAfter a minute or so, he told me that 'Parasite' was very good. I told him that I liked Bong Joon Ho's 'The Host' very much but didn't care for later films like 'Snowpiercer' or 'Okja' very much. In fact, I walked out of press screenings for both after about 20 minutes. Since he assured me that 'Parasite' was a return to the high standards of 'The Host', I thought I'd give it a chance. Well, it was better than 'Snowpiercer' or 'Okja' but only in the sense that I walked out of a press screening after 40 minutes this time. This is not meant as a review but only a reaction to what I saw. You can take it with a grain of salt, but for those who tend to agree with my film reviews, this is probably sufficient to warn you off. This is a story about a down-and-out family living in a bug-infested apartment that takes advantage of a super-rich but nave Korean family. The father in the down-and-out family is played by Kang-ho Song, who has been in many Korean films playing a likable but oafish anti-hero. His wife is sort of his female counterpart. They have one male and one female college-aged children, slackers just like the parents. The son's best friend urges him to interview for a tutoring job working with the attractive teen daughter of the rich family since he trusts him not to put the make on her. To help him qualify, his sister uses Photoshop to produce a false credentials establishing him as a college student and tutor. In short order, we learn that the entire family is made up of grifters. On his first day on the job, he manages to sweep the teen daughter of the rich family off her feet. While he is at their opulent townhouse, he notices that her younger brother is an out of control brat with a passion for making ugly self-portraits. This inspires him to recommend his sister for a job as the kid's art therapist, pretending that she is a friend of a friend who has been studying in the USA. She uses Photoshop to create phony credentials for herself as well and manages to con the mother into hiring her but at a top dollar. Understanding that the mother is an easy con, they conspire to replace the family chauffeur with their father and the long-time housekeeper with the mom. To get the current chauffeur fired, the sister pulls off her panties as he is driving her home and leaves it on the floor of the back seat, the intention being to make it look like he has been having sex on the job. This is now about 30 minutes into the film and I am starting to feel restless. The rich people are patsies and the poor people are there to suck them dry. Like parasites, I suppose. Of all the characters I have seen to that point, none are likable. In fact, they are uniformly repellent. The straw that broke the camel's back was how they got rid of the housekeeper. After they learned that she was allergic to peaches, they began shaving off the fuzz from peaches and dropping them on the back of her neck when she wasn't looking. The fuzz made her have huge coughing attacks, kind of like the bronchitis that has been hobbling me until 3 or 4 days ago. When she goes to a clinic to get treated, the poor family's father takes a photo of her there and informs the rich family's father that she has TB just to get her fired. I sat in my plush screening room seat and scratched my head. Peach fuzz causing coughing attacks? WTF? And she is going to be fired without the rich family giving her the right to show them the results of a test from the clinic that would certainly not indicate TB? I tried to picture myself as a producer working on the film and reading the script. I'd ask Bong Joon Ho how he came up with such a cockamamie plot twist. Needless to say, with his clout he'd find a producer to replace me on the spot. That's the problem with all these celebrated writer/directors like Tarantino and Bong Joon Ho. Nobody has the guts to tell the studio that the emperor is not wearing any clothes. Although I have not seen 'Joker' yet, I have a feeling that the two films have this much in common. They are supposed to be about class warfare but hardly having anything to do with the sort of film a John Sayles or a Gillo Pontecorvo would make. Seeing that 'Parasite' had a fresh rating of 99 percent on Rotten Tomatoes (I won't be posting a review since I walked out), I was curious to see who the dissidents were. Ironically, there were only two and both were members of NYFCO. One was a hard-core Stalinist named Prairie Miller who had (or maybe still has) a show on WBAI where I used to make guest appearances. All that came to an end after I started writing articles supporting the overthrow of Assad. Now she won't even speak to me, even at our yearly awards meeting. In any case, I think she got the film right[2]: Though billed as a kind of South Korean anti-capitalism satire - this eat the rich outing when not eating its own at the bottom of the economic food chain, comes off more as an empty plate A somewhat combo tale of two families and exceedingly twisted prince and the pauper dubious Seoul mates turned sour spree, Parasite plays out as the poverty stricken bottom feeder (literally basement dwellers) Kim clan conspires together to pull off an elaborate scheme posing as hired help at the home of the patrician Park family. All goes well until part of the ploy involving maneuvers to get rid of the existing household workers backfires into over the top mayhem. And as a kind of chaotic both external and internal bloody class warfare ensues. Essentially creating for the amusement of the giddy bourgeois popcorn audience - both consumers and critics - a cinematic 21st century gladiator spree. The other 'rotten' review came from Armond White, the gay African-American conservative who used to be the president of the prestigious NY Film Critics Circle. Later on, he was expelled for heckling Steve McQueen, the director of '12 Years a Slave', at their annual awards meeting. In his review, White denounced the film as 'torture porn.' In my review,[3] I shared White's take: As is the case with 'Django Unchained', McQueen's film is a vehicle for his preoccupations. With Tarantino, these primarily revolve around revenge, a theme common to so many of the Hong Kong gangster or samurai movies that he has absorbed. For McQueen, the chief interest is in depicting pain with some of the most dramatic scenes involving whippings and other forms of punishment. Although I can't stand White's politics, I think he is one of the sharper film critics around. Indeed, despite his rightwing fanaticism, his critique[4] of 'Parasite' overlaps with Miller's: 'Bong wants his politics both ways: targeting and humiliating the wealthy, high-living entrepreneurs while sentimentalizing and sympathizing with the dishonest, corrupt agitators who angle to swindle them.' If I wrote a full review, this is what I would focus on. The totally misanthropic view that both the rich and poor are shit. 'Snowpiercer' was widely acclaimed as a 'radical' film set on a train in which rich and poor, once again, are at each other's throats. In the 20 minutes I sat watching it, I could not detect a shred of leftist politics. Slant Magazine, a source of some of the most insightful film reviews (music, TV as well), was not impressed. The review[5] ended on this note: 'Snowpiercer concludes on a irritatingly reassuring high note that suggests, per usual, that killing one bad man will allow all of falsely indoctrinated society to magically correct itself. The film could be a conservative parody of nave liberal piety, if conservatives were known to exhibit a sense of humor.'

Starring: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam. 15 cert, 132 mins                   \nThe world can seem a very different place depending on the window you're looking out of. Out of their stinkbug and mildew-infested basement apartment, the Kim family sees steel bars. Beyond that, one of Seoul's backstreets - the kind that drunks dive into to relieve themselves. When the street fumigators go by, they leave their windows open so their apartment can be treated for free, even if they nearly choke to death in the process. Then there's the Park family, settled in a quiet suburban home that's halfway between an art installation and a fortress. Half the walls are made of glass, offering a clear view of the acid-green lawn outside and the vegetation that encloses it on all sides. It's a vista of immense serenity, safety, and eerie perfection. \nThe Park patriarch Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) is a tech CEO who's barely home, while his wife Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) is fluttery and fragile. She obsesses over the imagined artistic genius of her son. He specialises in angry, rebellious scribbles. Toy dogs keep appearing out of nowhere. Are they multiplying in secret? \nIt's into this shiny, hollow world that the Kim family try to integrate themselves, after the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is hired as an English-language tutor. He immediately hatches a plan to get the rest of the clan - which comprises his parents, Ki-taek (veteran actor Song Kang-ho) and Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin), as well as his sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) - employed. Their schemes are exhilarating, as clever and intricately plotted as they are mildly preposterous. For much of Bong      \u00a0    Joon-ho's       \u00a0    Parasite, which the director co-wrote with Han Jin-won, the audience is swept up in the heady thrill of the con. We see them forge documents, invent aliases, and carefully rehearse their lines. \n                     But Bong has never made a straightforward film in his life - that's why he's one of the great masters of the cinematic game (his awards recognition is long overdue, with Parasite landing six Oscar nominations). The director's work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He'll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you. As his takes on the monster movie (2006's The Host) and dystopian fantasy (2013's Snowpiercer) already proved, the director has an affinity for genre cinema, but has never felt confined by its rules. Parasite doesn't quite take place in our world, but neither is it fantasy. It happens in a world that would exist if people's desires and motivations weren't stuffed below the surface.\nThe director's always shown an interest in class conflict. The train in Snowpiercer is just one big metaphor for capitalism, after all. But Parasite might be his most intricate examination of the topic so far. The \"parasite\" of the title applies to every character in this film; the rich leech off the poor, who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class. \nEveryone's fixated on transforming into something else: the Kim family give themselves new backstories that involve fancy foreign colleges and elite skill sets. Yeon-gyo is obsessed with American culture (the most capitalist of them all), importing Native American-style toys for her son and declaring he's the next Basquiat. In Parasite, capitalism is an illusion piled onto another illusion, with everyone trampling each other to reach some undefined goal. \nMuch of this story, however, isn't told in words, but in the use of space and the way people move through it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture and fittings so they can all fit. They're a united front in this battle. The Park family, meanwhile, always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame. No wonder they're so weak and easily manipulated. \nBut, be warned: there are no victories in Parasite. And no one gets away scot-free."}, {"text": "Bong Joon Ho has more to say when it comes to \"Parasite\" and he believes a limited television series is the way to do it.\nMoments after the Academy Awards announced four nominations for \"Parasite\" (original screenplay, foreign language film, best director and best picture) the director hopped on the phone with Variety to discuss the film's global success and potential future beyond film.\n\"When I think of a limited series, I really think of it as an expanded film. Like Ingmar Bergman's 'Fanny and Alexander,' you have a three-hour theatrical version and a three-hour TV version. So my goal is to create a high quality an expanded version of 'Parasite,'\" Bong explained via an interpreter.\nThe news that Bong was teaming up with Adam McKay to create the series for HBO, broke in early January.\n\"Adam McKay and       \u00a0    HBO did very well with 'Succession,' to work with these artists who have created great works I would like to actualize this attempt to expand this film and explore all the ideas that I've had from the script writing stage from what could happen in between the scenes through the TV series,\" Bong said.\nBong insists he and McKay haven't decided if the series will be set in South Korea or be an English language adaptation. \"We're still very much in the early stages,\" he said. \"I'll soon meet with Adam to talk about the set up. For now, a lot of things are open.\"\n\"Parasite\" made history this morning when it became the first South Korean movie to be nominated for best picture and best international film. Bong also earned a nod for directoras well original screenplay with Jon Won Han. Jinmo Yang earned a nom for editing while Lee Ha Jun and Cho Won Woo are up for production design.\n\"I didn't create this film for all these nominations but somehow this all happened. I was particularly happy to get the craft nominations for editing and production design,\" Bong said. \"They are all great masters with a long career and I was very happy to see them nominated... We put in so much effort in all departments for this film. We tried to approach it with mastery and artistry and with new challenges and not remain complacent and I think the voters really recognized that as fellow filmmakers.\"\nMore from Variety\nWhat to Watch on TV This Week: 'The New Pope' and 'Sex Education' Return      \u00a0    HBO's 'Avenue 5' Starring Hugh Laurie: TV Review      \u00a0    'Parasite' Makes History With Oscar Nominations"}, {"text": "In light of the incoming 92nd Academy Awards on Feb. 9, Bong Joon-ho's \"Parasite\" has caught attention as not just the only foreign nominee for Best Picture, but the first Korean nominee ever considered for the award. The film's six Oscars nominations speak to its historic success, cementing Joon-ho's work as a masterpiece.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe title of the movie is somewhat misleading. Labeled as a thriller by cinemas, \"Parasite\" appears simply to be about an infectious disease. But as the movie evolves, the name reveals itself to be but a metaphor.\n\"Parasite\" follows the footsteps of two families, the Kims and the Parks, representing two opposite classes in every society. The Parks are so rich that they do not know how many rooms there are in their house; the Kims are so poor that they sit in their bathroom to catch Wi-Fi from a nearby caf\u00e9. Destiny somehow connects the two together, leading to the least expected events for both families.\nIn every scene, Joon-ho uses this striking parallel narrative to emphasize the social status among members of two families. Their discrepancies are delicately depicted through their encounters. Characters rarely talk about their wealth gap, but every line is a blast for viewers. My favorite line is Mrs. Kim's comment on the Parks: \"There are no good and rich people. They are good because they are rich.\"\nJust as two families' lives are extremely different, \"Parasite's\" first and second halves take very different tones. The first half is what every viewer can expect of a satirical comedy. The Kims bring the playful element to the film with their ridiculously crafty plan and dark jokes. But it is just the set-up for the latter half. The tone changes completely as more secrets are revealed, leading to a bloody ending, reminding me of the Oscars-winning \"American Beauty\" by Sam Mendes.\nThe brilliancy of \"Parasite\" lies in the plot. The film's storyline is so incredibly cohesive that all the details are connected with and complementary to each other. Even simple things like Mr. Park's cup of coffee or the dim light bulb tell a story. This is the artistry that makes the film both overdramatic and logical at the same time.\n\"Parasite's\" sensational story is paired with an equally impressive cast. Lee Sun Kyung, Choi Woo-shik, and Kang Ho-song all make their roles memorable, but for me, the most stunning performance is by Park So-dam as Kim Ki-Jung. Her character is so mysterious that even by the end of the film, her intentions are ambiguous. Her acts are full of conflict of confusion: lighting a cigarette underwater, or smiling in life-threatening situations. Her intricacy and unpredictability reflect that of the entire film\nAlong with the cast, music in the film contributes to its success. Beautiful symphonies in the first half of the film highlight the harmony reflected in the characters and plot. But as the film turns darker, it ditches its light, romantic film score, growing darker and more dramatic.\nBetween its masterful story, narrative, cast, and music, \"Parasite\" is more than just a good movie. It has proven its stand in the film industry, winning the Golden Palm (highest award) in 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It will be no surprise if Joon-ho and his crew bring home some awards in the upcoming Oscars."}, {"text": "There's a time-honored tradition of turning celebrated movies into television series. A lot of them have ended up as sitcoms: \"The Odd Couple,\" \"M*A*S*H,\" \"Alice\" (spun out of Martin Scorsese's 1974 landmark \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\"). But not all of them. Did you know that \"Casablanca\" was turned into two different TV series, one in 1955 and one in 1983? (The latter starred David Soul as Rick Blaine!) In 1976, they tried it with \"Serpico.\" Sometimes, a series can seem a true extension of the movie it's adapted from - that's what happened with \"Fargo\" and \"Dear White People.\" Sometimes, the movie that spawned a series will come to seem a mere footnote to the show - that's what happened with \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and \"Friday Night Lights.\" And in the case of \"Parenthood\" (though it took two tries to get it right), a movie can be turned into an ideal show because it was always TV at heart.\nBut even given the vast history of movies-into-television, the announcement last week that \"Parasite,\" Bong Joon Ho's deliriously ambitious, wildly acclaimed, staggeringly popular South Korean sociological thriller, would now be converted into a limited series for       \u00a0    HBO, with Bong and Adam McKay teaming up as executive producers, has to count as a total eyebrow-raiser. And part of what's eyebrow-raising about it is that the news didn't raise more eyebrows. It barely raised a shrug.\nOne of the headiest, most lavishly praised foreign-language films of its era gets remade, just like that, into a miniseries. (And we don't even know yet how it will do at the Oscars!) \"Parasite,\" as a movie, has only begun to carve out its place in the culture, yet the idea that its story, its substance, its themes, its metaphors, its very form is already an utterly malleable thing is a very 21st-century concept. There's a refreshing lack of pretension to the idea. This isn't about Bong Joon Ho sweating whether his film gets etched onto a monument of canonical reverence. It's about Bong, even at the moment he's being saluted around the world as a newly preeminent maestro, stepping off the pedestal and going with the media flow.\nI say more power to him. But to ask a genuinely unprecedented question: What will the HBO version of a movie like \"      \u00a0    Parasite\" look like? More to the point: What does it portend for the future?\nGiven the rarefied atmosphere of prestige that a film like \"Parasite\" occupies (the Palme d'Or at Cannes; the rave reviews, top spots on 10 Best lists, and bevy of year-end critics'-group awards; the Golden Globes kudo; the slew of Oscar nominations that will surely greet it tomorrow morning; the rising number of people who think that it has a genuine shot to win best picture), it's hard to consider the potential HBO version of \"Parasite\" without cracking a few obligatory dislocating jokes.\nAs in...what's next? A 12-chapter Netflix soap opera entitled \"Roma: Another Year,\" which traces the further adventures of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) and the Mexico City family she works for, though Cleo herself utters only three lines of dialogue per episode? \"Life Is Beautiful...Everywhere,\" in which Robert Benigni stars as a rotating series of international bumpkins, each one imprisoned by the forces of his homeland (Bosnia, Iran, Brazil, China), and by the end of each episode you'll be smiling through your tears of political outrage? Or how about \"Two Days, One Night: Marxist Apprentice,\" in which the Dardenne brothers adapt their celebrated 2014 drama into a highly austere reality series, where contestants have just 36 hours to bring social justice to their workplaces?\nOkay, I'll stop. But the point is: How often has a film as singular and as deadly serious as \"Parasite\" been wedged into the small screen? All but never, if you consider that a sitcom like \"M*A*S*H\" didn't pretend to be the subversive comic hand grenade that Robert Altman's movie was (Altman, aghast at the idea, claimed to have never watched the show). That said, there's a galaxy of difference between a network series and an HBO miniseries, which really can feel like a movie. I assume that \"Parasite,\" though the precise details of the series have yet to be released or maybe even nailed down, will tell the same essential story the movie tells, probably now set in an American city (San Francisco? Boston? Portland?), and will expand and enrich the narrative.\nIf I shared the opinion of many of my critical colleagues that \"Parasite\" is, quite simply, the movie of the year, then I'd probably, on a basic level, object to this project. After all, why mess with perfection? But I'm personally attracted to the prospect of the HBO \"Parasite\" precisely because I thought the film was good rather than great. I had an issue with it, one that many viewers I've spoken to share. The first half, in which the members of the down-and-out Kim family in Seoul infiltrate the much wealthier home of the Park family, pretending to be tutors and servants, all so that they can revel in the luxury of living in that posh enclave, is devious Hitchcockian bliss. It's a suspense tale that's also a highly sensualized parable of vengeful class envy.\nBut as I watch \"Parasite,\" I'm disappointed, on some primal childlike level, when the ingenious deception the Kim family has orchestrated begins to fall apart. It happens too quickly; I want it to go on! As soon as the film moves into that basement bunker, where the Parks' former housekeeper's husband lives, I feel like the movie's dirty joy starts to seep out of it. It becomes what it probably, in a sense, always was - a dark didactic illustration of the competing rage of the haves and the have-nots. In the HBO version, Bong, I suspect, will have greater freedom to revel in the sheer playacting fantasy that gives \"Parasite\" its charge. I could definitely use another hour or two of that.\nThe best description I've read of \"Parasite\" comes from the director Paul Schrader, who in a Facebook post said that the movie starts off as Bu\u00f1uel and ends up as Tarantino (weapons, blood, life gone gonzo). Maybe that's the trend this year. (\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" starts as Tarantino and ends as Herschell Gordon Lewis.) And maybe the HBO \"Parasite\" will just be a more padded, less essential cover version of the same thing. In our binge-watching era, when too many people glibly sanctify the \"superiority\" of series television, I always say: There isn't a single great movie of the last 100 years that needed to be a minute longer. So why make \"Parasite\" several hours longer? Because, just maybe, it's an experiment that can poke at the possibilities of the new synergy of movies and television. And can do something gripping with them. And can demonstrate that what we once thought of as a \"foreign film\" may not be a foreign film at all. The tagline for the new \"Parasite\" could almost be: It's not cinema. It's HBO.\nMore from Variety\nJennifer Lopez, Mary Kay Place, Bong Joon Ho Accept Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards      \u00a0    Olivia Wilde, Bong Joon Ho, Taika Waititi and Denis Villeneuve Accept Hollywood Critics Association Awards      \u00a0    TV News Roundup: Comedy Central Renews 'This Week at the Comedy Cellar' For Season 3"}, {"text": "This is part three of a nine-part entertainment review series by The Easterner.

His opinions expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect the views of The Easterner, its staff or Eastern Washington University.\nWARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS!\n...\nYou sure you want to move forward?\n...\nYou suuuuure?\n...\nAlright. Don't say I didn't warn you. Ahem.\n\"Parasite\" is a darkly comedic, socially satirical film from accomplished writer and director Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Okja, The Host). Released on May 30, 2019 in South Korea, then October 5 of the same year in the USA, \"Parasite\" went on to win a litany of awards, including Academy Award for Best Picture.\nAs a student of film, I find myself constantly unable to turn off \"filmmaker brain\" while watching movies. Analysis of shots, scenery, dialogue and other narrative aspects are always smacking me in the face while I try to enjoy a good story. \"Parasite\" kidnaps filmmaker brain and holds it hostage for its 2 hour and 12 minute runtime.\u00a0\nWe are immediately dropped in on the Kim family; a brother, sister and their parents of less-than-ideal wealth. Ki-woo, the brother, has connections and friendship to collegiate Min-hyuk, an English tutor. Min-hyuk works for the Park family, a well-endowed and affluent family household. The film's inciting incident occurs when Min-hyuk asks Ki-woo to tutor the Park's eldest daughter, Da-hye, while he is abroad. Shortly after, Min-hyuk stops in on the Kim's dinner and presents them a gift: a scholar's rock. A gift of Min-hyuk's grandfathers, the scholar's rock is prophesied to bring good wealth (something the Kim's could definitely benefit from). With the gift of the scholar's rock, Ki-woo forges his way into the Park household.\nAs Ki-woo (referred to as \"Kevin\" in the Park household) begins his teachings, he realizes the oblivity of the matriarch of the Park household. Through this oblivity, Ki-woo is able to deceive the Park family into hiring his entire family as various talented - yet completely unrelated - houseworkers.\u00a0\nKi-woo's sister, Ki-jung is onboarded (codename \"Jessica\", a friend from Chicago) as an art therapist for the Park's hyperactive son, Da-song. Ki-jung, the one who created Ki-woo's forged college documents, is rather sly and cunning. She uses these skills to frame the Park's chauffeur into termination, paving the road for their father Ki-taek to take over as the family's driver.\u00a0\nFinally, the three Kims (disguised, so the Parks won't be able to tell they're related) take advantage of the health of the Park's housekeeper Moon-gwang, falsifying a case of tuberculosis. The oblivious matriarch and her married-for-business husband both agree they cannot have a case of TB around their young son, and terminate Moon-gwang's position immediately. Now, the void left by Moon-gwang can be filled by the final member of the Kim entourage, Chung-sook. The Kim's have now officially infiltrated the Park household, and are climbing their own bootleg ladder in escape from their destitute semi-basement apartment.\nAfter the Kims have stormed the Park castle, they make efforts to disguise their related identities. Because of Da-songs upcoming birthday, the Park's take him camping as a family, leaving the house for upwards of a week. For context, Da-song is in poor health. During one of his previous birthdays, Da-song had an encounter with a ghost from the basement, and now suffers from grand-mal seizures. Thanks to this trauma, the Park's now only celebrate Da-song's birthdays outdoors.\nWith the Park nest left empty, the Kims all live in parasitic luxury in the Park's home. Drinking, celebrating and generally disrespecting, the Kims are eating up their new access to luxury and applaud their excellent charade.\u00a0\nHowever, the peace is shattered when the doorbell rings.\nAt the door is Moon-gwang, the previous housekeeper. She's simply requesting she be let in to retrieve something from the basement. She was rushed out in a flurry, after all.\nChung-sook tentatively allows Moon-gwang entry, while the remaining Kims hide out of sight in the living room. Moon-gwang disappears into the basement. After some time, Chung-sook descends into the ominous food storage basement, to find Moon-gwang struggling to open the door to a secret underground bunker.\u00a0\nThis is where the film completely switches gears. And maybe, you might want to pause on this review and watch the movie, if you don't want the events potentially spoiled. It's on Hulu!\nChung-sook secretly follows Moon-gwang into the depths of the bunker, to find the housekeeper's husband Geun-sae, hiding from loan sharks. Chung-sook is appalled to discover this, threatening to report Moon-gwang to the Parks.\nMoving back, the remaining Kims are curious as to where Chung-sook and Moon-gwang have been for so long. They go down to the basement to discover the open door.\u00a0\nThe remaining Kims also descend into the hidden bunker.\nFlashforward, Chung-sook's interrogation is interrupted by the remaining Kims falling into a crumpled heap behind her. You can cut the tension with a knife in this scene. Moon-gwang nabs Chung-sooks cellphone and records Ki-woo referring to Ki-taek as father. The ruse is shattered on digital video.\nAfter this standoff, the Kims head back upstairs to a ringing phone. Moon-gwang and Geun-sae are at this point, trapped in the bunker.\nOn the other end of the phone are the Parks.\nOn their way home.\nWithin ten minutes.\nThe Kims narrowly escape their employers home, and return to their (now flooded) apartment. The Kims spend the night in a gymnasium, filled with other displaced persons.\nJoon Ho's narrative comes to its peak the next day, at Da-song's outdoor backyard birthday. Ki-woo takes the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae, to no avail. Geun-sae, gone stark-crazy and filled with rage, makes his way upstairs to the outdoor party. It's revealed that the \"ghost\" Da-song saw years ago, was Geun-sae emerging eerily from the basement. This prompts another Da-song seizure.\u00a0\nDuring this seizure, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung in the chest as revenge for threatening his wife, and Geun-sae perishes at the hands of Chung-sook's barbeque stake. Amidst this nightmare, Mr. Park demands Ki-taek's chauffeur character to drive Da-song to the hospital, citing only minutes to act.\nThen, an extra layer is presented.\nAt this moment, Mr. Park's rich and affluent nose causes him to retch at the \"poor\" scent on Ki-taek's clothes, a scent shared amongst all the Kim parasites. Ki-taek notices this intense judgement from Mr. Park.\nThis was the final straw for Ki-taek, as he stabs Mr. Park in the chest.\nThe film wraps up efficiently, weeks later. We return on Ki-woo's recovery from brain surgery after Geun-sae attacked him at the party. Ki-jung is dead. Ki-taek is missing. The Parks have moved on, their home sold to an unaware German family.\n\"Parasite\" is far and away one of the best films I've seen all year. I can't recommend it enough.\nThe film makes many commentaries on class structure. If you're like me, who flew blindly into \"Parasite\", you may have pondered the obscure title: The Kims and the Parks exist symbiotically. The Parks refuse to live without lavish house employees, and the Kims are willing to literally deceive their employers to death for money. The Kims are parasites that, without a nutrient-rich host, will die.\nLike I mentioned earlier, the cinematography of this film is incredible, specifically when Chung-sook is on the phone with the approaching Parks.\u00a0\nThe Parks ask Chung-sook to make Ram-don, which is a combination of two instant Korean noodles. It is also Da-song's favorite. Mrs. Park also mentions, \"If you boil the water now, the timing would be perfect. There's some sirloin in the fridge, add that too.\" Chung-sook's housekeeper facade complies with her boss' request, but on-screen we see animalistic Chung-sook's horror as she realizes the gravity of the scenario.\nAs soon as Chung-sook hangs up the phone, she delivers the line, \"What the hell is Ram-don?\"\nRam-don serves as one of the central metaphors in \"Parasite\". The Parks take top-of-the-line Korean sirloin, an easily $100+ USD equivalent serving of meat, and pair it with a combination of instant noodles no cheaper than Maruchan Ramen. This dish illustrates the classist divide between the Parks and the Kims in such a visceral way that even after three viewings, it still gives me chills.\nThe filmic stylings such as these completely encapsulate the viewer. \"Parasite\" yanks the audience into the action, especially when they would much prefer against it.\n\"Parasite\" received a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as The Academy Awards for: Best Picture, Best International Feature, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. \"Parasite\" also received the Palme d'Or award, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance Cast in a Motion Picture.\u00a0\nDo yourself a favor. Watch \"Parasite\". \"Parasite\" is a film that greatly benefits from close reading and keen observation. Its rapid pace and unexpected twists make for a very re-watchable piece, and I know I've got plenty of time at-home now to mull over its numerous details."}, {"text": "Aug 14, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Beloved South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho[1]'s latest already has plenty to recommend it, from a boundary-busting Palme d'Or win at Cannes[2]to a massive box office showing in the filmmaker's home country[3]and even inclusion on IndieWire's own list of the best films of the decade[4]. Next up: a fall festival run and a prime awards-season stateside release date. So what's all the fuss about? Let the film's first U.S. trailer explain, which unspools a tale of two families unlike anything you've seen before. \nBilled as a 'pitch-black modern fairytale,' the film follows two very different families who find themselves tangled up in a complex (and yes, parasitic) bond that is threatened by encroaching outside forces. While the Kim family has street smarts to spare, they've got little else to recommend them \u2014 but don't tell the rich Park family that, who easily let the Kims inside their bubble thanks to the Kims' various 'luxury services.' First, the Kim kids offer their services as a tutor and an art therapist, then the rest of the Kims appear with their own skills that the Parks desire to make their rich lifestyle even more cushy. As the Kims cleverly cull any possible interlopers and begin to install their own clan as the Parks' go-to employees, the queasy bond seems to be working. And then things change. As IndieWire's own David Ehrlich wrote in his Cannes review of the film[5], 'Giddy one moment, unbearably tense the next, and always so entertaining and fine-tuned that you don't even notice when it's changing gears, 'Parasite[6]' takes all of the beats you expect to find in a Bong film and shrinks them down with clockwork precision. With 'Parasite,' Bong finally becomes a genre unto himself. Ditching the sci-fi elements that have defined his recent work in favor of a more grounded (but no less eccentric) story of life under the pall of late capitalism, Bong's latest offers another compassionate parable about how society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people.' The film stars Bong's regular collaborator and starSong Kang Ho, along with Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, and Chang Hyae Jin. 'Parasite' will next screen at TIFF in its Special Presentations section, and is expected to roll out at other festivals during the fall season. Neon will release the film in theaters on October 11.

However, the deals have not yet been finalized and no further details have been provided about the plot, too. The movie has been receiving universal acclaim since its premiere at last year's Cannes Film Festival. \n'Parasite' won the Palme d'Or and became the first film since 2013's 'Blue Is The Warmest Color' to win the prestigious trophy with a unanimous vote.The movie chronicles the journey of the poor Kim family that enters the lives of the supremely rich Park family. The relationship between the two families takes a sharp twist when Kim's plans of becoming rich get entangled in an unexpected incident.The satirical comedy also became the first Korean movie to get nominations at the Golden Globes. The acclaimed movie was awarded Best Foreign-Language Film byNew York Film Critics Circle[2](NYFCC) and it was given the Special Award by theAmerican Film Institute[3](AFI).Just recently, the film and Joon-Ho turned out to be the biggest winners at the 2020 National Society of Film Critics (NSFC) Awards[4]. The movie was adjudged Best Picture while Joon-Ho won in the Screenplay category.But the biggest moment in Joon-Ho's life came when he was nominated for two trophies at the 2020 Golden Globes \u2014 considered to be one of the most prestigious awards shows after the Oscars. The film, starring Song Kang-Ho, Lee Sun-Kyun, Cho-Yeo Jeong, Choi Woi-Shik, and Park So-Dam in pivotal roles, won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Film at the star-studded ceremony. While receiving the award, the director noted that the time people would try to'overcome' the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, they willbe introduced to so many 'amazing' films.[embedded content]As of late, the movie has won more than 150 international awards and with the Academy Awards and Critics' Choice Awards still to come, the numbers could go up. The movie currently holds a score of 99 percent[5] on the review site Rotten Tomatoes, and it has been nominated for seven Critics' Choice Awards[6], including Best Picture.

His smile[2]. His crazy hair[3]. The way he walks, and, yes, the way he talks[4], but especially the way he directs \u2014 all of these (literally) winning attributes not only contributed to a history-making 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, but kept it from ranking among the worst telecasts of all time. Thanks to #8216;Parasite's#8217; four wins \u2014 especially its dark horse victories for Best Picture and Best Director \u2014 the 2020 Oscars show stands as one of the best ever. With any other champion, the post-ceremony conversation would already be focused on what to fix next year \u2014 and anyone in charge should start making a to-do list now: Hiring a host is a must. Cutting the length down from a bloated three-and-a-half hours is, too. \nFinding a unifying theme, or even a consistent tone, would be the ethereal pursuit for next year's producers, while they sit in dread of more speeches like this year's unmemorable crop. So much of what was put forth during the 2020 Oscars simply didn't work, and it would've added up to an ugly failure on all fronts \u2014 if not for our Lord and Savior, Director Bong. The #8216;Parasite#8217; wins represented everything the Oscars were otherwise lacking, from their element of surprise to the glass ceilings they shattered, but before we all choose to collectively forget the rest of the ceremony, let's take it one more from the top: By all accounts, the 2020 Oscars looked first looked like a traditional ceremony, opening with a song-and-dance number, a comedic monologue, and a speech from a bonafide movie star. To all the folks wondering why the show's producers didn't just name Janelle Mone host, I have no answers for you. She's young, charismatic, incredibly talented, and they clearly trusted her to kick off the evening right. Plus, she did set the tone of the night \u2014 and it isn't her fault that said tone was best described as #8216;emotional whiplash.#8217; It's not that the two opening numbers didn't gel; that part is by design. It's that the audience didn't know what to do with either one, a theme that carried over to the rest of the night (except, of course, for all those #8216;Parasite#8217; wins, which were met with exactly the right responses). Walking out with a sweet, brief tribute of Mr. Rogers, Mone soon pivoted to a rousing rap/spoken-word number featuring dancers dressed as Oscar-nominated movies and not Oscar-nominated movies? While Mone soldiered on, literally forcing the reticent audience into snapping, singing, and dancing \u2014 save for Rita Wilson, who was into it, bless her soul \u2014 actual soldiers boogied down behind her. All that pizzazz distracted more than it energized, and viewers[5] at home wondered[6] why the Oscars would remind everyone of the movies their voters chose not to honor[7]. But that was nothing compared to the confusion sparked by Eminem's surprise performance of #8216;Lose Yourself#8217; halfway through the show. No, he wasn't nominated; no, 2020 isn't a significant anniversary for the Oscar-winning 2002 song; no, you didn't travel back in time 18 years to watch that telecast \u2014 just like the obvious contextual clues in #8216;Little Women,#8217; you could tell Eminem was taking his one shot in the present day because of his beard. The crowd went along with it as best they could (everyone knows the song), but a surprise performance from a white rapper felt like the strangest addition to an already white ceremony that had used its opening number to emphasize people of color. (After his performance, Eminem tweeted a still-opaque explanation[8].) Much of the evening was equally confounding, in that just about every rewarding high was met by a baffling shrug, if not outright ridicule \u2014 much like Steve Martin and Chris Rock's shared monologue! Rock going after Jeff Bezos was great, but undercut by an eye-rolling Iowa caucus joke;Martin repeatedly pointing out that he and Rock are not hosting the show is a much-needed acknowledgement since they did host before, but the duo whiffed while trying to acknowledge the lack of women directors. (#8216;I thought there was something missing from the list this year#8217; #8216;Vaginas?#8217; #8216;Yeah.#8217; OK, guys, but there's also something missing from that joke.) These two are always a welcome presence, and yet the show itself matched their hit-and-miss rapport. including the speeches. Brad Pitt couldn't top himself after a season of incredible thank yous[9] and Quentin Tarantino digs; Laura Dern was sweet in thanking her parents Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, but offered little we hadn't heard in past ceremonies; even Taika Waititi's typically reliable hilarity was undermined by his apparent surprise. (You were one of two favorites! Come prepared!) Hildur Gunad\u00f3ttir became the first female composer to win in 22 years \u2014 adding to an impressive six-month haul[10] that now includes an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Grammy (both for #8216;Chernobyl#8217;) \u2014 and her genuine emotion helped temporarily arrest the audience. But then her #8216;Joker#8217; cohort Joaquin Phoenix took the stage for one of two exhausting final speeches that tried to touch on far too many topics. Rather than making a convincing point about one thing, the expected Best Actor winner chose to talk about everything \u2014 taking a stand against gender and racial discrimination, environmental disconnect, and the evil corporations behind milk! Phoenix should've taken his own advice to the audience and stopped when he was ahead, and he teed up Renee Zellweger for a rough stint, when the #8216;Judy#8217; star couldn't wrap her long ode to Judy Garland into one affecting sentiment. Add those speeches to redundant, elongating choices by producers \u2014 like having presenters for the presenters (because there was no host to introduce the actors announcing the winners) and then asking them to read each nominee's name even though the video montage could've done that in half the time \u2014 and, any other year, this would've been a catastrophic ceremony. But it wasn't. It was one of the best telecasts ever. #8216;Parasite#8217; and Director Bong made sure of it. First, the #8216;Okja#8217; and #8216;Memories of Murder#8217; helmer became an instant gif icon with his giddy, wordless reaction to winning Best Original Screenplay. Then, during his speech for Best International Feature, he asked the audience to appreciate his #8216;Parasite#8217; cast (after they were snubbed for individual honors) before sending everyone scrambling for a ticket to the Neon afterparty by exclaiming, #8216;I'm ready to drink tonight!#8217; He doubled down on the sentiment with his Best Director win, promising to #8216;drink until next morning#8217; after nearly bringing Martin Scorsese to tears with as earnest a thank you as you'll ever see at the Oscars. At this point, a #8216;Parasite#8217; Best Picture win started to feel like a real possibility, and whenever it feels like there's an upset in the offing, the Oscars come alive. Plenty of prognosticators predicted the Neon release[11] would triumph, but the odds-on favorite remained #8216;1917#8217; up until Jane Fonda announced (after a very dramatic pause) the first foreign-language drama to ever win the Academy Awards' top prize. (Her announcement is the inverse of #8216;Moonlight's#8217; victory; then, confusion killed any immediate satisfaction, while Fonda's composure elevated this moment.) This came after #8216;Parasite#8217; became the first South Korean film to ever win Best International Feature, which came after #8216;Parasite#8217; became the category's first South Korean nominee. All these firsts are incredibly significant, and yet Bong has preached the ubiquity of film throughout his unprecedented awards run. He's rightly paid tribute to his home country and the devout audiences who've always supported him, while emphasizing the impact his competitors have had on his work and pushing for audiences to embrace film as a universal, unifying medium. The whipsmart writer-director disregarded the uniquely American aspects of artistic competition at every turn, choosing instead to make an eternal awards run[12] feel like what it always claims to be: a celebration of film. In other words, he's lived the words spoken by so many of the winners \u2014 #8216;commonality,#8217; #8216;inclusivity,#8217; #8216;doing the right thing#8217; \u2014 and the world got to watch the film community respond to that message Sunday night with thunderous applause and gold statues. The Oscars put their money where their mouth is, walking the walk instead of just talking the talk, and each time #8216;Parasite#8217; won, it was a sight to behold. At the Golden Globes, when #8216;Parasite#8217; won the trophy for Best Foreign-Language Film, Director Bong delivered a quote that resonated throughout this awards season. #8216;Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.#8217; Clearly, the Academy heard his message, and now, they've given the rest of America a reason to hurdle their own barriers, as well. For that, we'll forget everything else. #8216;Parasite#8217; won four Academy Awards. Nothing else matters.Grade: AThe 92nd Academy Awards took place Sunday, February 9, 2020 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, CA and aired on ABC[13].

The company is hoping to accomplish this mighty aim, at least in part, with a slate of remakes of South Korean box office hits for major overseas markets, most notably the U.S. Already announced are a pair of collaborations with superstar Kevin Hart: the comedy 'Extreme Job' and the dramedy 'Bye, Bye, Bye.' And while details aren't yet firm, the company is also considering an American remake of Bong Joon-ho[2]'s critically acclaimed Palme d'Or winner 'Parasite[3].' 'We are in very early talks right now,' said Francis Chung, vice president global business and head of U.S. productions at CJ Entertainment, the film's backers. \nDuring a wide-ranging interview with IndieWire about the company's international plans, Chung was expectedly mum on specifics regarding a potential American remake of 'Parasite,' including who they are in talks with, and which potential stars and filmmakers they are currently eyeing for the gig. The film marks Bong's comeback to Korean-language film following his 'Okja' (2017) and 'Snowpiercer' (2013). It is also his fourth collaboration with his frequent star Song Kang-ho ('Snowpiercer,' 'The Host,' 'Memories of Murder'). Ahead of any stateside redo of the film, NEON[4] will release the Cannes-winning 'Parasite' on October 11 in Los Angeles and New York, positioning the title as a prime awards season contender in the international film category and beyond. The lauded film will receive a traditional arthouse platform release. The film made history at this year's Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first Korean movie to take the festival's top honor.'Parasite' also topped IndieWire's Cannes critics poll[5], winning honors for both best film and best screenplay.In his review, senior film critic David Ehrlich called the dark comedy-drama[6] 'giddy, brilliant, and totally unclassifiable' and one of Bong's best directorial efforts to date. 'Parasite' opened in South Korea on May 30, with a massive home country debut of $25 million. IndieWire box office guru Tom Brueggemann noted that[7] the figure represented about 70% of total box office that weekend: 'To put that in perspective based on population size compared to the US/Canada domestic total, that would be similar to a nearly $200 million debut here. The initial number looks to have come close to the record for biggest opener ever.'

Bong Joon-ho's hilarious and horrifying Palme d'Or winner has dazzled audiences in the director's native South Korea and across the world, slaying the global box office as few foreign-language films do. \nSee related Parasite trailer: the Korean genre movie that might just win an Oscar[2] Oscars 2020 predictions and front runners[3] Bong's class-war banger created a perfect storm of box office success and critical acclaim in late 2019 and the tumult shows little sign of abating in 2020. A February UK theatrical release and home entertainment offerings elsewhere will doubtless put the feature in front of many more eager viewers. Kim Ki-taek (key Bong collaborator Song Kang-ho) and his hard-up nuclear family live in a poky Seoul basement flat when his son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) hears of a golden opportunity for a stellar grift. Ki-woo's pal Min-hyuk has been tutoring Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), the daughter of the affluent Park family, but has to give up the gig to study abroad. The two concoct a plan for Ki-woo to take over the tutoring job - despite Ki-woo being woefully under-qualified - and soon he's ensconced in the Park household and plotting ways to set up the rest of his family with sweet jobs. Using the kind of diligence, planning and cunning thatBlackadder's Baldrick could only dream of, Ki-woo's sister Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) is set up as an art teacher for young Park Da-song, Ki-taek usurps the Park's driver and housekeeper Moon-gwang is maneuvered aside for Kim matriarch Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). In the telling of how all four Kims come to sit pretty in the Park residence without being recognised as a family of con-artist imposters, Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won show more wit and invention than many filmmakers manage for the duration of their running time but in Parasite, this is just the wild hors d'oeuvre ahead of the strangely captivating feast. The remainder of Bong's film is packed with surprises but Moon-gwang (excellent portayed by Lee Jung-eun) is not as easily disregarded as it may seem and neither is the ostensibly ordinary, if beautifully designed, structure of the Park household. Parasite is one of those beautiful rarities in cinema, a clever art-house title with much to say that is riotously entertaining and easily accessible. It tackles aspiration and affluence, desperation and poverty in ways in which all viewers can understand and find recognisable truths in. Neither the Parks nor the Kims are broad-brush villians or heroes and for the most part it's easy to sympathise with both families. Whether one has had the impossibly sad, grindingly tough experience of poverty or been lucky enough to live without financial pressure, it's clear the former is something to escape from and the latter is a life to hold on to, if possible. There are parallels with Shoplifters, Hirokazu Koreeda's 2018 Palme d'or winner - that's now two consecutive wins at Cannes for films about con-artist families living in poverty made by top-notch East Asian filmmakers. Bong has tackled class division before, with sci-fi train romp Snowpiercer (2013) offering an intriguing but less subtle take on the friction between rich and poor. He's also gone more directly for the horror jugular with The Host (2006) and less successfully weirder with GM super-pig oddity Okja (2017). Yet Parasite is Bong's best work to date, a fine summation of his ideas and talent. It shares much with Jordan Peele's Us, in that both films loosely exist in the horror space, both look at society's major ills directly and allegorically and both surely are influenced by Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs (1991). Yet the Peele and Us comparisons are most apt on the issue of cinematic quality - for Parasite is another unmissable 2019 film, created by another director working at the top of his game who we can expect more fine work from in future. Parasite is in UK cinemas from 7 February.

Oscar winner Brad Pitt (best supporting actor for Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood), who produced Bong\u2019s last movie Okja, released in 2017.\nFilmmakers and hardcore movie fans have been hip to Bong for years.\n\u201cBong\u2019s other films have already received a good deal of recognition and praise from American critics and filmgoers,\u201d said Jae Won Edward Chung, assistant professor of Asian languages and cultures at Rutgers University and a Bong fan. \u201cSnowpiercer (2013) and Okja have A-list stars like Chris Evans and Jake Gyllenhaal, and The Host (2006) got rave reviews when it was released in the States.\u201d\nThey\u2019re all worth checking out, he said, but for the uninitiated, he also recommends some of the director\u2019s early, lesser known work.\n\"Most people probably haven\u2019t heard of Barking Dogs Never Bite -- a quirky black comedy about a struggling academic trying to settle a score with a neighbor\u2019s dog that won\u2019t stop yapping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably still my favorite film by Bong Joon Ho. It doesn\u2019t take itself as seriously as his later works, and yet it has these wonderfully observed everyday moments that really haunt you for a long time after it\u2019s over.\u201d\nIf you want to see Parasite and some of the director\u2019s previous movies, here\u2019s what to expect and how to find them:\nParasite (2019). Two Korean families, one rich and one poor, intertwine in increasingly fraught ways as members of the lower class family take jobs in the wealthy household. Starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, and Parks-dam. The movie is still in theaters, including the Ritz Five and Bryn Mawr Film Institute. You can also rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and YouTube.\nOkja (2017). A Korean farm girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) lives in the mountains with a giant pig, who is removed and taken to New York, where an agri-business CEO (Tilda Swinton) has has sinister plans for the animal. The corporate agenda is undermined by animal rights activists (Paul Dano, Steven Yeun). Gyllenhaal is the TV celebrity mixed up in the ensuing media frenzy. Streaming on Netflix.\nSnowpiercer (2013). Survivors of a climate-engineering disaster hurtle through a frigid future inside a train, where a revolutionary (Chris Evans) tries to disrupt the rigid class hierarchy that exists on board. With Swinton, Ed Harris, and John Hurt. Streaming on Netflix.\nMother (2009). A extremely twisted tale of a mother (Kim Hye-ja) who will do anything for her son, and a son (Won Bin) who will do anything for mom. As we see in the director\u2019s other films, family can be murder. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Vudu, and YouTube.\nThe Host (2006). Chemicals dumped into a river produce a ravenous creature that preys upon local residents. A street vendor (Song Kang-ho) fights back with the thing abducts his daughter (Ko Ah-sung). A repertory classic that often turns up in midnight screenings and horror festivals. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and YouTube.\nBarking Dogs Never Bite (2000). Residents of an apartment complex turn on each other when one man\u2019s irritation at a noisy dog leads to an unpredictable sequence of retaliation and retribution. You can rent or buy on Amazon Apple, FandangoNow, and Vudu.\n___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."}, {"text": "\"Parasite\" film starts discussion on foreign film importance\nJanuary 29, 2020 12:00am\n|\nBy Miriam Kim\nPhoto by Twitter |\nThe Daily Targum\nBong Joon-ho's \"Parasite\" has been making a name for itself across media, drawing in exceptional reviews for its visuals, storytelling and themes. Many around the globe are calling it one of the best (if not the best) films of 2019 - the numerous awards handed out in ceremonies throughout the world further emphasize the global recognition it has garnered.\nAlthough \"Parasite\" is the Korean filmmaker's most recognized work in an international point of view, it is by no means Bong's first hit. Other notable works, such as the crime drama \"Memories of Murder,\" monster film \"The Host\" and sci-fi adventure \"Okja\" has made him recognized as one of the greatest Korean filmmakers from both the domestic and the international audience.\nIn general, foreign language films rarely achieve significant attention in the U.S. compared to their domestic competition, but now and then there are examples that surpass the language barrier to find its way to the U.S. mainstream audience. \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" and \"Life is Beautiful,\" two of the highest-grossing foreign language films in the U.S. according to IMDb, are examples of this.\nPart of \"Parasite's\" international commercial success can be attributed to Bong's consistency of creating one successful work after another, which has raised higher and higher expectations for his upcoming works.\nYet, unlike the buzz surrounding Bong's latest feature, his older films have been contained to a niche, in addition to the Korean viewership. But this niche seems to have gained more presence as \"Parasite\" keeps increasing its influence abroad. Another important factor that has affected the movie's popularity is the incredibly positive social media response and word-of-mouth recommendations.\nIt is difficult to say for sure that \"Parasite\" will make people more responsive to films from abroad like this in the future, but Bong will certainly gain a bigger following after this international hit.\nThere are numerous aspects of Bong's \"Parasite\" that make it appealing. Bong's movies usually involve a plot which unveils a particular aspect about society that runs rampant, out-of-control and invisible - with a good serving of dark humor, of course.\nPerhaps these social issues aren't constantly noticed in the quiet passing of our lives, but stories often serve the purpose of putting the uncomfortable truths into the spotlight. Bong displays it quite shamelessly on wide-screen with great emotional impact and eye-catching entertainment.\nIn \"Parasite,\" Bong focuses on the socioeconomic issues prevalent in South Korea. Much of the conflict is stirred by the impacts of income gap, represented by two families of the opposite economic status. Something that is also referred to in the movie - and is also prevalent in many circumstances of students - is the relationship between prestige, money and education.\nThe story is based on modern South Korea, so there may be details about the characters and setting that are harder to catch or understand without cultural context. Despite the cultural differences, the struggle for prosperity as well as status in a capitalist system is something that any audience can resonate with. And when the gap between the lower and upper classes becomes more apparent, it can also feel hopeless to outdo that system in order to rise a little higher.\n\"'Okja,' 'Snowpiercer,' 'Parasite,' they're all stories about capitalism. Before it's a massive, sociological term, capitalism is just our lives.\" Bong said, according to an interview by Vulture.\nAfter winning the Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 5, in his speech Bong expressed his wish for people to be able to watch films of any language: \"Once you overcome the one inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\"\nFilms from other countries may be of a different language, but they can also serve as a bridge between countries so people can overcome differences and find more similarities in societies miles away."}, {"text": "Aug 14, 2019( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Bong Joon-Ho's latest film, 'Parasite,' is a vicious satire of class and wealth with a bloody twist. The first trailer for the Korean auteur's movie showcases the best aspects of his sense of humor and his knack for sinister drama and tension. \n'Parasite' is Bong's return to his native language after making the English-language films 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja.' 'Parasite' also won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival before Neon scooped it up, with plans to release the film on Oct. 11. 'Parasite' is the story of a poor, unemployed family in South Korea who defrauds a wealthy, eccentric and gullible family by posing as various experts and servants and swindling their way into cushy jobs. The son of the poor family takes a job as a tutor of the wealthy family's teenage daughter despite having no college degree. He then convinces his sister to pretend she's a world-class art tutor, despite no formal training of any kind.

It is also the first movie to win both Best Picture and best international feature.\nWith the recent \"Oscars So White\" campaign, this is a huge deal in the movie industry. This motion picture has brought attention to foreign films, especially non-English ones. All of this is incredibly deserved because the film was absolutely wonderful. \"Parasite,\" (2019) directed by Bong Joon-Ho, is a Korean language picture that comments on social classes.\nIt does so through two different families: the rich, upper-class Park family and the poor, lower-class Kim family.\nThe film is full of surprises, and despite what many might assume, it is not a horror movie. It is a dramatic thriller with only one moment that really stands out as spooky.\nHowever, there is a lot of violence and blood, so viewer discretion is advised.\nBong Joon-Ho's use of color and space in this film is reminiscent of other East Asian films. While the scenes are very colorful, they are not colors that would usually be very pleasing to the eye. However, the shots are stunning.\nOne might compare the set-up of various shots to those of Alfred Hitchcock, who used space in unique ways. While the color is obviously different from Hitchcock's black and white films, the repetition of stairways and views from windows might make one compare this movie to those of Hitchcock.\nThe script for this film is also quite interesting. There is never a dull moment, and the dialogue certainly added to this. The Kim family is full of people desperate for money, and they have a dry sense of humor about them. This often helps to ease the tension of the plot, which isn't always an easy task.\nThe tension is done very well, leaving the audience on the edge of their seat for half, if not most, of the film. Some scenes in particular are incredibly tense and will leave the viewer questioning who exactly they are rooting for. There are moments when one character's life is on the line, but not because of who the audience might have originally thought.\nNot only is this film about social class, but it is also about morals. It makes an interesting commentary on both subjects, leaving the viewer thinking about this movie for days after seeing it. While the audience starts out rooting for one character, that opinion may switch halfway through.\nThis is something Bong Joon-Ho did incredibly well; he made the characters relatably human. All of them are sympethetically flawed people with questionable morals. \"Parasite\" (2019) is a stunningly crafted film worthy of every Oscar it won. It will leave the audience questioning their way of thinking for days to come, and hopefully, open a few minds at the same time.\nWith President Trump saying he didn't understand this movie, it makes me quite pleased to say just how much I love it. Final score: 10/10.\nLeo Costello\nAUTHOR\nPROFILE"}, {"text": "In Bong Joon Ho\u2019s new film, a destitute family occupies a wealthy household in an elaborate scheme that goes comically \u2014 then horribly \u2014 wrong. \nMidway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling \u201cParasite,\u201d a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none. \u201cThey\u2019re rich but still nice,\u201d he says, aglow with good will. His wife has her doubts. \u201cThey\u2019re nice because they\u2019re rich,\u201d she counters. With their two adult children, they have insinuated themselves into the lives of their pampered counterparts. It\u2019s all going so very well until their worlds spectacularly collide, erupting with annihilating force. Comedy turns to tragedy and smiles twist into grimaces as the real world splatters across the manicured lawn.\nThe story takes place in South Korea but could easily unfold in Los Angeles or London. The director Bong Joon Ho (\u201cOkja\u201d) creates specific spaces and faces \u2014 outer seamlessly meets inner here \u2014 that are in service to universal ideas about human dignity, class, life itself. With its open plan and geometric shapes, the modernist home that becomes the movie\u2019s stage (and its house of horrors) looks as familiar as the cover of a shelter magazine. It\u2019s the kind of clean, bright space that once expressed faith and optimism about the world but now whispers big-ticket taste and privilege.\n\u201cSpace and light and order,\u201d Le Corbusier said, are as necessary as \u201cbread or a place to sleep.\u201d That\u2019s a good way of telegraphing the larger catastrophe represented by the cramped, gloomy and altogether disordered basement apartment where Kim Ki-taek (the great Song Kang Ho) benignly reigns. A sedentary lump (he looks as if he\u2019s taken root), Ki-taek doesn\u2019t have a lot obviously going for him. But he has a home and the affection of his wife and children, and together they squeeze out a meager living assembling pizza boxes for a delivery company. They\u2019re lousy at it, but that scarcely matters as much as the petty humiliations that come with even the humblest job.\nThe Kims\u2019 fortunes change after the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik), lands a lucrative job as an English-language tutor for the teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso), of the wealthy Park family. The moment that he walks up the quiet, eerily depopulated street looking for the Park house it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re not idling in the lower depths anymore. Ki-woo crosses the threshold into another world, one of cultivated sensitivities and warmly polished surfaces that are at once signifiers of bourgeois success and blunt reproaches to his own family\u2019s deprivation. For him, the house looks like a dream, one that his younger sister and parents soon join by taking other jobs in the Park home.\nTake being the operative word. The other Kims don\u2019t secure their positions as art tutor, housekeeper and chauffeur, they seize them, using lies and charm to get rid of the Parks\u2019 other employees \u2014 including a longtime housekeeper (a terrifically vivid Lee Jung Eun) \u2014 in a guerrilla incursion executed with fawning smiles. The Parks make it easy (no background checks). Yet they\u2019re not gullible, as Ki-taek believes, but are instead defined by cultivated helplessness, the near-infantilization that money affords. In outsourcing their lives, all the cooking and cleaning and caring for their children, the Parks are as parasitical as their humorously opportunistic interlopers.\nBong\u2019s command of the medium is thrilling. He likes to move the camera, sometimes just to nudge your attention from where you think it should be, but always in concert with his restlessly inventive staging. When, in an early scene, the Kims crowd their superior from the pizza company, their bodies nearly spilling out of the frame, the image both underscores the family\u2019s closeness and foreshadows their collective assault on the Parks. Nothing if not a rigorous dialectician, Bong refuses to sentimentalize the Kims\u2019 togetherness or their poverty. But he does pointedly set it against the relative isolation of the Parks, who don\u2019t often share the same shot much less the same room.\n[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]\nBong has some ideas in \u201cParasite,\u201d but the movie\u2019s greatness isn\u2019t a matter of his apparent ethics or ethos \u2014 he\u2019s on the side of decency \u2014 but of how he delivers truths, often perversely and without an iota of self-serving cant. (He likes to get under your skin, not wag his finger.) He accents the rude comedy of the Kims\u2019 struggle with slyness and precision timing, encouraging your laughter. When the son and daughter can\u2019t locate a Wi-Fi signal \u2014 the family has been tapping a neighbor\u2019s \u2014 they find one near the toilet (an apt tribute to the internet). And when a cloud of fumigation billows in from outside, an excited Ki-taek insists on keeping the windows open to take advantage of the free insecticide. They choke, you laugh. You also squirm.\nThe lightly comic tone continues after the Kims begin working for the Parks, despite ripples of unease that develop into riptides. Some of this disquiet is expressed in the dialogue, including through the Kims\u2019 performative subservience, with its studied courtesies and strategic hedging. (Bong shares script credit with Han Jin Won.) The poor family quickly learns what the rich family wants to hear. For their part, Mr. and Mrs. Park (Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong) speak the language of brutal respectability each time they ask for something (a meal, say) or deploy a metaphor, as when he gripes about people who \u201ccross the line\u201d and smell like \u201cold radishes.\u201d\nThe turning point comes midway through when the Parks leave on a camping trip, packing up their Range Rover, outdoor projector included. In their absence, the Kims bring out the booze, kick back and take over the house, a break that\u2019s cut short when the old housekeeper returns, bringing a surprise with her. The slapstick becomes more violent, the stakes more naked, the laughs more terrifying and cruel. By that point, you are as comfortably settled in as the Kims; the house is so very pleasant, after all. But the cost of that comfort and those pretty rooms \u2014 and the eager acquiescence to the unfairness and meanness they signify \u2014 comes at a terrible price.\nParasite\nRated R for class exploitation and bloody violence.

It earned both the best picture and best international feature film awards, an unprecedented event, and Bong won the prizes for best director and best original screenplay.\nSam Mendes' 1917 earned three awards (including veteran Roger Deakins for best cinematography), while Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood, James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari and Todd Phillips' Joker each won two. Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) and Renee Zellweger (Rupert Goold's Judy) collected the best actor and best actress awards, with Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood) and Laura Dern (Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story) winning in the best supporting actor and actress categories.\nParasite deserved to win the most serious awards. It was markedly superior to every other film up for consideration. Bong's effort is a complex, troubling work about the social, economic and psychological disaster represented by the vast gap between rich and poor. Two families, the Kims and the Parks, who ordinarily live at the opposite ends of society, are suddenly brought into close proximity, with terrible consequences. The climactic scene culminates in an eruption of class anger.\nAs we noted in our original review, South Korea is one of the most socially unequal societies on the planet. Bong's film spells out, in a thoughtful and logical manner, the inevitable results of such a division: the impoverished will do almost anything to emerge from their nightmarish conditions, subsisting literally in the underworld. The pampered rich, living in a cocoon, are utterly unprepared for the envy, anger and violence their dominance and arrogance provokes.\nBong told the Guardian recently that 'Korea, on the surface, seems like a very rich and glamorous country now, with K-pop, high-speed internet and IT technology \u2026 but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair.'\nThe director, in the film's production notes, pointed to the fact that 'in this sad world humane relationships \u2026 cannot hold.' Parasite, he explains, depicts 'ordinary people' who descend into an 'unavoidable' collision. The film is 'a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.'\nBong told an interviewer last year, 'I think all creators, all artists, and even just everyone, we are always interested in class, 24/7, I think it would actually be strange if we're not. \u2026 I think we all have very sensitive antennae to class, in general.' Unfortunately, as the vast majority of films nominated for Academy Awards this year indicates, this is not the case. The attention certainly of most American filmmakers is firmly on themselves and their ethnic, gender and sexual identities.\nIt is not clear that Bong, who describes his background and present circumstances as thoroughly middle class, is particularly left-wing in his thinking. He may merely be more observant and honest than most in the film world. (His lack of clarity found expression Sunday night in his friendly comments-to the extent they were not merely polite or diplomatic-directed toward fellow best director nominees Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, by whom he claimed to have been inspired. In fact, Parasite is opposed in every significant way to the murky, misanthropic efforts of Scorsese and Tarantino.) Bong has been paying attention in his films to developments in South Korean society for two decades, with such works as Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), Memories of Murder (2003), Mother (2009), Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017).\nThe sweeping triumph of a South Korean film about class resentment and conflict at the Academy Awards has a certain objective significance, no matter what the rest of the Awards program may have been like and no matter how the voters may slip back and delude themselves, as they are wont to do, in subsequent years. Despite all the efforts by the media, the Academy hierarchy and the political establishment generally to drown culture in race and gender, the social questions emerge.\nAnd those efforts Sunday night were considerable. The organizers of the Awards ceremony were stung and disappointed by the outcome of the nominating process, which resulted in only one black performer nominated for an acting award (Cynthia Erivo in Harriet) and no female directors. The last weeks have been dominated by the subsequent media 'furor.'\nThe New York Times, inevitably, played a leading role. The Times, for example, referred in one recent article to 'the Oscars' most noted offscreen controversy-the glaring whiteness and maleness of many of the major categories and movies.' And another piece observed: 'Going into the 92nd Academy Awards, the headlines were about what we wouldn't see: no J. Lo [Jennifer Lopez for Hustlers], no female filmmakers of top films, almost no people of color in the acting categories.' And the relentless Times commented further: 'Old Hollywood-and the way it is represented by the academy and its nominations-has been under the microscope for awhile now, whether because of #OscarsSoWhite or #MeToo or the lack of recognition of female directors.'\nIn our view, American filmmaking is truly deficient at this point in an objectively rooted social and moral compass, oriented to the problem of social inequality and class, as well as the great threats confronting the population, authoritarian rule and war. The filmmaker who is oblivious to these questions, whatever his or her gender, race or orientation, will have little of value to say to an audience.\nAfter all, the first female director on whom the Academy bestowed-with great fanfare and much self-congratulation-its best director prize, in 2012, was Kathryn Bigelow, for the thoroughly falsified, CIA-sponsored account of the death of Osama bin-Laden, Zero Dark Thirty.\nThis year, in response to the angry response to the nominations and the resulting pressures, the organizers of the Awards event did everything within their power to inject race and gender politics into their program Sunday night, to an obvious extent. Desperately over-compensating for their failure to nominate the 'proper' number of 'nonwhite' and 'nonmale' personalities, the Academy made certain that there would be no such complaints when it came to the presenters, singers, comics and musicians, and their various comments about female or black 'representation.'\nThis sort of campaign does not address the legitimate, democratic question of the cultural education and involvement of vast numbers of young people, of all colors and genders, who are excluded from participating in the film, television and music industry because of their social background and economic conditions. What's involved in the Academy's 'diversity' program is the conformist acceptance of the cultural status quo and the mere redistribution of a portion of the existing positions and wealth to African American, female and gay individuals, already affluent in many cases.\nThis appeals only to a relatively thin layer of the population. No doubt various factors account for the continuing decline of the Academy Awards' television audience, which reached its lowest level in history Sunday night, 23.6 million people, but the self-involved, often self-pitying emphasis on race and gender is not widely and popularly appealing.\nFor example, this moment, described by ABC News, was simply grating: '[Actresses] Sigourney Weaver, Gal Gadot and Brie Larson joined together on stage to introduce a groundbreaking performance of this year's nominated best original scores.\n''We want to celebrate the first time in the 92-[year] history of the Academy Awards-a female conductor will be leading the orchestra for this performance,' Weaver said.\n'With Gadot and Larson by her side, Weaver said, 'all women are superheroes.''\nThe New York Times took the unusual step of running an advertisement for their racialist and discredited 'The 1619 Project' during the Awards ceremony. The spot featured actress-singer Janelle Mon\u00e1e (who actually opened the program with a musical number), as one publication described it, 'standing alone on the Virginia shore. The water swirls behind her and the camera pulls in closer as she recites the following words: 'In August 1619, a ship appeared on this horizon near Point Comfort, Virginia. It carried more than 20 enslaved Africans who were sold to the colonists. No aspect of the country we know today has been untouched by the slavery that followed. America was not America, but this was the moment it began.''\nCynically, the Times ad concluded with this title: 'The truth can change how we see the world. The truth is worth it.\"\nDemocratic Party politics dominate the Hollywood film world. In a reference to the recently concluded impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Brad Pitt, accepting his award for best supporting actor (for Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood), quipped, 'They told me I only had 45 seconds, and that's 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.' Bolton, of course, is the extreme reactionary and warmonger with whom the Democrats formed a de facto alliance after his claims about Trump and Ukraine in an upcoming book were leaked to the media.\nThe success of Parasite at the Academy Awards was generally praised by the American media. But not everyone was happy. Of course, an avowedly right-wing columnist last week headlined his comment, 'Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' Is Overrated, Implausible, Class-Struggle Nonsense.'\nAside from such reactionaries, however, a few other nervous voices were raised. Critic Ann Hornaday in the Washington Post , in particular, has made it known that the prominence of Parasite was not pleasing to her. Hornaday's tack was to treat Parasite as though it were simply a variation on the Tarantino-style cinema of gratuitous violence and avoid its social content. 'The techniques and tropes Bong repurposes so adroitly in Parasite ,' she wrote, resorting to feminist jargon, 'make the film feel both original and oddly familiar, the product of the male gaze that still holds sway in Hollywood.'\nSpeaking of the Awards ceremony, Hornaday asserted that 'clips from the best picture nominees played out like so many boys-with-their-toys wish-fulfillment fantasies, complete with swagger, cars that go vroom and women who are either silenced or virtually absent.' How could Greta Gerwig's Little Women compete 'against so many films that mythologized Big Men?' Lumping in Parasite with the confused and even disoriented Joker, the Post critic described the two films as 'derivative and insular, a self-referential grab bag of 'cool' visual style-often involving bloody violence-in service to narratives that were either flimsy or just plain shallow.'\nThe Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, who was in the Academy Awards audience in Los Angeles the other night.

His wife has her doubts. \"They're nice because they're rich,\" she counters. With their two adult children, they have insinuated themselves into the lives of their pampered counterparts. It's all going so very well until their worlds spectacularly collide, erupting with annihilating force. Comedy turns to tragedy and smiles twist into grimaces as the real world splatters across the manicured lawn.\nThe story takes place in South Korea but could easily unfold in Los Angeles or London. The director Bong Joon Ho (\"Okja\") creates specific spaces and faces - outer seamlessly meets inner here - that are in service to universal ideas about human dignity, class, life itself. With its open plan and geometric shapes, the modernist home that becomes the movie's stage (and its house of horrors) looks as familiar as the cover of a shelter magazine. It's the kind of clean, bright space that once expressed faith and optimism about the world but now whispers big-ticket taste and privilege.\n\"Space and light and order,\" Le Corbusier said, are as necessary as \"bread or a place to sleep.\" That's a good way of telegraphing the larger catastrophe represented by the cramped, gloomy and altogether disordered basement apartment where Kim Ki-taek (the great Song Kang Ho) benignly reigns. A sedentary lump (he looks as if he's taken root), Ki-taek doesn't have a lot obviously going for him. But he has a home and the affection of his wife and children, and together they squeeze out a meager living assembling pizza boxes for a delivery company. They're lousy at it, but that scarcely matters as much as the petty humiliations that come with even the humblest job.\nThe Kims' fortunes change after the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik), lands a lucrative job as an English-language tutor for the teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso), of the wealthy Park family. The moment that he walks up the quiet, eerily depopulated street looking for the Park house it's obvious we're not idling in the lower depths anymore. Ki-woo crosses the threshold into another world, one of cultivated sensitivities and warmly polished surfaces that are at once signifiers of bourgeois success and blunt reproaches to his own family's deprivation. For him, the house looks like a dream, one that his younger sister and parents soon join by taking other jobs in the Park home.\nTake being the operative word. The other Kims don't secure their positions as art tutor, housekeeper and chauffeur, they seize them, using lies and charm to get rid of the Parks' other employees - including a longtime housekeeper (a terrifically vivid Lee Jung Eun) - in a guerrilla incursion executed with fawning smiles. The Parks make it easy (no background checks). Yet they're not gullible, as Ki-taek believes, but are instead defined by cultivated helplessness, the near-infantilization that money affords. In outsourcing their lives, all the cooking and cleaning and caring for their children, the Parks are as parasitical as their humorously opportunistic interlopers.\nBong's command of the medium is thrilling. He likes to move the camera, sometimes just to nudge your attention from where you think it should be, but always in concert with his restlessly inventive staging. When, in an early scene, the Kims crowd their superior from the pizza company, their bodies nearly spilling out of the frame, the image both underscores the family's closeness and foreshadows their collective assault on the Parks. Nothing if not a rigorous dialectician, Bong refuses to sentimentalize the Kims' togetherness or their poverty. But he does pointedly set it against the relative isolation of the Parks, who don't often share the same shot much less the same room.\n[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]\nBong has some ideas in \"Parasite,\" but the movie's greatness isn't a matter of his apparent ethics or ethos - he's on the side of decency - but of how he delivers truths, often perversely and without an iota of self-serving cant. (He likes to get under your skin, not wag his finger.) He accents the rude comedy of the Kims' struggle with slyness and precision timing, encouraging your laughter. When the son and daughter can't locate a Wi-Fi signal - the family has been tapping a neighbor's - they find one near the toilet (an apt tribute to the internet). And when a cloud of fumigation billows in from outside, an excited Ki-taek insists on keeping the windows open to take advantage of the free insecticide. They choke, you laugh. You also squirm.\nThe lightly comic tone continues after the Kims begin working for the Parks, despite ripples of unease that develop into riptides. Some of this disquiet is expressed in the dialogue, including through the Kims' performative subservience, with its studied courtesies and strategic hedging. (Bong shares script credit with Han Jin Won.) The poor family quickly learns what the rich family wants to hear. For their part, Mr. and Mrs. Park (Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong) speak the language of brutal respectability each time they ask for something (a meal, say) or deploy a metaphor, as when he gripes about people who \"cross the line\" and smell like \"old radishes.\"\nThe turning point comes midway through when the Parks leave on a camping trip, packing up their Range Rover, outdoor projector included. In their absence, the Kims bring out the booze, kick back and take over the house, a break that's cut short when the old housekeeper returns, bringing a surprise with her. The slapstick becomes more violent, the stakes more naked, the laughs more terrifying and cruel. By that point, you are as comfortably settled in as the Kims; the house is so very pleasant, after all. But the cost of that comfort and those pretty rooms - and the eager acquiescence to the unfairness and meanness they signify - comes at a terrible price.\nParasite\nRated R for class exploitation and bloody violence.

The Palme d'Or winner at the most recent Cannes film festival has garnered much attention since its U.S. release last month-and for good reason.\n\"Parasite\" follows the Kims, a family of four who live in a cramped, underground apartment fit for maybe two. With neither child attending university and both parents unemployed, the entire family is beginning to lose hope, to say the least. That is until a childhood friend of oldest child Ki-woo's shows up bearing gifts, both physically in the form of a large rock (which essentially could've had \"SYMBOL\" painted across it) and through an offer: to take over for him as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks.\nThough their make-up is the same (Mother, Father, Son, Daughter), the Parks exist in direct juxtaposition of the Kims. The patriarch is the CEO of a large IT company, while Yeon-gyo, his wife, is a textbook rich stay-at-home mom. When Yeon-gyo takes liking to Ki-woo-who lied about his education in order to get the job-he quickly hatches a plan to get his entire family involved.\nIt's wildly entertaining to watch as the Kims, much like the titular parasites, plant themselves in the Park estate-daughter Ki-jeong as an art therapist, father Ki-taek as a driver and mother Chung-sook as the housekeeper. A good chunk of the film's comedic aspects come from these scenes, like when Ki-taek strategically uses a packet of hot sauce to convince Yeon-gyo that their previous housekeeper has come down with tuberculosis.\nThe Kims only reap the benefits of their work for a brief period of time, however, as the film undergoes a massive shift in tone around its midpoint. While it plays like a comedy for its first half, a doorbell-ring after a particularly lighthearted scene catapults the film into the madness of its second act, the contents of which I will not be disclosing here because-and this is clich\u00e9-you just have to see it.\nUnder the direction of Bong, whose previous works include \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja,\" \"Parasite\" is a giant, larger-than-life story told with the delicacy of an indie movie and the tension of a big-studio horror. From the start, Bong and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo thrust you into the Kims' world, filming their apartment in such a way that you find yourself feeling suffocated while seated in a multiplex.\nIt's also a testament to Bong's masterful direction that the film is able to feel like so many different things at once. \"Parasite\" is genre-bending at its finest, weaving between comedy, drama and horror with such ease that your emotions struggle to even keep up.\nThe screenplay, penned by Bong and Han Jin-won, is razor sharp, fluctuating between smart takes on class relations to the iconic \"Jessica, only child, from Illinois, Chicago\" rhyme which, and I've checked with the Academy, is in fact a front runner for the Best Original Song Oscar.\nThe twists that act as transitions come sporadically and are genuinely shocking. Just when Bong gets you comfortable with the film in one way, things switch gears. It's uncomfortable, but in the best way.\n\"Parasite\" owes a lot to its ensemble, a solid cast of actors who perfectly capture the intricacies of each character, from the neurotic nature of Ki-woo to the stoic composure of Park Dong-ik, the father of the Park family. Standouts are easily Park So-dam, who nails the more nuanced role of Ki-jeong, and Cho Yeo-jeong in a hilarious turn as Choi Yeon-gyo. If the world is right, either of these women should land a Supporting Actress nomination a la Marina de Tavira for \"Roma,\" last year's breakthrough foreign language feature.\nAnother aspect of \"Parasite\" that ties the film together is the set design. The Park house is stunning, a modern mansion that feels never-ending, with its giant windows and lengthy staircases. The village where the Kims reside is less inviting, but still a technically outstanding set that manages to truly look like an actual South Korean street.\nAside from its visuals, \"Parasite\" is also a wildly important film that acts as fresh, witty and horrifying commentary on South Korean class relations. Bong does this through obvious actions and words, like the relationship the Parks have with their help, but also through a plethora of powerful symbols, most of which cannot be described without spoiling. The most striking case of this is a particularly moving scene as the Kim family quite literally descends to their residence from the Parks', running through the rain in search of the comfort of their home, only to arrive home to it completely destroyed by a flood.\nAll things considered, \"Parasite\" is easily one of the best, if not the best film of the year. Bong handles every aspect with expertise, and its ability to be so much at once while remaining so focused makes it a thrill to watch."}, {"text": "Parasite is a veritable hit.

However Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore, as he presented the jury prize, hit out at Donald Trump, quoting painter Pablo Picasso. \"Art is the lie that enables us to realise the truth,\" he said, \"Trump is the lie that enables us more lying.\" Moore added: \"In dark times, art is what has helped save humanity from the autocrats and idiots.\"\nThe Grand Prix \u2013 considered the runners-up award \u2013 went to Senegalese director Mati Diop for Atlantique, a supernatural drama about African migrants. Diop had atttracted considerable attention before the festival as the first black woman to have a film selected for competition, and her film was a resounding critical success.\nAntonio Banderas was a popular winner of the best actor award for Pedro Almodovar's Pain and Glory; Banderas played a film-maker clearly modelled on Almodovar himself as he looks back over his career, in which memories of his mother (played by Penelope Cruz) loom large.\nEmily Beecham \u2013 the British star of cult hit Daphne \u2013 won the best actress award for Little Joe, a sci-fi parable directed by Austrian film-maker Jessica Hausner.

I think that Cannes has given Korean cinema a great gift.\" He also added that he was pleased to hear that the jury had unanimously voted for Parasite to win, and \"as I am a real fan of films it is another reason to be pleased\".\nBong deflected a suggestion that Parasite contained comments aimed at North Korea, saying that an impression of a North Korean TV anchor in the film was \"just a small joke\". \"If North Koreans see my film one day, I think they will laugh.\"\nIn a press conference after the awards ceremony, Banderas joked that the win was \"good news for his cardiologist\" and thanked Alm\u00f3dovar, the director of Pain and Glory and with whom he has worked in seven previous films. \"The award is for the character I played, and that is the alter-ego of Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar. There is something of him here.\" Banderas added: \"I thank him for the years, our movies together.\"\nBeecham appeared somewhat nonplussed at her win, for Jessica Hausner's sci-fi parable Little Joe, saying she had been \"overwhelmed\" by the experience. \"I had a kind of inkling this morning because I had a phone call from [Little Joe's] producer.

Since then, it has received commercial and critical acclaim internationally.\nAt the 2019 Academy Awards, \"Parasite\" won awards for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film as well as winning Best Picture, the first non-English-language film to have won the award.\n\"Parasite\" is about the Kim family, who live in extreme poverty, attempting to escape their current status in life. The movie is set off by a family friend of the Kims offering their son a job as an English tutor to a wealthy family, the Parks. The son of the Kim family gets the job, and then attempts to get his family jobs working for the Park family by replacing the current staff.\nThe other members of the Kim family pose as unrelated, highly skilled service workers, each being recommended by the previous family member hired. The Kim family replaces the staff by deceiving the Park family into thinking their previous staff are irresponsible or sickly. The tension in the film continues to rise until the very last second and leaves the audience shaken well after the story ends.\n\"Parasite\" dips into so many different genres that it is hard to classify. There are elements of comedy, suspense, drama, horror and even several sequences that feel like they are straight out of a heist movie. Each element plays off each other; the comedic moments make the sections of tragedy and tension hit even harder.\nThere are obvious themes of economic disparity and class conflict at play throughout \"Parasite.\" This is not Joon-Ho's first film that explores these themes, as his previous works \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja\" were also focused on similar ideas as those present in \"Parasite.\"\nJoon-Ho illustrates the disparity of wealth between the Parks and the Kims through masterful and subtle cinematography. Verticality plays a huge role in telling the story of \"Parasite.\" The Kims' home is a half-basement apartment in the slums of the city, while the Parks live at a physically higher point in the city, literally above the rest of the residents.\nAnother scene that shows the financial gap between the two families comes during a downpour. The Parks' son is camping in a tent in their backyard during the storm, and the tent keeps him safe throughout the night. The Kims return to their apartment during the downpour to find that their home has been destroyed by flooding. Even the toys of the rich family surpass the best that the poor family can afford.\nThe morality of the characters within \"Parasite\" fall in something of a grey area. The Parks are not evil people; they do not ostentatiously flaunt their wealth in the eyes of the those who have less than them or treat them cruelly. The father of the Parks does, however, repeatedly mention in a \"line\" that those who work for him cannot cross. This shows his belief that the different classes cannot, or at least should not, exist in the same world.\nFor the part of the Kim family, they show solidarity to each other, but not to those in the same class as themselves. They are responsible for the Park family firing two workers, likely of the same economic situation as the Kims. During the flooding scene, a neighbor asks for help with his home from the Kims, but they ignore him.\nEven the title has a double meaning. The initial reaction is to see the Kims as the parasite, leeching off the wealth of the Parks. However, it could also be read as the Parks parasitically using the labor of the lower classes to serve them.\nThe editing and pacing of \"Parasite\" are so well done that there is never a dull moment. No shot lingers for too long, or cuts too quickly. Scene transitions are done with purpose and oftentimes use the setting to transition creatively. A certain montage scene of the Kims framing the previous housekeeper sticks out as one of the best movie moments of 2019.\nSubtle details and unique shot compositions make repeat viewings of this movie a great experience. It's possible to watch this movie a dozen times and catch a new detail of the story or meaning behind a scene with each viewing. This is how meticulous Joon-Ho was in the creation of his film.\nThis is absolutely a must-watch film. If you enjoy it and would like to see more from Joon-Ho, his previous films \"Okja\" and \"Snowpiercer\" are in English, deal with similar themes and are also excellent."}, {"text": "Feb 10, 2020( Den of Geek: http://www.denofgeek.com Delivered by Newstex)  David Crow[1] Feb 10, 2020 The world's turned upside down as Parasite becomes the first foreign language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture  There can be no other word other than respect crossing the minds of millions after Bong Joon-ho and the cast and crew of Parasite[2], made Oscar history on Sunday night by accepting the Best Picture award. It is the first time a foreign language film has ever achieved this honour. See related Doctor Who: what lies ahead?\n[3] Doctor Who series 12: Alex Kingston talks potential River Song return[4] Netflix UK: what's new in February 2020?[5] Going into the night, there was a strong and vocal support for Parasite that extended from critics and fans alike, but precedence and history ran against the picture. Even after picking up the coveted Best Original Screenplay from the Writers Guild, the fact remains that no foreign language film has ever won Best Picture in its 92 years #8212; only five have even been nominated for the prize since 2000. Nonetheless, Parasite persevered and dominated in many of the categories it was nominated for throughout the night, winning all but two of the six categories it competed in. Among its other wins are Best Original Screenplay, Best International Film (renamed from #8216;Best Foreign Language Film#8217;) and Best Director. Indeed, Bong appeared genuinely astonished when he picked up the Best Director prize over the odds-on favorite, Sam Mendes, director of 1917. #8216;After winning Best International Feature, I thought I was done for the day and ready to relax,#8217; Bong had translated before the Academy. And yet, even then he was not done. He even had to deny the entire Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when the Kodak Theatre stood on their feet and chanted #8216;Bong#8217;, requesting he take the mic. Instead, he left it to his impressive and impressed producers to accept the award. Parasite winning Best Picture is genuinely history being made. With no foreign language film having ever achieved the coup #8212; nor any film since Slumdog Millionaire in 2009 winning without acting nominations #8212; the odds were against the film about class, income inequality, and the agonies of capitalism breaking down what should ostensibly be a symbiotic relationship. It is also a reminder that the Academy is changing. Despite hand-wringing and perpetual wall-to-wall complaining on Twitter and social media, the Academy has transformed a tremendous amount in the 21st century[6], particularly in recent years. Parasite's triumvirate of wins in Picture, Director and Original Screenplay is indicative of this. But so is Joaquin Phoenix[7] taking home the Best Actor Oscar[8] for Joker[9]. While Heath Ledger won a posthumous Best Supporting Actor for the same role 11 years ago, the film he won it for, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight[10], was notably snubbed from even competing in Best Picture or Best Director. Conversely, Joker was the most nominated film of the night, and then picked up groundbreaking Oscars for the superhero movie genre: Best Actor and Best Original Score.

A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. One of them \u2014 we never learn their last name \u2014 lives in a squalid basement apartment, dank and cluttered; all four members, including the grown son and daughter, are out of work, causing them to take desperation jobs like folding pizza boxes. \nThe other family, the Parks, are wealthy, living in a vast, elegant home with green lawns and gleaming floors and a basement stocked with every imaginable need. These two families seem to be living in different worlds, and indeed they are: Our first glimpse of that basement apartment is the sight of socks and underwear hanging to dry by the grimy window; in the immaculate Park house, nothing dirty is ever seen. (A housekeeper is ever-present, but we never even see her cleaning.) But those two worlds connect, in the movie's early scenes: Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the oldest son of the unemployed family, forges some university documents to get a job tutoring the Parks' teenage daughter. Dazzled by the easy money, he encourages his sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) to likewise fake her credentials and get hired as an art therapist for the Parks' young son. [embedded content]  And then well, you'll just have to get pulled in, as I was, watching as a deception gets spun tighter and tighter until you're certain that something will snap, like a rubber band stretched beyond endurance. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong), and the way that Ki-woo's father (Song Kang-ho), a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. 'Parasite' \u2014 the title metaphor becomes abundantly clear \u2014 is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. His mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) corrects her son when he says Mrs. Park is 'rich, but nice' \u2014 she's nice, Chung-sook says, because she's rich. 'Money is an iron,' says this wise mother. 'It smooths out all the creases.' ____ 'Parasite,' with Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Chang Hyae-jin. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, from a screenplay by Bong and Han Jin-won. 131 minutes. Rated R for language, some violence and sexual content.In Korean, with English subtitles. Opens Oct. 25 at SIFF Cinema Egyptian.

The South Korean black comedy-thriller-drama from director/co-writer Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, Okja) isn't exactly what most would consider mainstream entertainment. Or is it?At the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards[3], Parasite made history as the first foreign-language film[4] to win Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The award is essentially SAG's equivalent to Best Picture and is often considered a key predictor for who will win at the Oscars.So, with a SAG Award on its side, is Parasite now the bonafide Best Picture frontrunner?\n Not exactly. The cast of 'Parasite' at the Screen Actors Guild Awards | ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images'Parasite' has been a big winner this awards season Riding a wave of critical buzz \u2014 the film is 99 percent Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes \u2014 Parasite has been a mainstay throughout awards season. However, the film's combination of genres and tones could have made a successful Oscar bid a challenge. After all, the Academy Awards often overlook films it considers too offbeat for such a prestigious honor.Moreover, foreign-language films rarely make it into such high-profile contention. More often than not, such releases \u2014 no matter how beloved \u2014 are relegated to Best Foreign-Language Film, the category just renamed Best International Feature. In the past decade, only 2012's Amour and 2018's Roma have made it into the Best Picture race.So Parasite has already overcome several key obstacles on its way to some major Oscar wins. The film has even earned six nominations and the distinction of being the first South Korean movie nominated in its categories. No wonder HBO is jumping into the Parasite business, with an upcoming series based on the film[5]. America.#PARASITE[6] #SAGawards[7] pic.twitter.com/gb3kpsyKw3[8] \u2014 NEON (@neonrated) January 20, 2020[9] The SAG Award win strengthens its chances at the Oscars Going into the Oscars, insiders take into account all kinds of precursors. These include awards given out by critics' groups, highly publicized ceremonies such as the Golden Globes[10], and the guilds representing actors, directors, producers, and writers from within the industry. That last group of awards-voting bodies, in particular, can often be telling, as the academy's membership often carries a significant overlap.In that respect, Parasite could be in excellent shape going into the Oscars. Its cast's SAG Awards win underscores the film's growing momentum right now. However, in the last decade, only four of the films that won the SAG cast award went on to claim Best Picture at the Oscars. Support for Parasite is clearly in a groundswell right now, but fans of the movie shouldn't lock in their Oscar pools just yet.  Parasite: Award Acceptance Speech | 26th Annual SAG Awards | TNT[11] Oscar's biggest race could still go several different ways While Parasite has gained a bit more traction with its SAG win, the race is far from over right now. In fact, GoldDerby.com[12] has Parasite in a dead heat with two other Best Picture favorites. Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood[13] is still technically the frontrunner. But aside from Brad Pitt's inevitable Best Supporting Actor win, the film seems to be losing ground fast.;More and more, it feels like Best Picture could come down to Parasite and Sam Mendes' war drama 1917. Both Tarantino's film and 1917 won Golden Globes \u2014 for comedy and drama, respectively \u2014 but the latter also won Best Director at that ceremony. Moreover, 1917 beat both Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Parasite at the Producer's Guild of America Awards. Since PGA is the largest guild in the industry, 1917 arguably received a bigger boost than even Parasite's SAG win affords.Plus, since 1917 is by no means an ensemble piece, it makes sense why it wouldn't take the big SAG prize. In other words, Parasite has solidified its place among the top Best Picture players. But it's not over yet. Considering how Bong Joon-ho's movie has exceeded all expectations, we know better than to bet against it though. All eyes will be on what the director's and writer's guilds decide at their respective awards ceremonies.

I knew it was about a family, the Kims, who do their best to leech off of the resources and lifestyle of the wealthy Park family, and that the film won this year's highest honor at the Cannes film festival, but my knowledge of the film really boiled down to rumors and musings that claimed the 2019 release is easily one of the best movies of the decade. Of course, it is common practice to go into the theater without knowing much about the movie you bought tickets for, but I further implore readers to avoid as much information as you can about this movie before going to see it. Your experience will be monumentally elevated by doing so. The rumors and musings are so right: this movie is a must-watch, and it will surprise and delight at every twist and every turn.\nThe cinematic qualities of \"Parasite\" are some of the best I have ever experienced. The camera leads the viewer through the story, effectively contextualizing the characters within their spaces. The set and production design display the Park family and their interactions with the world in a clean, '50s-television-show style. Their home feels inauthentic, like an exhibit in a natural history museum, and this artificiality is painfully juxtaposed by the lived-in semi-basement apartment in which the Kims exist. The actors - led by the entrancing Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-Taek - convey their characters in an 'I couldn't take my eyes off of them' kind of way.\nPerhaps the biggest takeaway from this movie is its urgent discussion about class, particularly how people navigate the obstacles placed in their path by society at large. For instance, the Park family physically distinguishes themselves from the Kims by asserting a difference in their smell. There are moments where the Parks literally turn up their noses at the \"poor person\" smell of the Kims. This reflects a particular attitude toward those deemed inferior: their inferiority is inextricably linked to their physical being. This perspective is sickening and dangerous, and I believe it is what fuels the machine of wealth and power inequality within society. It also embodies a main theme of the film: one's socioeconomic status is socially intended not to be breached, and to attempt a jump up leads to life-altering consequences.\nEvery frame of \"Parasite\" felt fresh. Bong Joon-ho was able to make this movie uniquely his own by employing his exciting style of moviemaking. Every moment creates a new layer and each gets better than the last. Not a single beat is wasted, and every clip is exploited for its full thematic potential. There are not even any \"meh\" moments in the movie. Everything is interconnected, the story is seamless, and the vision is singular. I'm envious of future film students who get to write their Film Studies 101 papers on this movie, as there is not a single point in the film where you cannot unpack engaging cinematographic and thematic content.\nI cannot find a flaw in this movie. When you expend the raw effort it takes to fill each and every frame with such juicy and exciting content, and fill each character with charm and charisma and sadness and pain, you remove any available room for error. This is exactly what Joon-ho accomplished with \"Parasite,\" and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future.\nIf I wasn't hitting you over the head with my trusty \"recommendation mallet\" before, allow me to square up my aim and take another swing: GO SEE THIS FILM."}, {"text": "Apr 03, 2020( Show Tracker: http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/ Delivered by Newstex)  SUNDAYThe special 'Kim Kardashian West: The Justice Project' explores the reality TV star's efforts[1] to spotlight America's mass incarceration crisis. 7 and 9 p.m. OxygenSit a spell, take your shoes off: 'ACM Presents: Our Country[2]' features in-home performances by some of country music's biggest stars, plus a salute to the late, great Kenny Rogers[3]. 8 p.m. CBSThe five-part series 'Atlanta's Missing and Murdered: The Lost Children' looks back at a docuseries of shocking crimes that rocked the city's African American community between 1979 and 1981. 8 p.m. HBO Advertisement An organ-transplant recipient is a lot less grateful then you'd think she'd be in the new thriller 'Black Hearted Killer.'

The Neon dark comedy was immediately met with critical acclaim when it premiered at Cannes and from there, the buzz sustained throughout its festival run and when it was released in the United States it was a box office success.\nThe film became the best-reviewed movie of the year and was praised by critics and audiences, something that was unexpected for Bong.\n\"The film was released in October in the United States with box office results,\" he said backstage at the Golden Globes after his big win. \"I was surprised but thought it was inevitable.\"\nHe added, \"This film is about the rich and poor and about capitalism - and the U.S. is the heart of capitalism. I thought it was a natural response.\"\nJoon Ho talked about how last year the celebrated the centennial of Korean Cinema with the release of Parasite\u00a0and now they mark the 101st year with a Golden Globe win. \"I am very happy to see these achievements year after year,\" he added.\nJoining Bong onstage were actors Kang-ho Song and Jeong-eun Lee and he took the opportunity backstage to say how much of a joy it was to work with the ensemble. \"While parasite has a very political and social message, it is such a familiar and universal story thanks to the incredible charm these actors have.\"\nCheck out the backstage interview below.\nMore from Deadline\nGolden Globes: The Complete Winners List      \u00a0    Shuttlegate: Lost In Beverly Hills Edition, Shoe Valet & More Behind-the-Scenes Golden Globe Moments      \u00a0    Brad Pitt Drops DiCaprio 'Titanic' Quip In Golden Globes Speech: \"I Would've Shared The Raft\""}, {"text": "Bong Joon-ho has won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for his black comic thriller Parasite.\nThe South Korean director is best known for previous films Okja and Snowpiercer, and earned rave reviews for his new film, which is about a poor family who insinuate themselves as servants into a much richer one. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw described it as \"a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama [that] runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character\".\nBong is the first Korean director to have won the top award at Cannes, after last appearing in competition with Okja in 2017. He is the second Asian winner in successive years, after Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda triumphed in 2018 with Shoplifters.\nQuentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood left empty-handed despite widespread critical acclaim, as did another heavyweight director Ken Loach, whose gig-economy drama Sorry We Missed You had made a major impact at the beginning of the festival.\nThe awards ceremony is always brisk, compared to the Oscars, with little time for political pronouncements from the podium. However Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore, as he presented the jury prize, hit out at Donald Trump, quoting painter Pablo Picasso. \"Art is the lie that enables us to realise the truth,\" he said, \"Trump is the lie that enables us more lying.\" Moore added: \"In dark times, art is what has helped save humanity from the autocrats and idiots.\"\nThe Grand Prix - considered the runners-up award - went to Senegalese director Mati Diop for Atlantique, a supernatural drama about African migrants. Diop had atttracted considerable attention before the festival as the first black woman to have a film selected for competition, and her film was a resounding critical success.\nAntonio Banderas was a popular winner of the best actor award for Pedro Almodovar's Pain and Glory ; Banderas played a film-maker clearly modelled on Almodovar himself as he looks back over his career, in which memories of his mother (played by Penelope Cruz) loom large.\nEmily Beecham - the British star of cult hit Daphne - won the best actress award for       \u00a0    Little Joe, a sci-fi parable directed by Austrian film-maker Jessica Hausner. She is the first British actor to win in this category since 1997, when Kathy Burke triumphed for her performance in the Gary Oldman-directed Nil by Mouth.\nBrazilian film Bacurau and       \u00a0    French drama Les Mis\u00e9rables shared the third-place jury prize: the former was jointly directed by Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho and Juliano Dornelle and won plaudits for its anti Jair Bolsonaro message, while the latter, from first time feature director Ladj Ly, was much liked for its portrayal of tough French street life.\nJean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the veteran Belgian film-makers who have previously won the Palme d'Or twice, took home the best director award for their radicalisation drama Young Ahmed, while C\u00e9line Sciamma, considered by many critics a strong contender for the Palme d'Or, was given best screenplay for her 18th-century-set lesbian romance Portrait of a Lady on Fire.\nIn a press conference after the awards ceremony, Bong thanked Cannes for the honour, saying: \"It is the 100th anniversary of cinema in Korea this year. I think that Cannes has given Korean cinema a great gift.\" He also added that he was pleased to hear that the jury had unanimously voted for Parasite to win, and \"as I am a real fan of films it is another reason to be pleased\".\nBong deflected a suggestion that Parasite contained comments aimed at North Korea, saying that an impression of a North Korean TV anchor in the film was \"just a small joke\". \"If North Koreans see my film one day, I think they will laugh.\"\nIn a press conference after the awards ceremony, Banderas joked that the win was \"good news for his cardiologist\" and thanked Alm\u00f3dovar, the director of Pain and Glory and with whom he has worked in seven previous films. \"The award is for the character I played, and that is the alter-ego of Pedro Alm\u00f3dovar. There is something of him here.\" Banderas added: \"I thank him for the years, our movies together.\"\nBeecham appeared somewhat nonplussed at her win, for Jessica Hausner's sci-fi parable Little Joe, saying she had been \"overwhelmed\" by the experience. \"I had a kind of inkling this morning because I had a phone call from [Little Joe's] producer. I had to put my stuff in a backpack and get on a plane.\"\n                   Full list of awards                   \n                     Palme d'Or  Parasite (dir Bong Joon-ho)\n                     Grand Prix  Atlantique (dir Mati Diop)\n                     Best director  Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, Young Ahmed\n                     Best actor  Antonio Banderas, Pain and Glory\n                     Best actress  Emily Beecham, Little Joe\n                     Jury prize (ex aqueo)  Les Mis\u00e9rables (dir Ladj Ly); Bacurau (dir Juliano Dornelles, Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho)\n                     Best screenplay  C\u00e9line Sciamma, Portrait of a Lady on Fire\n                     Special Mention  Elia Suleiman, It Must Be Heaven\n                     Camera d'Or  Our Mothers (dir Cesar Diaz)"}, {"text": "Opening our eyes to a different side of Korean society, this dark comedy is practically perfect\nThe Kim family\n(Supplied)\nKi-jeong (Park So-dam) and Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) pick up a WiFi signal\n(Supplied)\nThe Park matriarch Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong)\n(Supplied)\nIF SIX NOMINATIONS including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the increasingly homogenous American Academy Awards aren't sufficient testament, hopefully our review of one of the greatest movies we have seen in years will persuade you to go watch the Korean work of genius that is Parasite this weekend. And if you believe that opening gambit for an evaluation possesses all the subtlety of a tap dancing elephant, you are not mistaken. When we absolutely adore a picture we want you to know about it. Plus it's fitting for a film which, from minute one, sets out its stall making no attempt to disguise the twisty, quirky, amusing, thrilling tale it is about to sell you.\nLet's try to fill you in on the plot without giving too much away. Officially termed a black comedy, Parasite opens on the Kim family - a highly intuitive yet down-on-their-luck working class clan comprising brother and sister, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and mother and father, Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) and Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). The story begins with the four sharing their cramped Seoul basement apartment searching every corner of the property for a glimmer of nearby WiFi signal to pilfer; the upstairs neighbours at that moment inconsiderately password-protecting their broadband and mobile provisions having long since been cut off. The siblings happen across a caf\u00e9's free service, only reachable from the bathroom, and the two crouch by the toilet downloading messages. Meanwhile mum and dad settle down to folding pizza boxes, from which the only current meagre income stems. Ki-woo's friend Min (Park Seo-joon) soon arrives and the Kims' lives will never be the same again.\nMin, a college student and tutor, is moving abroad and suggests Ki-woo takes over his English teaching gig at a wealthy family's uptown pad. Despite his lack of qualifications (easily sorted with the help of sister Ki-jeong's Photoshop forgery skills), our charming hero lands the position and enters the Park household. Na\u00efve but sweet matriarch Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) rules the roost, caring deeply for her teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jeong Ji-so) whom Ki-woo is going to instruct, and young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). When it is discovered the primary school lad is in need of an art teacher, Ki-woo 'may just know a highly respected painter who could be available'... Enter Ki-jeong posing as a Chicago-trained art therapist and \"friend of a friend\" who breezily waltzes into the job. What's that? The Parks now need a new driver and housekeeper after a couple of backhanded incidents instigate sudden dismissals? The Kim parents (although their real identities are kept confidential) happen to be available and come to the rescue. Quick as a flash the cunning collective have fully implanted themselves into the Parks' lives, are living off generous salaries, and life couldn't be sweeter. That is until one night an unexpected guest threatens to reveal their ruse.\nWe have heard Parasite termed a 'heist movie' and we'd have to agree. Despite the lack of car chases and explosions, the first hour where the various scams are planned are up there with the great con films of our time. The acting across the board is so utterly on point, the Kim group phenomenally manage to pull a Breaking Bad and have you rooting for their nefarious deeds in an instant. As a result of motives not being too dastardly (opinions may vary) you don't mind the Parks being taken for a ride and can't help but hope the Kims' scheme isn't uncovered.\nFrom a grander perspective, Parasite illustrates Korea's societal divisions of which we were unaware. Having only really been superficially exposed to the wealthier elite aspects of the country's more modern culture (here embodied by the Parks), it was inevitable there would be those left behind and it was refreshing to see them represented on the big screen through the Kims in a comedic yet nuanced manner. It is a credit to Bong Joon-ho's direction and writing we came away from his movie not only having been thoroughly entertained, but also enlightened.\nOur rating: 4.5/5\ndavid@khaleejtimes.com \nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/100/157909861972.jpeg\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/15/157909862006.jpeg\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/28/44/96/157909862061.jpeg"}, {"text": "From the moment of Parasite's world premiere in Cannes, in which a usually stoic European audience hooted and hollered at       \u00a0    Bong Joon-ho's movie's twists and turns as though it was a midnight screening in Austin, the film's trajectory has been breakneck. It would go on to win the Palme d'Or, before traveling to festivals the world over and being greeted by audiences with as much fervor as those first screenings. Now, director Bong is nominated for Best Director at the Globes, and Parasite looks set to break out of the international feature race and into Oscar's main competition.\nDEADLINE: Is it true that Parasite began as a play?\nBONG JOON-HO: It is true that I first conceived of this idea as theater, but from the very beginning, it didn't work out that way. From the first line, I was already thinking about the camera positions. I just realized that I had to do this as a film, as always.\nDEADLINE: Where did you get the idea? \nJOON-HO: Actually, in the case of The Host, one of my previous movies, I had a very clear beginning point. But in this case, it's much harder to describe how and when it came to be. It was something like a parasite; it was already inside. I just kind of discovered it. Normally, we don't know when and how a parasite comes into us, so it was a quite similar thing.\nIn 2013, during the post-production of Snowpiercer, I have a very clear, early memory of describing this story to someone else. A story about two families-one rich, one poor-where the poor family infiltrates the rich house, at the very beginning.\nDEADLINE: Frequently in your films, you plant thematic material to explore within allegory, or within a certain genre. What comes first, the theme or the genre?\nJOON-HO: I never really define the genre that I want the story to be in, or what metaphors or symbols I should place within the story. I always just want to depict very interesting and entertaining situations. I move through impulses.\nActually, in the movie, when the young son gets that strange, colored stone, he himself says, \"Wow, this is very metaphorical.\" [laughs] Usually, it's the film critics who say, \"Wow, that was so metaphorical,\" but you have the actor up there, announcing it himself. So, it's very strange. That stone becomes something very important in the film, and I tend to not like symbols. I wanted this film to feel more physical.\nDEADLINE: It's true, though, that the film explores deep themes like socioeconomic inequality. Is striking this kind of balance between meaning and entertainment important for you?\nJOON-HO: For me, instinctively, humor and fun are like the air I breathe. Whenever I work, there's always humor, and alongside that comes drama. I always try to maintain those elements, but I always want to hide some very sharp blade inside the social message, or something political. Something very crucial and sharp is inside there, to spark the audience's thought.\nDEADLINE: From your perspective, is the message of Parasite for Korea, or something more global?\nJOON-HO:\u00a0Very global, very universal. It's almost everywhere, in any country. On the surface, there's so many funny, very Korean details; so many Korean nuances. But it's very strongly, firmly based on a universal subject and theme.\nDEADLINE: How did the Kims and the Parks come together in your mind? \nJOON-HO: It was like laying bricks, one-by-one. So, the Kim family is unemployed. They're completely capable and smart, but they just don't have jobs, and that's the sad part. They're poor, but at the same time, they're very intimate. They like to spend time with one another. And then the rich family, the Parks, was mirrored off of the poor family-four family members, one to one, daughter and son. But they're rarely together.\nDEADLINE: The rich house feels like an island; isolated above all the poorer structures below. \nJOON-HO: The rich house is a very important element in the film, and I really discussed it a lot with the production designer, Ha-jun Lee. Of course, the house has a lot of secrets. When we see it for the first time, it has to feel extravagant and beautiful, but it also has to feel like it doesn't carry any secrets, so that it's surprising.\nDEADLINE: Dark, gothic, classical houses often major roles in horror movies. By contrast, the rich house in Parasite is bright and modern. Were you deliberately subverting what we expect?\nJOON-HO: Yeah, that is what I intended. Of course, the house is the work of a very famous architect, and it features in a very elegant way in the film. You first begin with bright sunlight, and then you delve deeper into the darkness of the house, like you're going inside a cave. The horror element really comes into the picture in the latter half of the film. At first, it just looks like a really beautiful estate.\nBecause 90% of the film happens in the rich house, with the poor house below, ever since I started writing the script, I did a lot of sketches of the basic structures. So, when I finished the script and handed it to the production designer, I also handed him my sketches, and told him that these structures were necessary for the blocking.\nBut the production designer had to consult an actual architect to design this house, and when the architect saw my sketches, he was like, \"No idiot would build houses this way. This is ridiculous.\" So, the production designer came back to me and I kept saying, \"I need this structure! I need this blocking line.\"\nBut the production designer was incredible. He suffered, in between me and the architect. But in the end, he managed to get approval from the architect, while giving me everything that I wanted and required. The house came out amazing.\nDEADLINE: What was it like to share Parasite for the first time at its Cannes premiere?\nJOON-HO: I was very shocked at Cannes. They applauded in the middle of the movie, two times. It was very strange. Then, after that in places like Sydney and Hanoi and Toronto, the same thing happened, again and again. At the end of that one sequence, when Song [Kang-ho] brings out the bloody tissue paper, people started clapping. It was a very strange feeling; it felt like a live concert.\nDEADLINE: You'd had strange experiences in Cannes before. When you premiered Okja there in 2017, the film got caught up in the controversy surrounding Netflix's first time on the Croisette.\nJOON-HO: Yeah, exactly. It was very hard to talk about the movie itself. People were always talking about the streaming thing, the tension between the French theater industry and streaming services. It's very much better to be talking about the film this time around.\nOkja was my first time in competition, so that's something. But because the controversy was so severe, it was an exhausting experience. In Toronto this year, I met director Noah Baumbach. At Cannes in 2017, his movie The Meyerowitz Stories was the other Netflix movie in competition, so we shared the same situation. He's made another movie with Netflix this year, of course. I asked him, \"How's this year?\" He said he was having a great time and it's getting better and better. Netflix is now more flexible, so Marriage Story is showing for longer in theaters, exclusively, before streaming. I think at the time, 2017, the feeling was it was too early.\nI really want to work with Netflix again, if I have a chance. It was a great experience. They gave me 100%, total creative control to release my director's cut, which is quite rare in this industry.\nDEADLINE: I had wondered if the Netflix/Cannes debate, on top of your experiences with Harvey Weinstein on Snowpiercer, would put you off of the idea of working in America again.\nJOON-HO: I consider Netflix great friends, and working on Snowpiercer and Okja has given me the opportunity to work and communicate with a lot of filmmakers and actors from Europe and the U.S. So now, I have a wider range of collaborators with whom I can work, and I will continue making Korean films like Parasite, also. But actually, I'm just very dependent on the story, what kind of story I'm going to make. That's the basic thing, not where I'll make it. It's not like, \"Oh, one film, I'll do in the U.S., and one film, I'll do in Korea.\"\nMore from Deadline\nOscars: International Feature Film Shortlist Includes 'Parasite', 'Pain And Glory', 'Les Mis\u00e9rables'      \u00a0    Director Todd Douglas Miller On Surmounting Technical Challenges, Overcoming \"Space Fatigue\" For Oscar-Shortlisted Doc 'Apollo 11'      \u00a0    'Dracula' Ratings: Rave Reviews Can't Stem Loss Of UK Viewers Ahead Of Global Netflix Release"}, {"text": "Amazon Prime Video has announced that\u00a0Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Best Picture Oscar winner Parasite is coming to the streaming service this month. \n\u2022\tRead more: Parasite review: Bong Joon-ho\u2019s darkly comic thriller is a modern masterpiece (yes, even with subtitles)\nSharing the names of several titles that will be coming to Amazon Prime in the UK throughout October, the streamer also revealed that Sam Mendes\u2019 war drama 1917 would be added to the service. \n1917\u00a0will arrive on October 16, with Parasite following on October 23.

Its narrative engine hums with the luxurious smoothness of the Mercedes-Benz that one character is fatefully given the chance to drive. In my original      \u00a0    review from Cannes, I wondered if the narrative was a little over-extended, but, on a second viewing, I can see how that amplitude of detail is what gives the film its flavour.\nParasite is a scabrous black comedy-slash-farce that resonates beyond its generic limits - a movie about status envy, aspiration, materialism, the patriarchal family unit and the idea of having (or leasing) servants. More than this, it is about the suppressed horror of the overclass for its underlings and its morbid distaste for the smell of people who have to use public transport. The satirical reflex extends to a vision of South and North Korea living together in paranoid, resentful intimacy, and its climax is precipitated by an almost Biblical climate-emergency catastrophe.\nThe parasites in question are a dodgy unemployed family living together in a scuzzy, stinky basement flat, with the teenage son and daughter periodically roaming around, holding their smartphones up to the ceiling to pinch the non-password-protected wifi of neighbours and nearby businesses. The dad is Ki-taek (a lovely performance from veteran player Song Kang-ho), a laidback loafer married to former track star Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin). The son is Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), a shiftless young guy who has flunked the university entrance exams; and the daughter is Ki-jung (Park So-dam), a smart, cool customer with an artistic gift for web-based fraud.\nOne summer, by posing as a college student, Ki-woo gets the chance to tutor the teenage daughter of a very rich family in a spectacularly grand modernist house, owned by business high-flier Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun). Ki-woo's student is the demure Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), whose instant crush on him is something Ki-woo does nothing to discourage. The somewhat distraite mistress of the house, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), asks if this smart young man might also recommend an art tutor for Da-hye's negligibly talented kid brother Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). He passes off his sister as the cousin of a friend and her brazen grifter-sense of when and how to be confident, and even arrogant, bags her the job.\nSoon, these wicked kids have cunningly contrived to get the family chauffeur fired and replaced with their dad. They then dislodge the housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun) and install their placidly smiling mum. A whole family of cuckoos in a brand new nest, pretending to be strangers to each other. But then the artless little kid points out that they all smell alike - and they smell of poor people.\nParasite is a movie that taps into a rich cinematic tradition of unreliable servants with an intimate knowledge of their employers, an intimacy that easily, and inevitably, congeals into hostility. Joseph Losey's The Servant invokes a comparable transgression, nightmarishly amplified here by the subterfuge and by the sheer numbers of people getting up close and personal.\nParasite is also in a Korean tradition of pictures such as Kim Ki-young's classic thriller The Housemaid from 1960, remade in 2010 by Im Sang-soo, and also Park Chan-wook's servant-class con-trick drama, The Handmaiden. A second viewing of this film also put me in mind of the claustrophobic horror in Park's       \u00a0    Oldboy.\nAnd there is something else, too. The Park family love to play Handel on the music system in their lovely home - the Spietati, io vi giurai aria from his opera Rodelinde. It is so expansive, so airy, caressingly sumptuous and wealthy, and not a million miles from the Care selve arioso from Handel's Atalanta - listened to by the smug wealthy couple in Michael Haneke's home-invasion horror Funny Games, before their own appointment with dark destiny.\nThe home invaders here gaze on their super-rich employers and see themselves in a distorting mirror that pitilessly reveals to them how wretched they are and shows them what could and should be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story: the invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its toxic tendrils into your skin.\n Parasite is released in the UK on 7 February."}, {"text": "Feb 06, 2020( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  This year's Oscar race is defined by a diversified Academy membership, now nearing 20 percent international; a shortened award season that put increased pressure on the Academy members to sample all the nominees, often online; and the always-confusing preferential ballot.

In the decade since adopting the preferential ballot, the Academy has leaned into message movies like #8216;12 Years a Slave,#8217; #8216;Spotlight,#8217; #8216;The Shape of Water,#8217; #8216;Moonlight,#8217; and #8216;Green Book#8217; \u2014 despite their modest box office \u2014 over feel-good entertainments such as #8216;La La Land#8217; and #8216;A Star is Born#8217; or big-scale visual epics like #8216;The Revenant,#8217; #8216;Mad Max: Fury Road,#8217; #8216;Dunkirk,#8217; and #8216;Gravity.#8217; Tallying guild wins still offers insight into Academy voters, but since 2016 the Academy has actively altered its membership far more than any of the guilds, including the oft-predictive SAG, PGA, DGA, WGA, and BAFTA. \nThe Academy may be less L.A.-centric, and predominantly white male, than those organizations, but it is still dominated by older white men who live in Hollywood, many of whom voted last year for middle-of-the-road, feel-good studio entry #8216;Green Book.#8217; Only 32 percent of the Academy[1] is women and 16 percent is nonwhite, a figure that includes European Spanish speakers. However, if the Academy is still dominated by thesteakeater vote,[2] it's spread around several movies, including nominations leader Todd Phillips' divisive, Venice Golden-Lion winning #8216;Joker#8217; (11 nods), which should easily take Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix. Also in that number: James Mangold's racecar spectacular #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; (four noms), which should win some tech nods, most likely the two sound categories; and Martin Scorsese's mafia-vs.-Hoffa saga #8216;The Irishman#8217; (10 nominations, Netflix), which could go home empty handed. Two other popular movies will draw that mainstream vote: #8216;1917[3]#8217; and #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,#8217; with 10 nominations each. Heading into the home stretch, they are duking it out for Best Picture with Bong Joon Ho's Korean-movie-that-could #8216;Parasite[4]#8217; (six nominations). The Cannes Palme d'Or, SAG, and WGA-winning #8216;Parasite#8217; could break the long-held conventional wisdom that a subtitled foreign-language movie cannot win Best Picture (it has failed to happen 11 times, including last year's #8216;Roma#8217;). While it's easy to measure the movie's word-of-mouth popularity and box-office traction[5] ($165.4 million worldwide), will mainstream older voters recognize an out-of-the-box story about a family of con-artists \u2014 especially when the movie can also win Best International Feature Film? The answer: They could, even if that's not their express desire. It all comes down to that confounding preferential ballot. If enough people rank #8216;Parasite#8217; high on their ballots (it is not true that only the top two votes count), it could win Best Picture. The movie could also pick up wins for director, original screenplay, production design, and editing. More than any other nominee, #8216;Parasite#8217; hits the zeitgeist with its portrayal of the global class struggle between the haves and have-nots; it may be time to break this Oscar rule. Sam Mendes' continuous-shot World War I drama #8216;1917#8217; won the Drama Globe, PGA, DGA, and BAFTA, and has box-office momentum[6] as well as anti-war gravitas behind it. Oddly, the film is viewed by some as a mainstream conventional choice, and others as an innovative technological feat. DGA winner Mendes and ASC winner Roger Deakins should both win their second Oscars[7] for direction and cinematography, respectively, along with other possible craft wins. The movie is passionately admired, its message unassailable, and actors recognize what its two young rising stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman accomplished over multiple long takes. #8216;1917#8217; could win. Quentin Tarantino's summer hit #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; won the Critics Choice Award and boasts broad support from actors, writers, and crafts. Like #8216;A Star is Born#8217; last year, this much-beloved show business fable peaked early and lost some mojo, except for inevitable Supporting Actor sweeper Brad Pitt and Tarantino's possible third screenplay win, along with some crafts. But there is real affection for this inside-Hollywood movie, which Academy members well understand \u2014 which is why #8216;The Artist#8217; and #8216;Birdman#8217; both won Best Picture. Triple-threat New Zealander Taika Waititi's archly humorous WGA and BAFTA-winner #8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217; (six nominations) stands a strong chance in several categories, including Adapted Screenplay and Costume (the latter of which also marks the most likely win out of the six nominations for #8216;Little Women#8217;). Don't forget, #8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217; won the predictive Toronto People's Choice Award; it's unlikely to repeat the #8216;Green Book#8217; Best Picture win, but it's also a mainstream favorite. Its fans will want it to win something. Losing momentum is nominations leader Netflix (24 nominations), which continues to come under fire[8] for its awards strategy. Certainly studios are angry at the disruptive streamer's willingness to outspend them on movies they weren't willing to support at a high level, such as Martin Scorsese's $160-million, VFX-loaded, three-and-a-half hour gangster epic #8216;The Irishman.#8217; But the evolving Netflix release model (launch a movie at film festivals, a three-week platform release in arthouses, expand onto the global streaming platform) meant that at the end of the Oscar season, #8216;The Irishman,#8217; Noah Baumbach's divorce dramedy #8216;Marriage Story#8217; (six nominations) and Fernando Meirelles' theological debate #8216;The Two Popes#8217; (three) all lost steam \u2014 no matter how hard the Netflix awards team tried to keep them in the conversation via fluffy sofa throws or red pope slippers[9]. While Netflix won three out of 10 Oscars for #8216;Roma#8217; last year, this time it may have to settle for Supporting Actress Laura Dern in #8216;Marriage Story#8217; and their third documentary win, for #8216;American Factory.#8217; Not winning any popularity contests are the leaders of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences who decreed a three-weeks-shorter Oscar season, with the show taking place on February 9. Voters rushed to view animated, foreign-language, documentary, and short films, and crashed the Oscars website the day before ballots were due. Many members complained about not being able to see everything in time, as well as having to watch so many films online. They weren't warned that they would no longer be sent the DVD shorts package, and members who did not have Apple TV had to watch many entries on their computers. Luckily, Oscar dates return to their late-February normal next year. First-time Oscar producers Stephanie Allain and Lynnette Howell Taylor inherited last year's successful no-host model, and remained controversy-free by not taking any radical steps to shorten the three-hour broadcast. Like last year, ABC should be happy with ratings, as a popular slate of contenders led by $1 billion worldwide grosser #8216;Joker#8217; could be a real draw. One downside of the rise of international Oscar voters is that they are mainly white Europeans, which may partly account for the lack of diversity in this year's nominees. To counteract this, the producers have invited a number of presenters and performers of color, including the only black acting nominee, singer-actress Cynthia Erivo, who will perform her nominated song from #8216;Harriet,#8217; nominee Taika Waititi (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;), past winners Mahershala Ali and Regina King, and singer Janelle Monae, among others. May you win your Oscar pool. My final list of picks in 24 categories is below: Best Picture: #8216;Parasite#8217; Spoiler: #8216;1917\u2033 Bottom Line:The much-debated preferential ballot \u2014 each voter ranks the nine nominees in order of preference \u2014 all comes down to the movies 8,469 Academy voters actually saw and loved the most, and which film aligns with the zeitgeist to deliver the (socially relevant) message that voters want to send. These factors favor SAG Ensemble and WGA-winner #8216;Parasite.#8217; I'm sticking with the fact that Bong nabbed the biggest applause at the Academy nominees luncheon. Best Director: Sam Mendes (#8216;1917#8217;) Spoiler: Bong Joon Ho (#8216;Parasite#8217;) In recent years the directing Oscar has gone to the most extraordinary technical achievement, from Ang Lee's VFX-winner #8216;Life of Pi,#8217; Alfonso Cuaron's #8216;Gravity#8217; and #8216;Roma,#8217; to A.G. Inarritu's #8216;The Revenant.#8217; If any narrative can upset DGA-winner Mendes' astonishing continuous-take drama about two young soldiers pressing forward to the front line under fire to deliver a life-saving message, it's Bong's breakout #8216;Parasite.#8217; If it wins this award, #8216;1917#8217; will likely take Best Picture. Best Actor: Joaquin Phoenix (#8216;Joker#8217;) Spoiler: Adam Driver (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;) Bottom Line: Phoenix is on a tear and is considered crucial to the success of #8216;Joker,#8217; even to the point of improvising key scenes on set with Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher \u2014 and driving his hair and makeup team crazy. But he campaigned like a pro, throwing his authentic political beliefs into the mix[10] in a positive way. But Driver is this year's respected thespian emoter: Charlie not only breaks down movingly at the feet of his estranged wife (Scarlett Johansson), but alsosings Stephen Sondheim's #8216;Being Alive.#8217; Driver is young and has many Oscar chances ahead of him. Best Actress: ReneZellweger (#8216;Judy#8217;) Spoiler: Scarlett Johansson (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;) Bottom Line:After four nominations and one win (#8216;Cold Mountain#8217;), Globe, SAG, Critics Choice and BAFTA sweeper Zellweger, 50, has the career advantage; voters who checked out #8216;Judy#8217; did not find her wanting. After never having been nominated before, Johansson landed two nods, as an actress divorcing her director husband in #8216;Marriage Story,#8217; and as a young Nazi's activist mother in #8216;Jojo Rabbit.#8217; Both Best Picture contenders scored better reviews than #8216;Judy,#8217; but Zellweger's comeback narrative[11] is irresistible. Best Supporting Actor: Brad Pitt (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Spoiler: Anthony Hopkins (#8216;The Two Popes#8217;) Bottom Line: Nobody can possibly catch up with Pitt's performance as moccasin-wearing zen stuntman Cliff Booth, nor his awards circuit charm offensive[12] (including witty, self-deprecating speeches \u2014 his ghost writer earned their fee \u2014 and hand-holding with his ex, Jennifer Aniston). While #8216;The Two Popes#8217; is an unsung actor-fest that many voters love, Oscar voters want this key win for #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Best Supporting Actress: Laura Dern (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;) Spoiler: Scarlett Johansson (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;) Bottom Line: Again, Hollywood scion Dern has swept all the precursor races on the strength of her performance as a hard-as-nails feminist lawyer \u2014 a performance buttressed by her strong showings in a second Best Picture nominee, #8216;Little Women,#8217; and HBO Emmy-winner #8216;Big Little Lies.#8217; Again, first-time dual nominee Johansson effortlessly delivers a strong German accent, period costumes, and heartbreak as Jojo's tragic mom. If there's a surprise this year, this could be it. Best Original Screenplay: Quentin Tarantino (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Spoiler: Bong Joon Jo (#8216;Parasite#8217;) Tarantino's tone-shifting showbiz dialogue in the elegiac, utterly original #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; deserves the win. It's close, though: It would be his third win in this category, and while Tarantino wasn't eligible for the WGA award because he never joined, he could have used the momentum boost that went to Bong. Especially if voters withhold the Best Picture win, they may want Bong to win another big award. Best Adapted Screenplay: Taika Waititi (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;) Spoiler: Greta Gerwig (#8216;Little Women#8217;) Bottom Line:Again, two narratives are duking it out: the brilliantly constructed Louisa May Alcott adaptation penned by actress-writer-director and Critics' Choice winner Gerwig, who gains sympathy by being denied a director's nod (see Ben Affleck and #8216;Argo#8217;), and the brilliantly constructed Hitler satire from actor-writer-director and WGA and BAFTA-winner Waititi, who also gains sympathy by being denied a director's nod. Both films are commercial hits, and both screenwriters are able self-promoters with diversity cred. Best Animated Feature: #8216;Toy Story 4\u2033 Spoiler: #8216;Klaus#8217; Bottom Line: It seemed like a done deal that Josh Cooley would win for Pixar's latest #8216;Toy Story#8217; sequel, which managed to surpass the Oscar-winning third installment. But somehow, other movies have been winning. New animation competitor Netflix took the Annie Awards with hand-drawn Christmas origin myth #8216;Klaus,#8217; while their adult French Cannes pickup #8216;I Lost By Body#8217; has been promoted by last year's winners, Phil Lord and Chris Miller (#8216;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse#8217;). While some feel that the Oscars should share the love, and Pixar has won enough, the smaller films could weed each other out, leaving the most popular title in the lead: #8216;Toy Story 4.#8217; Best Animated Short: #8216;Hair Love#8217; Spoiler:#8216;Memorable#8217; Bottom Line: The advantage[13] goes to the most-accessible entry, which this year is the 2D #8216;Hair Love,#8217; which poignantly tells the story of a father bonding with his daughter on a bad-hair day. Financed via Kickstarter and acquired by Sony Pictures Animation, it's directed by black filmmaker Matthew Cherry and animated by Everett Downing Jr. (#8216;Up,#8217; #8216;WALLE#8217;) and Bruce Smith (creator of #8216;The Proud Family#8217;). On the other hand, Academy voters may relate to Bruno Collet's moving French stop-motion short #8216;Memorable,#8217; which is both well-wrought and artful, as it uses a painterly palette to portray an artist's descent into Alzheimer's. Best Cinematography: Roger Deakins (#8216;1917#8217;) Spoiler: Robert Richardson (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Bottom Line: Deakins deserves huge credit for his collaboration with Mendes on this supremely challenging technological and artistic feat. In any other year, Richardson would walk home with the win for helping Tarantino pull off so many tone shifts for 1969 Hollywood. Best Costume Design: Jacqueline Durran (#8216;Little Women#8217;) Spoiler: Arianne Phillips (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Bottom Line: Given that #8216;Little Women#8217; boasts a colorful range of period costumes, it has emerged as the frontrunner in this category, even without a Costume Designers Guild mention. This could be the film's designated Oscar win. Or, voters may prefer the evocative, now-iconic 1969 costumes for #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Best Documentary Feature: #8216;American Factory#8217; Spoiler:#8216;For Sama#8217; Bottom Line: Cancer survivor Julia Reichert and her life and filmmaking partner Steven Bognar delivered a definitive and revealing essay on the culture clash inside a Chinese-owned glass factory in Ohio. In a competitive field, the likeliest film to challenge the win is IDA-winner #8216;For Sama,#8217; which chronicles a young family under siege in Aleppo. But gorgeously wrought dual nominee, Macedonian #8216;Honeyland,#8217; is also beloved. Best Documentary Short: #8216;Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone (If You're a Girl)#8217; Spoiler: #8216;In the Absence#8217; Bottom Line:Voters respond to the heart-tugging joy of unfettered girls in #8216;Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone.#8217; But #8216;In the Absence,#8217; the story of how the Korean government let trapped passengers in a sinking ferry die, is both well made and haunting. Best Editing: #8216;Parasite#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; Bottom Line: If the complex dual-family multi-genre structures of #8216;Parasite#8217; win early on Oscar night, there could be more gold statuettes in the offing. But the orchestrated action suspense of #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; also deserves a win. Neither one-shot #8216;1917#8217; nor #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; landed a nomination, another sign of strength for #8216;Parasite.#8217; Best International Feature Film: #8216;Parasite#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Pain & Glory#8217; Bottom Line:Many voters want to spread the love, but more will have seen #8216;Parasite,#8217; which would mark a first win for Korea. That's hard to beat. Even though Pedro Almodovar's #8216;Pain & Glory#8217; earned a Best Actor nomination for Cannes prizewinner Antonio Banderas, that doesn't reflect the entire Academy, who don't all watch the foreign films. #8216;Parasite,#8217; they saw. Best Live Action Short:#8216;Brotherhood#8217; Spoiler:#8216;A Sister#8217; Bottom Line:Of the families-in-jeopardy shorts, Meryam Joobeu's #8216;Brotherhood,#8217; about a young man returning home to his angry father after fighting with ISIS in Syria, is movingly directed, but Delphine Girard's thriller #8217;A Sister,#8217; about a policewoman trying to save a young woman in danger over the phone, is the one that is not like the others. Best Makeup and Hairstyling: #8216;Bombshell#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Joker#8217; Bottom Line: The Best Actress contender gets the win, given all the high praise for the transformation of Charlize Theron into Fox News anchorwoman Megyn Kelly. But many folks don't like that movie, and the #8216;Joker#8217; makeup and hairstyling team earned extra points for managing their volatile star. Best Production Design: Barbara Ling (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Spoiler: Dennis Gassner (#8216;1917#8217;) Bottom Line: This one is close. Many are lauding the hand-in-hand coordinated effort required for Mendes, Deakins, and Gassner to lay out and build their extraordinary long take shots. But Ling's recreation of many different sides of 1969 Hollywood won the Art Directors Guild award for period, while #8216;Parasite#8217; took contemporary, which doesn't usually win in this category. If either film wins both Production Design and Best Picture, they will be the first to win both. Best Original Score: Hildur Guonadottir (#8216;Joker#8217;) Spoiler: Thomas Newman (#8216;1917#8217;) Bottom Line: First-time nominee Guonadottir's jarring modern #8216;Joker#8217; score is so strong (even influencing Phoenix's performance) that it could beat #8216;1917#8217; composer Thomas Newman, who is long overdue after 13 nominations and no wins. Best Original Song: #8216;I'm Gonna Love Me Tonight#8217; (Elton John and Bernie Taupin, #8216;Rocketman#8217;) Spoiler: #8216;Stand Up#8217; (Cynthia Erivo, #8216;Harriet#8217;) Bottom Line: While Tony, Grammy and Emmy-winner Erivo is well on her way to EGOT status, this is Elton John's win for the hugely popular but under-recognized biopic musical #8216;Rocketman.#8217; Best Sound Editing: #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; Spoiler: #8216;1917#8217; Bottom Line: Both sound teams faced challenges as they found way to innovate under duress. I'm going with the sound guild-winning percussive sound design for the #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; races, but this one is hard to call. Best Sound Mixing: #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; Spoiler: #8216;1917#8217; Bottom Line: Again, the guild-winning sound team went beyond the call of duty as they recorded the interiors of arcane vintage race cars. But #8216;1917#8217; was also a sound-mixing feat. Best Visual Effects: #8216;1917#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Avengers: Endgame#8217; Bottom Line: After #8216;Black Panther,#8217; Marvel has developed a taste for awards, and campaigned for #8216;Endgame.#8217; #8216;Infinity Wars#8217; lost last year, so there may be votes this time for the finale, as Thanos and Hulk are among the great animated characters of all time \u2014 not to mention that big-scale battle. Finally, though, while the effects in #8216;1917#8217; are less showy and more invisible, they were essential to pulling off the seamless movie, from completing the production design to hurling George MacKay into a raging river to throwing an exploding airplane into a barn. Like last year's VFX winner #8216;First Man,#8217; the classier movie could take the win.

This was a lackluster year. I struggled to come up with five. We know the Academy is all about the actors, the largest group of people who dominate and decide everything!\n #8216;Parasite[1].#8217; It's an invigorating movie to watch. Bong Joon Ho took me places I didn't think I was going to go. The performances are great. The story it told at this moment in time of the haves and have-nots was fascinating. The humor, we need humor! In all this grimness. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; has humor within the story. Even #8216;The Irishman#8217; has moments of humor; it helps to leaven the grimness. I liked #8216;Parasite#8217; the best. I'd vote for something else for Best International Feature Film. #8216;The Irishman.#8217; The performances were great; you got inside the head of a murderer, and how he evolved. Marty Scorsese is a deft director \u2014 you put yourself in his hands and you have an excellent journey. I did watch it in the theater at 11 a.m. so as not to fall asleep. It was three-and-a-half hours long, but I was gripped. #8216;Little Women[2].#8217; I don't have as much invested as other people I know; it wasn't a book I grew up with and adored. I came to it with a cleaner slate. I wasn't as upset with the feminist changes Greta Gerwig made \u2014 I enjoyed it. The performances were entertaining! I had problems with the backwards and forwards construction; I found it confusing and not necessary. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; I loved the #8216;what if?#8217; conceit of the movie; it was brilliant. Quentin Tarantino's gratuitous violence turns me off. I sit there with my hands over my eyes. #8216;Jojo Rabbit.#8217; It was a brilliant conceit, and the performances were great. I couldn't quite get into it; it's tough. Not because Taika Waititi's making fun of Hitler and the history of Nazis \u2014 it was a leap I didn't entirely make \u2014 but I was watching from a distance, in a way. #8216;Marriage Story.#8217; I like Noah Baumbach's movies generally, but he lost me, because suddenly this guy who runs this podunk theater in New York has enough money to hire a big lawyer and rent an apartment in LA, fly backwards and forwards? That stepped out of reality for me. I didn't believe the characters anymore. It's such a kitchen-sink story. I went with the stuff about why they're splitting up, but the minute it became a divorce saga of expensive lawyers vying with each other, I didn't care, I didn't believe it anymore. It was sad. #8216;1917.#8217; Manohla Dargis said it the best[3]. It was pretentious and lengthy and Richard Brody[4] did a good critique of it; the story is limited and one-note. I was watching this clever trick of doing the supposed one shot throughout the movie, which of course it isn't. I grew a bit bored by it. It was very real \u2014 I'm interested in that period and stories of men in that war \u2014 but I was disappointed. #8216;Joker.#8217; I was beaten on the head over and over again. I didn't want to be there with these people. #8216;King of Comedy#8217; had gone into that territory and done it better. It was too unpleasant, and I don't know the purpose of it. Maybe it's a reflection of our society, but I see Trump on TV every day and I don't need this.Best DirectorMartin Scorsese. It's a lifetime achievement thing with him. I don't know that #8216;The Irishman#8217; is my favorite movie of his. He's such an excellent director. Bong Joon Ho. That's a dilemma. It's a very close first, if I could vote for two. I can't stand the idea of Quentin Tarantino up there banging on. The ego, the ego!Best ActorThey're all really good actors; that's not the issue. it's whether their moments in the films moved me or I felt galvanized by them. Jonathan Pryce. I voted for #8216;The Two Popes#8217; as one of my favorite movies of the year. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It was a smart movie. I'd give it to Pryce, with Antonio a close second. Antonio Banderas. I didn't love that movie as much as other Pedro Almod\u00f3var movies. Adam Driver. I am in love with him, but how much I didn't like the movie supersedes the performance. I can't disassociate.Best ActressI'm not thrilled by any of them. I don't know who I would have put in instead . Saoirse Ronan is really good; I liked #8216;Little Women#8217; more than the other films. Rene Zellweger. I didn't love #8216;Judy.#8217; It's a shame she sang. Bob Ackerman's #8216;Judy#8217; was fine with Judy Davis. Cynthia Erivo.I didn't love #8216;Harriet.#8217; Charlize Theron. At the end of #8216;Bombshell#8217; I didn't know who these women were and what really motivated them.Best Supporting ActorTom Hanks (#8216;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood#8217;). I was nervous about seeing him do that. He walked a fine line between imitating someone, which gets old, and doing an interpretation, particularly with such a recognizable voice and cadence. It could get annoying. So I give him props for that. Brad Pitt (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;). I might have to vote for him for sheer lust.Pitt gave a nuanced performance, as he did in #8216;Thelma and Louise.#8217; He has the chops. But his looks are distracting and take away from his ability to perform. You get seduced and distracted by that. Anthony Hopkins (#8216;The Two Popes#8217;). What was so clever was their foreign accents, which were enough to understand that they came from someplace else and where, but it wasn't overwhelming. Anthony gave a refined low-key performance that was nice to see. Al Pacino and Joe Pesci (#8216;The Irishman#8217;). With Al, the hair was distracting. When you are looking at a big screen it takes up a lot of space. He's better than he has been in a while, not chewing up the scenery as much as he can. I'm glad they were in the movie; they augmented it. I didn't feel so moved by their performances; I appreciated them.Supporting ActressScarlett Johansson (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;). She had quite a range in that role, from being charming, to being caught in a bad situation and trying to deal with this impossible world, which was not exactly surprising from her but unexpected. She had an accent, she was real, this person existed in this fantasy world the director had created. That's important: she had that base that you can hang onto as you go for the ride. Kathy Bates (#8216;Richard Jewell#8217;). Her performance is pretty amazing, and moving. I really cared about this woman. She captured that maternal angst [and] I can identify with, God forbid, being powerless to do anything about [what's happening to your child]. Margot Robbie (#8216;Bombshell#8217;). She was so good in #8216;I, Tonya.#8217; I can't fault her, again. That moment in the office with John Lithgow is extraordinary. You viscerally feel what she's going through, what she's on the verge of capitulating to. Laura Dern (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;). My dislike of the movie overrides her performance for me. Florence Pugh (#8216;Little Women#8217;). I wasn't knocked out.Adapted ScreenplayAnthony McCarten (#8216;The Two Popes#8217;). This excellent story well told was given short shrift. It's a complicated story he was telling, with the trick of how you portray people who are still alive. He did it really powerfully. The flashbacks integrated into the movie were well done.Original Screenplay#8216;Parasite.#8217; It's so original, clever, and brilliant.Costume Design#8216;Jojo Rabbit.#8217; It's historically accurate; there's a twist on the costumes, they are reflections of the story, which is a fantasy in some ways. The costumes are a little extreme, not what everyday people in Germany would be wearing. They have a toe in reality, so they're not totally outrageous. The designer took it that extra step, which melded with the tone of the movie. I hope that one wins. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Arianne Phillips did a great job with the costumes. They are very textured, with lots of variety \u2014 there's hippies, and the more stylish, sophisticated looks for Sharon Tate. It wasn't too kitschy. Sometimes period stuff can get too obvious. There was a range she covered, pretty accurately, with subtlety. The clothes looked worn, they were a bit funky, crumpled. They weren't pulled freshly out of dry-cleaning bags, but reflected the way Brad Pitt lived in that trailer. Things were not spick and span. There was a variety of looks appropriate for each character, like Leonardo's leisure suit. Things repeated a bit, again how people really wear their clothing. It's not a new outfit every time; people have a uniform they wear. #8216;Little Women.#8217; I went with the costumes. Greta was giving us a rose-tinted view of the world they lived in, which is true of a lot of period films. The hair and makeup can make or break it; if you go over the top, it takes away from the costumes, it distracts you. That's not good. Laura Dern would never have hair like that. These people bathed once a month, plus all that food on the table! They were living in the land of plenty. The hair did them in. If the hair been more realistic it would have dialed down everything. #8216;Knives Out.#8217; Contemporary films often get short shrift. I was pleased it also got the CDG [Costume Designers Guild] prize. It was witty, and the costumes reflected the tone of the movie: that's what a good costume should do, as well as interpret the character. #8216;The Irishman.#8217; Sandy Powell, she's great. But how many Oscars[5] does she need? Spread it around a little. If I don't like the movie, it's hard for me to separate the movie from the costumes. #8216;Joker.#8217; Joaquin Phoenix was terrific, but the movie left me cold. So, I'm less enthusiastic about the costumes. Also, Mark Bridges has won a couple of Oscars.International Feature Film#8216;Honeyland#8217; (Macedonia). It's a gripping documentary about the extraordinary world of this woman, her life, and these people invading, how they take over and almost destroy her, and how she survives. It's a mirror, again, of what's going on in the world. Everything is different in this very remote place, but no, it's filled with humans who behave badly, just like everywhere. And it's touching because she tried to be a good Samaritan and the kids do nothing but abuse her. What's clever about it: you also feel for the family, they're trying to survive, they're being stupid about it, they're mistaken about what they're doing, which leads to disaster. They could have gotten on together and been all right, but the guy gets too greedy. And it all falls apart. It's an extraordinary movie. #8216;Parasite#8217; (South Korea). If you're going to compete in Best Picture you shouldn't be in Best International Film Feature; that takes an opportunity away from someone else. It's double-dipping. What about all those poor foreign movies? #8216;Parasite#8217; got an insane amount of publicity \u2014 how do you compete with that? To be in too many categories is not fair. If the Academy Awards do in fact mean something and can help a movie make money, let's give that opportunity to as many people as we can.Documentary Feature#8216;For Sama.#8217; I went to a small screening. [Waad Al-Kateab] was there with the guy [Edward Watts] who helped put it together. I was weeping. For the sheer emotional experience you can't beat #8216;For Sama.#8217; It takes us out into this world we can't even imagine. That they stayed [in Aleppo] trying to do good, while they jeopardized their lives and their daughter, is a kind of bravery beyond my comprehension. It's an important story to get out: what goes on in these countries we're toying with, not giving aid to, or [where we're] backing the wrong person. #8216;American Factory#8217; is incredible, an excellent documentary that also tells the story of something really important.Cinematography#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217;Robert Richardson has won a ton but he's a great cinematographer. #8216;1917#8217; looked gorgeous but I didn't like the movie. #8216;The Lighthouse.#8217; I hated the movie, it could have taken an hour or so, but went on and on in such bleakness. It was visually extraordinary. With a movie like that, I often think, #8216;the poor cast and crew, such a miserable shoot!#8217; #8216;The Irishman#8217; had a good look, but that weird CGI stuff making actors look younger was distracting, which was not [Rodrigo Prieto]'s fault.EditingIt was between #8216;Parasite#8217; and #8216;The Irishman.#8217; Thelma Schoonmaker deserves it for dealing with Marty. If she had never won I'd vote for her [she has won three times]. #8216;Ford v Ferrari.#8217; The race sequences were confusing. I couldn't tell which car was the car I was meant to be watching.Makeup and Hairstyling#8216;1917#8217; has excellent wounds and horrible things: the distress of the human body going through war. #8216;Judy#8217; was not a standout for what they did to Rene. That's what's good about it; you're not distracted by it which would have been bad. #8216;Bombshell.#8217; They did such an amazing job of making Charlize Theron look like Megyn Kelly that it's almost creepy.Production Design#8216;Parasite#8217; was fantastic, that world he created, between the horrible apartment and the fancy house, and then the surprise dungeon. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Barbara Ling's period stuff was more spectacular. She recreated things that don't exist anymore, taking familiar landmarks and seeing them through period eyes. #8216;1917.#8217; The production design of Dennis Gassner was amazing. #8216;The Irishman#8217; had a nitty gritty, grim very real look to it; the color palette was dowdy and sad.

The movie itself, however, doesn't put the country in a particularly positive light.\nNo doubt, the international acclaim for \"Parasite,\" which also won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, highlights South Korea's emergence as a global cultural power, a reflection of decades of focus on building world-class industries in one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia.\nBut it also hints at an uncomfortable truth: While the national successes have been spectacular - from Samsung's rise as a global economic powerhouse to the explosion of K-pop in Asia and beyond - many South Koreans recognize that there's been a dark side to that rise. Only a few years ago, Bong himself was blacklisted by the government, and the characters in his film reflect a society where many feel intense hopelessness.\nSouth Korea's rapid emergence from the devastation of the 1950-53 Korean War also saw a bloody transition from dictatorship to democracy. Its association with neat smartphones and cars came amid a constant threat from nuclear North Korea. For every international success, there's also widespread worry that South Korea will forever be overshadowed by regional giants Russia, China and Japan.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in, who frequently praises mega-popular K-pop boy band BTS, tweeted that he's grateful to Bong for \"giving courage and pride to our people overcoming difficulties.\"\nBut \"Parasite\"'s main characters portray South Koreans who have been left behind by the country's dramatic changes. It's a biting commentary on deepening inequality and other problems that have many young and poor people describing their lives as a hellish nightmare.\nSouth Korea has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor among developed nations and is struggling mightily to deal with decaying job markets, rocketing house prices and a record-low birth rate as couples put off having babies while struggling with low pay and harsh work conditions.\nAlthough fully Korean in language, humour and tone, Bong's dark tale of poverty and class struggle resonates across borders because Western democracies are also experiencing similar social and economic problems, albeit not as \"extreme\" as in South Korea, according to Chin Jung-kwon, a prominent cultural critic.\n\"The film shows that South Korea still has a strong message to show the world,\" Chin said.\nWhile Bong is uniquely talented as a director, it was only a matter of time before South Korean movies and other pop cultural products gained increasing acceptance in the West, considering South Korea's dynamic cultural scene, which has matured along with its democracy, Chin says.\nK-pop has garnered a huge international following with an increasing number of fans coming from the United States.\nWith \"Map of the Soul: Persona,\" BTS last year became the first musicians since the Beatles to debut three consecutive albums atop the Billboard Album chart in a span of less than a year. South Korean TV dramas, which triggered the original \"Korean Wave\" in the early 2000s, continue to be big in Asia and other regions like the Middle East.\nPerhaps more than any other genre, South Korean films have aggressively tested artistic boundaries, often with stunning visuals and violence meant to expose the underside of the country's economic success story.\nThis sometimes creates political consequences for the artists.\nBong was one of thousands of artists who were blacklisted and denied government funds under the rule of conservative former President Park Geun-hye for their allegedly critical views of her administration. Following protests by millions, Park was ousted from office in March 2017 and is now serving a decades-long prison term for corruption.\nNot everyone was happy about how Bong portrayed the characters in \"Parasite,\" which tells the story of how an unemployed family of four living in a slum basement apartment comically con their way into the lives one of Seoul's wealthiest families before things begin to unravel darkly.\nCritic Kim Gyu-hang accused Bong of objectifying poor people and treating their lives like a \"sightseeing attraction,\" saying that the film makes no real attempt at explaining how the system locked the characters in a desperately hopeless situation.\n\"(\"Parasite\") provides no deep insight into humans, their anger and how they are a byproduct of the social system that surrounds them,\" Kim said.\n\"Parasite\"'s Oscars success follows years of struggles by South Korean directors to break through in Hollywood. Park Chan-wook, who won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival with his thriller \"Oldboy,\" received mixed reviews for his 2013 work \"Stoker,\" an English-language thriller starring Nicole Kidman. Bong enjoyed both commercial and critical success with his 2013 sci-fi film \"Snowpiercer,\" which starred Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton along with \"Parasite\" actor Song Kang-ho.\nBut nothing that's come before has been remotely as successful as this South Korean film shot in the Korean language.\n\"Every society in the world experiences conflicts created by people's efforts to move up the class ladder, and South Korean films have dealt with this issue for a long time,\" said veteran filmmaker Lee Jang-ho. \"Maybe Bong's dark humour and his vivid description of the lives of the South Korean poor, including their 'half-basement' living spaces, felt refreshing to American moviegoers.\""}, {"text": "Editor's note: This article is the 4th of seven film reviews that are The Daily staff's top picks from the 92nd Academy Awards\u00a0nominees. The final results will be announced at the annual ceremony, streaming at 7 p.m. Feb. 9 on ABC Network.\u00a0\n\"Parasite\" is a nearly perfect movie which deserves every award it is a contender for, however it does notneed any awards to prove itself.\u00a0\nThe film has already made history by being the first South Korean film to be nominated for the Oscars \"best picture\" category. \"Parasite,\" directed by Bong Joon-ho, was also nominated for five other Academy Awards: \"best director,\"\"best film editing,\" \"best foreign language film,\" \"best original screenplay\" and \"best production design.\"\nIt's so metaphorical.Thank you @TheAcademy #OscarNoms #ParasiteMovie pic.twitter.com/hG67pdZZ2Y - Parasite (@ParasiteMovie) January 13, 2020\nPrior to its Oscar nominations, the film performed well with critics during its festival circuit - even winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.\u00a0\nMost recently, on Jan. 5, the film took home the Screen Actors Guild award for \"outstanding performance by a cast,\" beating out top contenders and big names such as Robert De Niro and \"The Irishman\" ensemble, and Quentin Tarantino's star-studded cast for \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"\nThe film is deserving of every award it has earned. It is one of the most pleasurable movie-going experiences of 2019.\u00a0\nPart-heist, part-horror, part-comedy, part-drama, \"Parasite\" defies genre to deliver a fluid experience of laughter, tears and moments of \"Oh god, what's happening?\"\u00a0\nThe plot follows a lower class family, struggling to make ends meet, who become the caretakers of a rich family in one of South Korea's wealthiest neighborhoods.\nThat is as much plot detail a viewer can learn before venturing into spoiler territory.\u00a0\nThe film is best experienced with little-to-no knowledge of its plot, as it is full of fun and shocking moments, all cleverly interlaced in one of the most compelling plots put on screen. \u00a0\nAmerican audiences would most recognize director Bong's work from \"Snowpiercer\" (Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton) and Netflix's \"Okja\" (Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal), though he has more Korean-language films under his belt, \"Parasite\" among them.\nWhile the cast is made up of entirely Korean actors, they rightfully deserve their SAG award and should have been nominated for the Academy Awards as well. Despite the difference in language, every character in \"Parasite\" is phenomenal because of the actors portraying them.\nSong Kang-ho, who plays the father of the poor family in the film, has been a frequent star in Bong's previous works and gives an incredibly subdued performance, perfectly suited for where the plot takes his character. The children in the main family, portrayed by Choi Woo-sik and Park So-dam, give such believable performances that the audience might forget they aren't really siblings. This review could detail every performance and praise each individual, but it would be more beneficial to just watch the film.\nAmerican audiences are notoriously bad at seeing foreign films in theaters compared to the rest of the world. There are a variety of reasons for the lack of engagement. Subtitles are a large turn-off for movie goers who think its too much of a burden to read an English translation, but Bong has been campaigning for Americans to watch more foreign language films.\n\u00a0\"Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,\"\u00a0\u00a0Bong said in his Golden Globes acceptance speech.\nWhile the Academy Awards are frequently seen by American audiences as the pinnacle of film awards, to foreign filmmakers it's just another awards show. Other awards, like the Palme d'Or at Cannes, are much more coveted. In an interview with Vulture, Bong even called the event \"local\" in terms of relevance.\nWhile the Oscars may not hold much international importance, the awards give notoriety to films and filmmakers, especially with American audiences, that may not otherwise receive it.\n\"Parasite\" is a great place for American audiences to start overcoming their phobia of subtitles, because by the first 15 minutes of the film there will be less focus on \"Why am I reading?\" and more focus on \"What happens next?\"\nFilm enthusiasts should make it their top priority to see \"Parasite\" - best experienced in a theater - as soon as possible. OU's Meacham Auditorium will have 6 p.m., 9 p.m. and midnight showings of the film on Friday, March 6. \u00a0\nThe Academy Awards air at 7 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 9 on ABC network. The awards show will be full of American stars and filmmakers but if previous awards are anything to go by, \"Parasite\" is all set up to make a big splash among its American contenders, and rightfully so.\u00a0\nThe Daily staff's full list of reviews from the 92nd Academy Awards nominations:\n\u2022\t\"1917\"\n\u2022\t\"The Irishman\"\n\u2022\t\"Little Women\""}, {"text": "Bong Joon-ho's film \"Parasite\" starts in a dingy, half-basement apartment with a family of four barely able to scratch out a life. There must be no place to go but up, right? Yes and no. There's nothing predictable when the South Korean director is on his game.\nThis dark, socially conscious film about the intertwining of two families is an intricately plotted, adult thriller. We can go up, for sure, but Bong can also take us deeper down. There's always an extra floor somewhere in this masterpiece.\nIt tells the story of the impoverished four-person Kim family who, one by one, and with careful and devious planning, all get employed by the four-person affluent Park family - as a tutor, an art teacher, a driver and a housekeeper. They are imposters stunned by the way wealth can make things easier: \"Money is an iron. It smooths out all the creases,\" says the Park patriarch with wonder.\nBong, who directed and wrote the story for \"Parasite,\" has picked his title carefully, of course. Naturally, he's alluding to the sycophantic relationship by a clan of scammers to the clueless rich who have unwittingly opened the doors of their home on a hill. But it's not that simple. The rich family seem incapable of doing anything - from dishes to sex - without help. Who's scamming who?\nBong's previous films play with film genres and never hide their social commentary - think of the environmentalist pig-caper \"Okja\" and the dystopian sci-fi global warming scream \"Snowpiercer.\" But this time, Bong's canvas is a thousand times smaller and his focus light-years more intense. There are no CGI train chases on mountains or car chases through cities. (There is also, thankfully, 100% less Tilda Swinton, a frequent, over-the-top Bong collaborator.)\nThe two Korean families first make contact when a friend of the Kim's son asks him to take over English lessons for the Park daughter. Soon the son (a dreamy Choi Woo-sik) convinces them to hire his sister (the excellent Park So-dam) as an art teacher, but doesn't reveal it's his sis. She forges her diploma and spews arty nonsense she learned on the internet, impressing the polite but firm Park matriarch (a superb Jo Yeo-jeong.)\nThe Park's regular chauffer is soon let go and replaced by the Kim patriarch (a steely Lee Sun-kyun). Ditto the housemaid, who is dumped in favour of the Kims' mother (a feisty Jang Hye-jin.) All eight people seem happy with the new arrangement until Bong reveals a twist: There are more parasites than you imagined. The clean, impeccably furnished Park home will have some blood splashing about.\nBong's trademark slapstick is still here but the rough edges of his often too-loud lessons are shaved down nicely and his actors step forward. \"Keep it focused,\" the Kim's son counsels his father at one point. Bong has followed that advice.\nThere are typically dazzling Bong touches throughout. Just look for all the insect references - stink bugs at the beginning to flies at the end, and a preoccupation with odor across the frames. And there's a scene in which the rich matriarch skillfully winds noodles in a bowl while, in another room, duct tape is being wrapped around a victim and classical music plays.\nBong could have been more strident in his social critique but hasn't. There are no villains in \"Parasite\" - and also no heroes. Both families are forever broken after chafing against each other, a bleak message about the classes ever really co-existing (Take that, \"Downton Abbey\").\n\"Parasite\" is a worthy winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first South Korean movie to win the prestigious top prize. The director has called it an \"unstoppably fierce tragicomedy.\" We just call it brilliant.\n\"Parasite,\" a Neon release, is rated R for \"language, some violence and sexual content.\" Running time: 136 minutes. Four stars out of four.\n___\nMPAA definition of R: Restricted.

By the time regular audiences get to see it, that might be more hype[2] than it can bear. Add to that wins at the Sydney Film Festival and Fantastic Fest and Parasite is setting up a tough act to deliver. Fortunately, Parasite is up to the challenge. \nIt's a great movie worthy of those accolades. A family of parasites The Kim family is eeking out a living any way they can. They steal wi-fi in the corners of their home and try to make money folding pizza boxes. This isn't enough so they enact an elaborate plan to install each family member with the Park family.

They're a source of fun and humor, but also danger. Manipulating food allergies is elaborate, but seems little more than deadly than an inconvenience to the victim. Although it also costs her her livelihood, it's not life-threatening.Director Bong Joon-ho[3] ratchets up the tension while maintaining a playful sense of fun. Beyond a certain point in the con I won't spoil where it goes, but everything Bong sets up early in the film pays off in surprising and satisfying ways. The cast sells 'Parasite' Bong and his co-writer Han Jin Won may be the masterminds but Parasite wouldn't work without the charismatic leads enacting their plan. The Kim family actors have a delicate balance to strike. They are manipulators, schemers, thieves and we have to like them. Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment A lot falls on the Park family actors too. Jo is the most reactive to all the cons. She's a germophobe so suspecting the housekeeper is sick sends her into a tizzy. She's also overly protective of her kids so her reactions to all their studies are fraught. She is delicious as we revel in her freaking out but sympathize that we know how badly the Kims are manipulating this poor woman. Who is the real 'Parasite'? So the title Parasite raises interesting connotations. It would be easy to say the Kims are parasites. They're living off the resources of the wealthy. I don't know what the financial climate of Korea is but if it's anything like the U.S. it wouldn't be a stretch to call the Parks parasites. They don't seem to be extremely wealthy but they may have accumulated their comfortable lifestyle by using up people beneath them. Or maybe the Kims are misguided in their targets. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-sik in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment There are more parasites coming between the Kims and the Parks but I won't spoil it. What the ambiguous classification of parasites and the amount of potential parasites suggest is that everybody is using somebody to get ahead. Maybe that's a societal problem that should be examined. There's got to be a way for everybody to mutually benefit from working together.Knowing writer/director Bong Joon-ho's work, it's no spoiler to imply that Parasite turns violent. That's inherent to the con artist genre too. Tricking people often has violent results. That's also the nature of parasitic relationships. Eventually someone is used up. Either the host is bled dry, or the parasite gets removed. So don't be a parasite, but they sure are fun to watch.

There must be no place to go but up, right? Yes and no. There's nothing predictable when the South Korean director is on his game.\nThis dark, socially conscious film about the intertwining of two families is an intricately plotted, adult thriller. We can go up, for sure, but Bong can also take us deeper down. There's always an extra floor somewhere in this masterpiece.\nIt tells the story of the impoverished four-person Kim family who, one by one, and with careful and devious planning, all get employed by the four-person affluent Park family - as a tutor, an art teacher, a driver and a housekeeper. They are imposters stunned by the way wealth can make things easier: \"Money is an iron. It smooths out all the creases,\" says the Park patriarch with wonder.\nBong, who directed and wrote the story for \"Parasite,\" has picked his title carefully, of course. Naturally, he's alluding to the sycophantic relationship by a clan of scammers to the clueless rich who have unwittingly opened the doors of their home on a hill. But it's not that simple. The rich family seem incapable of doing anything - from dishes to sex - without help. Who's scamming who?\nBong's previous films play with film genres and never hide their social commentary - think of the environmentalist pig-caper \"Okja\" and the dystopian sci-fi global warming scream \"Snowpiercer.\" But this time, Bong's canvas is a thousand times smaller and his focus light-years more intense. There are no CGI train chases on mountains or car chases through cities. (There is also, thankfully, 100% less Tilda Swinton, a frequent, over-the-top Bong collaborator.)\nThe two Korean families first make contact when a friend of the Kim's son asks him to take over English lessons for the Park daughter. Soon the son (a dreamy Choi Woo-sik) convinces them to hire his sister (the excellent Park So-dam) as an art teacher, but doesn't reveal it's his sis. She forges her diploma and spews arty nonsense she learned on the internet, impressing the polite but firm Park matriarch (a superb Jo Yeo-jeong.)\nThe Park's regular chauffer is soon let go and replaced by the Kim patriarch (a steely Lee Sun-kyun). Ditto the housemaid, who is dumped in favor of the Kims' mother (a feisty Jang Hye-jin.) All eight people seem happy with the new arrangement until Bong reveals a twist: There are more parasites than you imagined. The clean, impeccably furnished Park home will have some blood splashing about.\nBong's trademark slapstick is still here but the rough edges of his often too-loud lessons are shaved down nicely and his actors step forward. \"Keep it focused,\" the Kim's son counsels his father at one point. Bong has followed that advice.\nThere are typically dazzling Bong touches throughout. Just look for all the insect references - stink bugs at the beginning to flies at the end, and a preoccupation with odor across the frames. And there's a scene in which the rich matriarch skillfully winds noodles in a bowl while, in another room, duct tape is being wrapped around a victim and classical music plays.\nBong could have been more strident in his social critique but hasn't. There are no villains in \"Parasite\" - and also no heroes. Both families are forever broken after chafing against each other, a bleak message about the classes ever really co-existing (Take that, \"Downton Abbey\").\n\"Parasite\" is a worthy winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first South Korean movie to win the prestigious top prize. The director has called it an \"unstoppably fierce tragicomedy.\" We just call it brilliant.\n\"Parasite,\" a Neon release, is rated R for \"language, some violence and sexual content.\" Running time: 136 minutes. Four stars out of four.\n---\nMPAA definition of R: Restricted.

A Korean film called \"Parasite\" opened to record audiences in New York and LA and expands to other cities Friday. Critic Bob Mondello says no matter what audiences expect, they're likely to be surprised.             \nBOB MONDELLO:                 A tale of two families, the Parks, who live in a designer house atop a hill...             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                \nBOB MONDELLO:                 ...And the Kims, who live in a grungy basement apartment across town.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                \nBOB MONDELLO:                 Literally high and low, both physically and in social status, they wouldn't normally meet. But then a friend drops by the Kims' basement with a gift, a big stone that his grandfather claims will bring the family material wealth. This is so metaphorical, says 20-something Kim Ki-woo.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PARASITE\")                \nCHOI WOO-SHIK:                 (As Kim Ki-woo, speaking Korean).             \nBOB MONDELLO:                 His mom is skeptical.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PARASITE\")                \nJANG HYE-JIN:                 (As Kim Chung-sook, speaking Korean).             \nBOB MONDELLO:                 Food would have been better, she says. Still, the friend also brings word that the wealthy Park family needs an English tutor for their daughter, and he sets up Ki-woo with an audition for the job.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                \nBOB MONDELLO:                 Mrs. Park tells him she always sits in on the first lesson.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PARASITE\")                \nCHO YEO-JEONG:                 (As Park Yeon-kyo) If it's OK with you.             \nBOB MONDELLO:                 Ki-woo gets the tutoring job, then starts building on what is a really good deal. The Parks pay well, so he introduces his sister - he says she's a friend of a classmate - as an art therapist for their son. Beats folding pizza boxes to earn money or leaving the window open in the Kim apartment when the city fumigates the alley it's on to get free exterminating.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                \nBOB MONDELLO:                 Money is an iron, says someone. It smooths out the wrinkles - another metaphor, and a clue that the Kim family's scam, which just seems funny at first, is more than it appears. Writer-director Bong Joon-ho never goes for just funny. His sci-fi epic \"Snowpiercer,\" for instance, put the last survivors of a climate disaster on a train and set them to killing each other in a class war. And as the comedy starts curdling in \"Parasite,\" class struggle is again on his mind.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PARASITE\")                \nUNIDENTIFIED ACTOR:                 (As character) I'm deadly serious.             \nBOB MONDELLO:                 The haves here aren't hateful. They're just insensitive. Mr. Park keeps scrunching up his nose and talking about the stench of poverty. And the have-nots aren't vicious, so much as hapless for a while. And then - well, shouldn't spoil things. Let's just say that by \"Parasite's\" conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet.             \n                I'm Bob Mondello.             \n                            (SOUNDBITE OF JENNY LEWIS SONG, \"YOU CAN'T OUTRUN 'EM\")"}, {"text": "Oct 27, 2019( Roger's Movie Nation: http://rogersmovienation.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Korean director who first gained global fame with his wry creature feature 'The Host' reconsiders that host-parasite relationship with his latest, 'Parasite.' Bong Joon Ho has a created a dark satire of haves and enterprising have-nots, a film that begins as a delightful 'Big Con' comedy and probes deeper and turns more politically pointed \u2014 and more violent \u2014 the further it goes along. Most cleverly, this skewering of global inequality and class warfare, at least as it pertains to his home peninsula, leaves unanswered the big question of an era when wealth has been callously and mercilessly redistributed upward to a rapacious few. \nThat question is, 'Who will be first against the wall when the revolution comes?' Bong's muse, the hulking comic Song Kang-ho, plays the unemployed and broke patriarch of a family of four on the bottom rung of Seoul society \u2014 literally. They live in a smelly basement apartment where they've lost cell service, and on the evening we meet them, their free source of wi-fi \u2014 a neighbor \u2014 has just password-protected his router. With his wife,Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) and two enterprising college age kids, Ki-jung (Park So-dam)) and Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), father Ki-taek folds pizza delivery boxes, the lone hustle they have that pays in this economy.And Youtube tutorials or not, they can't even do that right.  How will they cling to this dump, where the toilet sits up on an interior ledge next to the window drunken bums pee on every night? Everybody wonders what Ki-taek's 'plan' is. Dad is big on 'What's your plan?' A windfall that he hasn't planned for is their lifeline, it turns out. Ki-woo's buddy, headed off to study abroad, recommends him as replacement for the rich teen girl he's been tutoring. Sister Ki-jung forges Ki-woo some ace credentials as 'Kevin,' which win over the girl (Jung Ji-so) and her frazzled, pampered mother (Jo Yeo-jeong). And all a 'Parasite' needs, we see, if that first foot in the door. 'Kevin' is quick to recommend 'a friend of a cousin' who studied in Illinois as an art tutor to the ADHD artist child in the house. 'Jessica' is the name Ki-jung goes by. Sizing the kid and his mother's worries up, she improvises 'art therapist' into her resume as well. This scrawled, dark corner in all of little Da-song's drawings? That's 'the schizophrenia zone,' she says, freaking Mom out. That ability to lie on the fly is a family gift, and it's what puts all four of the Kims in the employ of the Parks, by hook or by crook.This 2019 Cannes Palme d'Or winner has fake tutors straight out of Shakespeare ('The Taming of the Shrew'). But I'd be surprised if Bong Joon ho didn't see 2018's Japanese Cannes Film Festival entry 'Shoplifters,' and wasn't inspired to whip up a funnier and more ambitious take on an underworld of low-rent grifters struggling to survive in the Golden Age of Income Inequality. But here, there's sympathy and even a modicum respect for their 'marks.' In an economy where jobs are scarce and survival precarious, the Kims are grateful to have the jobs they finagle (and lie and cheat) their way into. Ki-jung seems to be the most ruthless and cunning one, taking after her pitiless mother. Ki-jung is the one who surmises that the family driver can be unseated, and lets her folks know (in Korean, with English subtitles) 'I set my trap in the Benz,' the family limo, a trap that will get that driver canned. All these amusing machinations are just the table-setting for the confrontations to come. It turns out, the Kims aren't the only ones desperate enough to prey on people like the Parks. And as they hustle them and deal with petty humiliations and bourgeois snobbery, they start to wonder, and make us wonder, just who is the host and who is the real parasite here? Song Kang-ho has an oafish soulfulness that his director has tapped into, in film after film. He can let us feel pity for a character and laugh at him (a little) at the same time. The laughs don't dry up as things take a bloodier turn, but rather devolve into class warfare giggles. We know we should be shrinking from the mayhem, not chuckling. And yet, as in a horror movie where we figure 'They have it coming,' we can't help ourselves. There's something of a Great Leap Forward in Bong Joon Ho's ambitions and skill at realizing them here, something that his failed Netflix satire 'Ojkja' and the over-reaching sci-fi 'Snowpiercer' couldn't manage. With 'Parasite' he transcends genre even as he sharpens his social satire skills, delivering a movie that will resonate from Seoul to Syracuse, Helsinki to Hong Kong, one of the great films of 2019.MPAA Rating: R for language, some violence and sexual content Cast: Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam, Jo Yeo-Jeong, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-sik, Jang Hye-jin, Lee Jeong-eun, JungJi-so Credits: Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho, co-written by Han Jin Won.

But back then, 'making a splash at the Oscars' meant becoming South Korea's first-ever nominee in the Best International Feature Film category (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and maybe, just maybe, slipping into the Best Picture race as a dark horse, the way 2012 Palme winner 'Amour' did. How small and silly those dreams now seem. 'Parasite' has only picked up steam through the summer and fall, going from a longshot to a lock \u2014 and now, eight days before Oscar voting begins and two-and-a-half weeks before the 92nd Academy Awards, it has a real chance to win Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture, along with its guaranteed win in the international category. \nJust last weekend, the film beat 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' and 'The Irishman' to win the SAG ensemble award two days after beating 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'The Irishman' and 'Joker' for the American Cinema Editors' ACE Eddie Award. Given everything that has happened with the film recently, it now feels like the biggest challenger to '1917' for the Best Picture award, with 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' and 'The Irishman' hoping to claw back into the race with a Directors Guild win on Saturday. Also Read: How 'Parasite' Director Bong Joon Ho Created the Year's Most Dangerously Charming Film[1] Here are three reasons why 'Parasite' could win, and one reason why it couldn't.REASONS WHY 'PARASITE' CAN WIN: 1. Because actors love it as long as they don't need to know the difference between Song Kang Ho and Park So Dam.To win the top Oscar, you need the support of the Academy's Actors Branch, which at 1,324 members is by far the largest AMPAS branch. And maybe you could worry about whether the branch loves the film if you simply look at the fact that it didn't receive a single acting nomination from the Academy, or a single individual acting nomination from the Screen Actors Guild. But were the lack of acting nominations really because actors haven't warmed to the movie? Nope. I would suggest it's because most voters have only seen 'Parasite' recently and have no experience with the cast. They simply don't know that it's Song Kang Ho playing the poor family's battered patriarch with enormous dignity and subtlety, or that Park So Dam is perfection as the scheming daughter, or that Cho Yeo Jeong is brilliantly gullible as the rich mother. Should they have figured that out? Of course they should have. But hey, it's a short awards season and Academy screeners can't come with pictures of the cast. And here's the key: In the category where SAG voters didn't need to know individual names, the ensemble category, 'Parasite' not only received a nomination, it won after its actors received a standing ovation for simply walking on stage to introduce a film clip. If actors don't need to get those Korean names straight, they love 'Parasite,' which is full of remarkable acting. Granted, there's a big difference between the 1,200 members of the branch and the 100,000-plus voters in SAG, but it's foolish to think that the film won't have enthusiastic support from the actors in the Academy.

Because it's the ideal consensus candidate.The day after 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' won the Critics' Choice Award and the day it landed 10 Oscar nominations, a story appeared online attempting to link Quentin Tarantino and Brad Pitt to Harvey Weinstein. The day after '1917' won the Producers Guild Award, a trade publication posted a column entitled 'Why '1917' Is the Last Film That Should Be Winning the Oscar.' And the day after 'Parasite' won the SAG ensemble award well, pretty much everybody talked about how cool it was that 'Parasite' won the SAG ensemble award. 'Parasite' is a movie in search of a takedown campaign \u2014 and while the ''Parasite' isn't all that good' take may arrive sooner or later to confirm that it's a true contender, a negative whisper campaign isn't likely to get much traction. It's a movie that almost everybody likes, that almost nobody is sorry to see succeed. And far more than divisive movies like 'Joker' or 'Jojo Rabbit,' it's a movie that may well end up ranked in the Top 5 even on ballots where it's not No. 1. The ranked-choice voting system used by the Academy in the Best Picture category is designed to ferret out a true consensus choice. And 'Parasite' could be that choice. Also Read: '1917' Named Top Film at Producers Guild Awards[3]3. Because the Academy is getting more and more international each year.Last June, 842 people were invited to join the Academy. Of those, around 300 were from outside the United States, including film professionals from 59 different countries. AMPAS is growing at a remarkable rate, with more than 25% of its 8,469 voting members joining in the last four years \u2014 and along with a drive to bring in more women and people of color, the membership drive has focused on reaching outside the United States. That's not to say that non-American voters automatically cast their ballots for non-American films \u2014 but as the international contingent has grown, so has the number of nominations for international films. These are voters who can say, as Best Director winner Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n did last year, 'I grew up watching foreign language films' like 'Citizen Kane,' 'Jaws' and 'The Godfather.' And these are voters who now have a real chance to champion international cinema in an unprecedented way. Also Read: Oscars Academy Set to Surpass Gender and Diversity Membership Goals by Next Year[4] Bong Joon Ho wins the Palme d'Or at Cannes in May REASON WHY 'PARASITE' CAN'T WIN: 1. Because it's a guaranteed winner in what is essentially another 'Best Picture' category.The biggest reason a film not in English will have trouble winning Best Picture isn't that the Academy is averse to non-English films \u2014 it's that they already have a place to reward those films. In the same way that the existence of the Best Animated Feature category and the Best Documentary Feature category help explain why those films rarely (in the case of animation) and never (in the case of docs) show up in the Best Picture race, Best International Feature Film is an irresistible escape hatch for many voters. They might love 'Parasite' \u2014 maybe even enough to vote for Bong for Best Director \u2014 but they can express that love in the international category and have a vote left over for Best Picture. Last year, that thinking no doubt hurt Cuar\u00f3n's 'Roma,' the non-English film with the best chance to win that award. And this year, it will unquestionably hurt 'Parasite' \u2014 quite possibly enough to keep it off the stage at the end of the night. (Maybe 'Parasite' should launch a new ad campaign aimed at Oscar voters: 'You know we're the real Best Picture, so vote for something else in the international category!') I don't know if the three reasons 'Parasite' can win will outweigh the one reason it can't. But I know that in a crazy year, it has a real chance.

The plot of his brilliant satirical thriller Parasite might resemble a bucket of angry snakes - but it's no twistier than the story of the film itself, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes before becoming a \u00a3120million global box office smash, and is now a two-time Bafta winner and six-time Oscar nominee.\nFilms that tickle all three of these groups - Cannes juries, mainstream audiences and Oscar voters - are almost unheard of: the last to do so was Pulp Fiction, 25 years ago. That film's director, Quentin Tarantino, was notably beaten by Bong at the Baftas last Sunday evening in the Best Original Screenplay category: a rare and deserved win for a non-English script.\n\"Sometimes I wonder if Parasite's success is down to the way the film smells,\" he deadpans in his native Korean, laughing as his regular interpreter, Sharon Choi, unflappably relays the thought. (Choi, a 25-year-old Korean-American, has become the breakout star of the Parasite tour for her seemingly effortless live translation on stage and television.) \"Its substance smells pungent and cruel. But in terms of style, it is sweet and enticing.\nPerhaps this is a very unusual and appealing bouquet.\"\nIt's the morning after the Baftas, in the drawing room of Bong's London hotel: a pot of tea (English) is brewing, and modest elevenses have been served. Dressed in a charcoal suit and cardigan, his hair a half-coiffed nest, he's supremely affable, and looks at least a decade younger than his 50 years. The subdued nature of last night's celebrations may be a factor. Once the ceremony was over, he and the Parasite deputation merely shared a quiet drink, and steeled themselves for Oscar week itself.\n\"This is the last hundred metres of a long marathon for the whole team,\" he says. \"And I think the Baftas have given us the adrenalin to finish.\" The biggest surprise of the night, he continues, was how solid the trophies turned out to be. \"A heavy golden mask and an even heavier square stone base,\" he explains, before solemnly adding: \"As weighty as the honour itself.\" There is another quiet chuckle as Choi relays this.\nReleased in the UK this weekend, Parasite is the breakthrough seasoned Bong-watchers have been anticipating for more than a decade, since his metaphorically charged monster movie The Host became an international cult hit. His seventh feature is a tale of two families: the down-at-heel but wily Kims and the affluent but gullible Parks, who live initially very different existences on opposite sides of modern-day Seoul.\nPosing as domestic help, the Kims inveigle their way one by one into the Parks' modernist dream home and horn in on their elegant lifestyle - though once entrenched, a series of unexpected crises throws the ploy into disarray. Many critics, including this one, have found the film hard to categorise.\nThe first half, in which the Kims execute their plan, is like a particularly fiendish heist movie - while the second, in which all kinds of worst-case-scenarios uproariously click into place, is a kind of Rubik's cube farce. And the whole enterprise is struck through with a rich seam of social commentary: the plot turns on the grim divisions, and even grimmer pacts, between rich and poor, which only serve to keep us all in our place.\nThe film's tonal chicanery harks back to Hitchcock, but it has also proven to be an asset in the very modern world of social media, where shots and clips of Parasite's more offbeat moments quickly became enshrined as memes.\nThese were shared far and wide by admirers who proudly assembled under the hashtag #Bonghive - a play on Beyhive, Beyonc\u00e9's online fandom, who have been known to swarm on unbelievers.\nBong and his cast have often found themselves wondering why this particular film - so specifically anchored in modern Korean culture, with its wry asides about propaganda piped in from the north and bougie local food trends - was striking such a chord worldwide. But it became clear that it was doing so last autumn, after its North American premieres at the Telluride, Toronto and New York film festivals, when, says Bong, \"people around me kept telling me the film would be included in Oscar season, whether I liked it or not.\"\nPerhaps it's partly because Korea is uniquely well-equipped to tell a story about division. The country itself has been riven for more than 70 years, after post-Second World War negotiations between the US-occupied south and Soviet-occupied north reached a stalemate.\nThe suave Park family patriarch, played by Lee Sun-kyun, often talks about not crossing lines: \"And while he's referring to the lines between classes and generations, every Korean person also lives with the line of the 38th parallel in the back of their mind.\" Bong was born in the city of Daegu in 1969 and raised in Seoul under the dictatorial Fourth Republic. His father was a professor in graphic design, his mother the daughter of the respected novelist Park Tae-won, who scandalously defected to the North in 1950.\nAs a student, Bong was a member of the country's prodemocracy movement: he also tutored the son of a very rich family friend, an experience that planted the seeds for Parasite in his mind. He discovered cinema through the US armed forces' television channel, his eye caught by the obvious censors' cuts and his imagination fired by thoughts of what they might conceal.\nNow long-settled with his wife of 24 years, Sun-young - the couple have a son, Hyo-min, and a pet Norwich terrier, Zzuni - he politely rejects the idea that Parasite is an angry-young-manstyle \"message movie\". \"I don't have the ability to use a film to reflect a specific political agenda,\" he says - though stresses its timely resonance is fully meant.\n\"Of the many divisions that exist within this film, the most horrific and cruel and blackly comic is the one between the various poor characters,\" he says. \"Because unfortunately, they don't help each other. They can't form the sense of solidarity. And while that causes a lot of pain and sadness for the audience, I also think that's the most honest portrayal of what's going on in the world right now.\"\nB ong's rise coincided with the explosion in the early 2000s of a gutsy, stylish new Korean cinema, heralded in the UK by the 2004 release of Park Chan-wook's taboo-smashing Oldboy. He gives a very earnest-sounding account of the movement's genesis, which Choi goes on to translate as the Korean government spiking the water supply in the late Nineties with an experimental chemical. Chortling, he then says it was actually the result of a sudden relaxation in censorship, \"the fall of social repression we'd been living with until then\".\nNevertheless, his work landed him on a \"leaked\" government blacklist of politically dangerous figures in the art world, to be denied state subsidies and possibly surveilled. His 2003 serial killer procedural Memories of Murder was flagged for its portrayal of \"government officials and police as corrupt and/or incompetent groups, instilling negative perceptions in the public\", while 2013's Snowpiercer, a muscular INVISION/AP HOLDEN/ science-fiction allegory set on board a post-apocalyptic express train, was decried for \"[repudiating] the market economy and [encouraging] campaigns of social resistance\".\nVON MARK Bong roars with laughter. \"It was so f------ stupid,\" he says, momentarily dropping into English, and recalls a discussion with Park Chan-wook, who was likewise named and shamed. \"There were so many filmmakers on that list. We were like, 'Are there that many directors in Korea?' And everyone who wasn't included felt kind of insulted. 'This is a misunderstanding! I have to be on that list!' It was like something from a black comedy.\"\nOf course, it was also borderline dystopian, and after the impeachment of Korean president2017, her former was found guilty sentenced to two Bong, meanwhile, two more projects Seoul-set disaster elements of action London-based by what he describes as \"a British story from 2016\".\nBong take on Brexit referendum, or Hatton Garden heist?

The Kim family comprising dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang), daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) live hand to mouth in their basement home in a slum.\nUsing false pretences, Ki-woo begins to tutor small Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso), the pubescent daughter of wealthy Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), and his naive wife Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong). Soon enough, Ki-jung gets hired as an art therapist for the Park's youngest son, Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun).\nA couple of cunningly-plotted schemes result in the Park's chauffeur and loyal housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) who harbours a secret, replaced by Ki-taek and Chung-sook. Just as this family of cons gets comfortable (and complacent) there is a radical shift in their fortunes.\nBong's film illuminates the lack of fellowship and empathy on both sides of the class divide. His sympathy and compassion for the poor is palpable but he is very clear about their flaws. The poor are not innocent, if anything, they are wolves in sheep's clothing, having absolutely no compunctions in ripping off their rich selfish employers. Collaborating on the thoughtful script with Jin-won, director Bong casts a non-judgemental spotlight on an existential battle between the poverty stricken and the callous wealthy.\nThe Parasite's Palme d'Or at Cannes for Best Picture is well deserved and yes, it ought to win at the Golden Globes and the Oscars as well."}, {"text": "Oscar-winning South Korean movie Parasite, which created history by winning four Academy Awards this year, will start streaming on Amazon Prime Video from March 27. The movie will also be available in Hindi.\nHelmed and written by Bong Joon Ho, Parasite deals with class divide and how one underprivileged family cons and somewhat manages to climb up the social ladder before things fall apart. It features Park So-dam, Choi Woo-shik and Kang-Ho Song among others.\nApart from the Hindi dubbing, Parasite will also be available on Amazon Prime Video with English subtitles.\nIn her review of Parasite, The Indian Express film critic Shalini Langer wrote, \"Bong Joon-Ho, who has also co-written the story, has several surprises and twists up his sleeve. And many metaphors. About parasite, host. Upstairs, downstairs. Loyalty, love. Virtue, vice. Gutter, smell. Casual affluence, deliberate offence. Rain/sun for some, floods/heat for the other. And about the wool we pull over our eyes as we turn the other way, telling ourselves some lies to help us do that.\"\nShe added, \"Ho strips that wool off, thread by thread. Right down to the only truth there is - not education, not degree, not work, but money.\""}, {"text": "A laugh turns into a snarl which gets stuck in the throat like a sob - or an arrow through the neck - in Bong Joon-ho's latest wild, wild ride, \"      \u00a0    Parasite.\" On paper, that might not sound so very different from the experience of watching Bong's \"Snowpiercer,\" \"Memories of Murder\" \"The Host\" or \"Okja.\" The Korean trickster god is above all known for his uncategorizable movie mel\u00e9es which tumble bloodily down the genre stairs hitting every step - comedy, horror, drama, social commentary, slasher, creature feature, murder mystery, manifesto for vegetarianism - on the way. But while \"      \u00a0    Parasite\" certainly cycles through more than half that list, the laugh is darker, the snarl more vicious and the sob more despairing than we've ever had from him before. Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: \"Parasite\" is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage.\nIt doesn't start off that way. With typical feint-and-parry dexterity, the film begins as a so-close-it's-almost-self-conscious Korean reworking of last year's Palme d'Or winner \"Shoplifters.\" Here too we have a ramshackle but loving family driven to dubious extremes by poverty-stricken circumstance, and a rumpled patriarch (Song Kang-ho) who bursts amusingly with pride at even the most marginal of his kids' achievements. \"Does Oxford have a course in forgery?\" he asks admiringly, looking at the fake qualification his daughter Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) has comped together for her brother Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik).\nFrom their squalid \"semi-basement\" (a couple of dank rooms with a small strip of window against which drunken men are given to urinating) all four members of this family, including their ex-champion shot-putter mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) struggle to find menial gig-economy jobs and an unlocked wifi signal. But then Ki-woo is offered the chance to replace a friend as the tutor for Da-hye (Jung Ziso), daughter of the wealthy Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun).\nSuddenly Ki-woo's days of folding pizza boxes for peanuts are behind him, and instead he gets to hang out with his lovestruck student and her daintily pretty, naive mother Yeon-kyo (Cho Yo-Jeong) in the Parks' spacious architect-designed home. When it turns out Da-hye's hyperactive, \"Indian\"-obsessed little brother Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) needs an art tutor, Ki-woo spots another opportunity and recommends his sister - in disguise as college acquaintance \"Jessica.\" And so one more cuckoo settles into this luxuriously appointed nest.\nAlthough this is the least loopy title from Bong in a while - there's no room for a cartoonishly broad, heavily dentured Tilda Swinton performance, for example - the first act bounces by with a devil-may-care gait as the scam expands, things start to look up for the family and while they've been roguish, no one has done anything so very unforgivable yet. But even with proceedings at their jauntiest, the sincere classical score from Jung Jae-il and the restraint of the cinematography by Hong Kyung-po (who also shot last year's Korean masterpiece, \"Burning\") give \"Parasite\" a sheen of brushed-steel seriousness.\nThis is the most formally polished work we've seen from Bong: As opposed to the herky-jerk genre-hopping of \"The Host,\" here the story elides so seamlessly from one mood to the next that the joins are near-impossible to find, like those of the poured-concrete walls of the Parks' modernist dream home. Production designer Lee Ha-jun's conception of the two contrasting residences, one a grotty subterranean hovel, the other a clean-lined work of livable art on a gated suburban hillock fringed to perfect privacy with dense trees and shrubs, is a masterful example of evoking class difference through space and light. Those are commodities that apparently only the rich deserve.\nIt would have been easy for Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won to have made the privileged Parks overtly detestable, but time and again it is asserted just how nice they are. \"If I was rich,\" sighs Chung-sook drunkenly, \"I would be nice too. Money is an iron; it smoothes out all the wrinkles.\" And certainly, Mr. and Mrs. Park live a largely uncreased life, save for the slightest wrinkling of the nose when an unpleasant odor - perhaps the tang of poverty itself - assails them. But for every gut-punch moment of blithe, enraging entitlement on their part, there's an equally horrible instance of selfishness or spite from their less moneyed counterparts: It takes a watchmaker's skill to keep the pendulum of our sympathies swinging back and forth between the grasping desperation of the poor and the idle hatefulness of the rich.\nTiny details, like the mention of a Taiwanese cake shop or the flickering of a hall lamp, all pay off in this most tightly plotted of Bong's films, building to a conclusion that is devastating and yet satisfying as an accretion of a thousand of those little moments. So as plans go awry, quasi-Gothic revelations occur and things get pretty grisly, we've been so wholly worked into Bong's cleverly concealed sympathies that we might shock ourselves by feeling a sense of cathartic rightness at a moment of clearly wrongheaded violence.\nThe catharsis does not last long, though. As ferocious as this brilliant, caustic film is, with its flawless craft and humor - so dark it's like it, too, was bred in a basement and never saw the sun - it also rumbles constantly with a bleak growl at just how little all this high drama can actually ever matter, an impression reinforced by Hong's dispassionate, almost sardonically pristine camera. Even this grand battle royale between the haves and have-nots will only ever be a squabble at the feet of an indifferent god, or worse still, a sideshow indulged to distract its participants from the real enemy, which is a system that creates and nourishes such divides in the first place. This is the sad little truth evoked in the film's unexpectedly moving final moments: Eat the rich, by all means, fill your bellies, but pretty soon you'll be hungry again, and you will still be poor.\nRelated stories\nBong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' Earns Five-Minute Cannes Ovation\nCannes: Central Partnership Inks Multiple Deals on 'Billion' (EXCLUSIVE)"}, {"text": "Bong Joon-ho's \"Parasite\" had been hailed as one of the best films of the year even before it hit theaters in the United States. The film contains elements from a wide variety of genres, especially thrillers and black comedies. Bong's previous directorial endeavors like \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja\" have found success in the United States, and it looks like \"Parasite\" will be just as lucrative.\u00a0\n\"Parasite\" is a South Korean thriller about an unemployed lower-class family who manages to find employment in the home of a wealthy family. The film premiered at Cannes, where it won the prestigious Palme d'Or. Some moviegoers may be turned off by the fact that the film is in Korean, but missing out on one of the most unique and genuinely enjoyable films of the year would be extremely regrettable.\u00a0\nThe audience is introduced to the lower-class Kim family (played by Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin, Choi Woo-Shik, and Park So-dam) in the opening scenes of the film and it is clear they are not well off financially. The high-class Park family (played by Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Jung Ji-so, and Jung Hyun-joon) has a sleek, beautiful home to house their perfect children. One by one the Kims associate themselves with the Parks, attempting to rid the existing servants there.\nThe story is presented as a tactful plot to infiltrate the Park household by convincing the parents to hire the Kims individually without the Parks knowing they are all related. The story progresses through the twists and turns of their act, and is an easy contender for Best Original Screenplay. \"Parasite\" also shares some similarities with Jordan Peele's latest film \"Us\" which came out earlier this year. Both films deal with issues like social class in an artistic, eye-opening way. \"Parasite\" also hints at its self-awareness as a film riddled with commentary on privilege, adding to the film's perfect amount of humor.\nBong has crafted a couple of other well-known movies such as \"The Host\" and \"Snowpiercer,\" both of which some of the highest-grossing South Korean movies of all time. His previous movie \"Okja\" also competed at Cannes, and Bong has established himself as one of the best filmmakers of the twenty-first century.\n\"Parasite\" is an exciting, beautiful film that raises questions about class relationships and just what lengths a family can go to save each other. Bong Joon-ho tells an enticing narrative that takes the typical family struggle story to new heights."}, {"text": "Jan 20, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite just made history again[1].

A team of experts from the World Health Organization heads to the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak. We have a live reporter.\nM. HOLMES: And days overdue, the final results of the Iowa caucuses are in as the 2020 Democratic contenders prepared to face off in New Hampshire.\nAnd we begin with the Oscars. For the first time in the history of the academy awards, a non-English language film taking home the top prize of best picture.\nALLEN: It was the wow moment, sure enough. The film and its director, Bong Joon-ho, were also honored for best director, best international feature film and best screenplay. Talk about sweet. The wind is sure to create a lot of incitement in the picture's home country, South Korea. So we want to start right there.\nLet's turn to CNN's Paula Hancocks joining us from Pyeongchang. And so many times when we come to you, Paul, it's about North Korea or something dangerous, but now, this is celebration time for South Korea. That's nice.\nPAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Natalie. I mean, this will go down extremely well here in South Korea. Bong Joon-ho, the director, is very well known here. He is very well respected, and Koreans love his films. But now, they know that the rest of the world loves his films as well, so four Oscars for this particular film. There were six nominations in all, but, of course, it is that best picture, the best film, which is completely key to the success of this film. The fact that it's the first time that it is foreign language, a non-English language film that has taken this accolade.\nAnd we did hear from Bong Joon-ho, the director, as he accepted the award, and he thanked Martin Scorsese. He gave respect to Martin Scorsese, another director, saying that he had inspired him when he was young. He also thanked Quentin Tarantino.\nNow, it's interesting, because when we did catch up with him with CNN on the red carpet, just a week ago, at the BAFTAs. He was asked, who do you want to meet with? And he said, Martin Scorsese, and giggled, showing that this is all new to him, that he was loving the fact that he was at these wonderful awards. But it was a new sensation. And now, he is standing up there in front of all of his peers, in front of the world, and thanking those who he believes actually inspired him.\nNow, this film, Parasite, it's a remarkable film. It has grossed $160 million worldwide. That really puts it in the realm of the Hollywood blockbusters, and yet it is a Korean film. It's a film about the class war around the world. It's based in South Korea but it's a poor family who inserts itself into a rich family's household, into their lives with devastating effects. I'm not going to give any more of the plot away from that, because if you have not seen it, you should see it. And it is remarkable that this has made history tonight.\nALLEN: Yes. And it was also kind of really cool as they stood on stage, having to have a translator for the audience there at the Oscars. I don't know when I have seen that.\nSo, now, the world knows Bong Joon-ho. He is adorable from his many times at the microphone, but how well-known is he in South Korea?\nHANCOCKS: He's very well known here in South Korea. He is a household name. He has done many films. This is by no means his first hit. He has had a number of hits here in South Korea and has been done this for some time.\nAnd now I spoke to a director who's also a friend of Bong Joon-ho and asked him about this. And he said, this was before the Oscars, obviously, but it was after he won the Palme d'Or. It was after the BAFTAs, the SAG Awards, winning many accolades around the world. And he said he felt like he was in a dream.\nAnd he also said that it was like the Korean people as a whole felt this was like a dream. They know him and they know that he is a wonderful director and his films to do well. But now, the rest of the world knows it as well.\nSo for many Koreans who know about this, I was just at lunch here with some Koreans when we heard the news. I told them the news, and there was applause.\n[00:05:03]\nThey were absolutely delighted that Bong Joon-ho has had this international recognition, Nat.\nALLEN: Yes, absolutely. And an ensemble cast. You could tell they were all just shocked and absolutely thrilled when they took the stage.\nAll right, really cool, Paula Hancocks for us in South Korea. Thanks, Paula.\nAll right, we get back to other news now. We turn to China, where officials are trying to contain the Wuhan coronavirus, are about to get some more help.\nM. HOLMES: That's right. The World Health Organization says a team of experts has been sent to the country to investigate the outbreak. Now, this coming as the number of deaths and infections continues to climb. The global death toll from the virus has now passed 900, all but two of those cases coming from mainland China.\nALLEN: The disease has now killed 871 people in Hubei Province alone. That's the epicenter of the outbreak. Meantime, the number of infections worldwide now exceeds 40,000, again, with the vast majority in China.\nMeantime, in Wuhan, another person who spoke about virus appears to have disappeared. Steven Jiang is our reporter live in Beijing for us.\nSteven, you've been covering this since the start. We, of course, know, about the doctor who first recognized the virus who ended up dying. And now, we have something else that's curious. What can you tell us?\nSTEVEN JIANG, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: That's right, Natalie. The disappearing citizen journalist reminded a lot of people of the doctor you mentioned, Dr. Li Wenliang, who, of course, passed away on Friday, after he contracted this very virus he was trying to warn others about back in December.\nNow, this citizen journalist, Chen Qiushi, he shared something in common with the doctor. They were both 34 years old from the northeastern part of this country. But Mr. Chen had been roaming around in Wuhan for some two weeks before he disappeared last Thursday. Now, his friends and family are telling us he was taken away by local police and placed under forced quarantine ostensibly for his own health.\nBut friends are saying they are now worried about his safety because the authorities obviously view him as a troublemaker. During his time in Wuhan, Mr. Chen took his camera to the hospitals, to the streets of Wuhan in the epicenter and he really captured a grim picture sometimes in stark contrast to what the state media was trying to present to the audience here.\nMr. Chen filmed the desperation of people trying to seek medical help but to no avail. He filmed the helplessness of many who said they have lost loved ones, seeing loved ones dying in front of their eyes, and also he filmed the overwhelming situation there, both in the hospitals there and even in the morgue. Natalie?\nALLEN: Yes. And, Steven, what does his disappearance mean to the people of China who have really been speaking against Beijing after the death of the doctor and calling for openness and free speech since this? What do you think this will do for the citizens who've had enough of this?\nJIANG: That's really interesting. Because, obviously, this citizen journalist, Mr. Chen's social media account had long been closed here in China, but he managed to host his videos on YouTube and attracting millions of views and with huge attention, including from within China. People imagine the scale of this so-called firewall to actually try and to find out what he found out on the ground in Wuhan.\nNow, the silencing of him, of course, reminded a lot of them the silencing of the doctor. And this also, of course, happening at a time when the authorities here are trying to ramp up their propaganda, trying to increasingly shape news coverage and online conversations about this outbreak. They are now, it seems to be, not only trying to control the flow of people as they try to contain the virus, but also increasingly the flow of information. Natalie?\nALLEN: And that can't help to save lives, really. It's just very a shame. All right. Steven Jiang for us, thank you so much.\nNow, Michael?\nM. HOLMES: All right. Thanks, Natalie.\nDr. Carlos Del Rio is a professor of Global Health and Medicine at Emory University. He joins us now live from Colorado. You have talked to us before on this, and let's continue the conversation.\nIt was interesting and a bit concerning that within a month or so, coronavirus overtook the death toll of SARS, which made its death toll in eight months. I mean, what do you make of the spread and importantly, the mortality of this virus so far?\nDR. CARLOS DEL RIO, PROFESSOR, MEDICINE AND GLOBAL HEALTH, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Good evening, Michael. Well, there are two issues. Number one, this virus is a lot more transmissible, more contagious than SARS or MERS is.\n[00:10:06]\nSo the transmission resembles more influenza, and the mortality resembles more influenza, so I like to think of this virus more as an influence-like virus. This is a very severe -- this virus is spreading very rapidly into a lot of people.\nBut the mortality, if you think of the number of people infected, I think there's about 40,000 recorded cases, but there might might be two or three times of that in reality, so let's say just 120,000 cases. 800 deaths, maybe the deaths are underreported, so maybe double that. But still maybe 2 percent of the deaths and --2 percent of the patients are dying. So the mortality is a lot lower than we've seen in prior coronaviruses. And so --\nM. HOLMES: A very relevant point.\nI wanted to ask you too about a medical reporter that I know you are aware of. It found more than 40 percent of patients diagnosed at one hospital in Wuhan, in China, were presumed to have been infected in that hospital, and only patients that were sick were tested. So it could have been even more transmission than that. What did we learn about that, about preventing the transmission in the future?\nDEL RIO: Well, we've seen this with other coronaviruses, with SARS and with MERS. We've seen what we physicians call nosocomial transmission, which is transmission in hospitals, not only to other patients, but to healthcare workers. And we've also seen this, for example, Ebola transmission to other healthcare workers.\nSo what we learn is that with all of these (ph) infections, we have to take special precautions in hospitals. We have to make sure we isolate potential cases, we do the appropriate and we have decisions on health. We have healthcare personnel who use what we call personal protective equipment used appropriately to prevent us from getting infected.\nSo one of the things that hospitals are doing right now is refreshing the training on how to put on and put off what we call don on and don off the personal protective equipment so we can actually be prepared in case of (INAUDIBLE) like this.\nM. HOLMES: Yes. One other thing that -- and we touched on last time we spoke, and I think it's perhaps even more important now. The risk if this gets to a more secretive country, one without the resources to deal with it or the honesty to acknowledge a problem in the first place. I mean, There have been reports, we don't know if they are true, but in the South Korean media of cases in North Korea. A major parade was canceled this weekend. What are the risks if it does happen in a country like that, which probably would just want to hide it?\nDEL RIO: Well, North Korean, I'm not too concerned, because there's not a lot of communication to the outside world, so it will stay there. But I think it is a concern, quite frankly, as, for example, cases in Africa. There's a huge growth in the past decade (INAUDIBLE). Many airlines have cut flights but a few (ph) airlines continues flying. So there're (INAUDIBLE) at Bali International Airport screening passengers that are coming from China.\nBut my biggest concern is that if this virus gets to a place China, like India or Africa, for example, because they are going to spread (INAUDIBLE) a lot more serious than we've currently seen.\nM. HOLMES: Yes, a very, very good point. Dr. Carlos Del Rio, thank you so much, I apreciate your expertise on this. Thank you.\nDEL RIO: Thank you, Michael, and have a good evening. ALLEN: Coming up here, it was touch and go at London's Heathrow airport as high winds made mess of air travel across Northern Europe and wait until we show you some of the landings.\nM. HOLMES: We will be right back.\n[00:15:00]\nALLEN: All right. Well, it took a while but after days of waiting and confusion, the Iowa Democratic Party says U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has won the most delegates in the Iowa caucuses.\nM. HOLMES: It feels like it was a year ago, doesn't it?\nALLEN: I know.\nM. HOLMES: Yes. The updated numbers show the former South Bend, Indiana mayor with a very slim lead over Bernie Sanders, who won the popular vote and that's annoying his supporters. The Sanders campaign, in fact, says it's going to ask for a partial re-canvass of the results on Monday.\nNow, after the Democratic debacle in Iowa, and it was that, voters in New Hampshire are going to go to the polls on Tuesday. It's not a caucus, it is the first in the nation primary.\nALLEN: Democratic hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are looking to make up ground after coming in third and fourth respectively in Iowa.\nFor more, Jeff Zeleny is on the campaign trail.\nJEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: And with a little more than one day left before the New Hampshire primary voting begins, Bernie Sanders is feeling confident, and this is one of the reasons why.\nOur latest poll shows that he is seven percentage points up over his nearest rival, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. But Elizabeth Warren, one of his key competitors for so many months here in New Hampshire, is even trailing farther than that. Joe Biden, of course, also making his way, Amy Klobuchar is below him.\nSo the question here in the final hours of this campaign, could this dynamic change? The New Hampshire primary has a history of delivering surprises so it certainly could. And there is somewhat of a circular firing squad going on here. We have seen Joe Biden aggressively taking on Pete Buttigieg. We've seen Pete Buttigieg, of course, defending himself all over experience. but we're also hearing from Bernie Sanders. Question for the first time, by name, Pete Buttigieg in how he is raising money.\nThroughout the duration of his campaign for the last year or more and certainly throughout the Iowa campaign, Bernie Sanders didn't mention of his rivals by name. He did not criticize Pete Buttigieg. He did that as he is campaigning in New Hampshire, pointing out that he is raising money in his words from billionaires. Of course, nothing illegal about that, but Bernie Sanders raises his money just bit by bit over the internet and online contributions, small dollar donations raising it for the long haul.\nSo the question here is will voters side with Bernie Sanders, certainly, the most progressive candidate in this race or will the independent voters of New Hampshire so critical here, representing about a third of the voters. Well, they think that Bernie Sanders is simply too liberal.\n[00:20:04]\nThose are some of the closing dynamics here we are watching.\nSo Senator Sanders is a clear favorite. He won the state by 21 percentage points four years ago. He's from neighboring Vermont, so all signs would indicate a strong night for him. But, again, New Hampshire can deliver surprises and can the humble frontrunners as well. So in the final hours of this campaigning here, we'll see if this circular firing squad hits anyone or if Senator Sanders goes on to win it. If he does, it certainly puts him in a strong position for the remainder of the contest coming up this month.\nALLEN: Well, not to be outdone, U.S. President Trump is also headed to New Hampshire to fire up his supporters.\nM. HOLMES: CNN's Kristen Holmes with that side of the story.\nKRISTEN HOLMES, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: If Monday night's rally in New Hampshire looks anything like this weekend, President Trump will be in full attack mode. On Sunday, he spent the day on Twitter lashing out at Democrats for everything, from impeachment to the Iowa caucus. He also hit those senators who voted against him in impeachment.\nI want to read one of these tweets in particular. He says, they are really mad at Senator Joe Munchkin, he means Joe Manchin, in West Virginia. He couldn't understand the transcripts. Romney could but didn't want to. He also lashed at a Democratic Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, saying, he was looking forward to beating him in this election.\nIt should be noted that these messages are really intended for his base. They are intended to rile up his supporters, which they will do. And back in 2016, President Trump shocked the political establishment winning the New Hampshire primary using this kind of rhetoric.\nBut as we head into his re-election, it is a bit of a different scenario this time around. His own campaign advisers have acknowledged that in order to win in 2020, President Trump will have to court some of those moderate voters. So as he picks up on the campaign trail, that is one thing that we are watching very closely. How will he marry his tweets and his rhetoric at these rallies with the courting of the moderate voter or will he at all? Will there be any change as he begins really ramping up this campaign season?\nKristen Holmes, CNN, the White House.\nM. HOLMES: Now to Ireland, where Sinn Fein has won the most seats so far in the first count of votes in the general election. That count is still underway. It might even take weeks before a coalition could be formed.\nALLEN: The current prime minister says he is unwilling to govern with Sinn Fein, the party once associated with the Irish Republican Army. He calls the idea a forced marriage.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nLEO VARADKAR, IRISH PRIME MINISTER: In order to form a government together, we have to have the same -- roughly the same views around the courts and the criminal justice system, around how the economy should be built (ph) and also how to (INAUDIBLE). And that's what makes my party not compatible with Sinn Fein. We are willing to talk to other parties about how we could form a government.\nMARY LOU MCDONALD, PRESIDENT, SINN FEIN PARTY: It's a big statement of change. It is a big statement that this is no longer a two-party system. It's a statement that people want at different type governments, and that people have great confidence and I say that with all humility.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nALLEN: So an exit poll suggested an unprecedented three-way tie between the main parties.\nWell, the storm named Ciara has slammed Northern Europe with heavy rains and high winds in early Sunday, the weather forced a dramatic event in London. We'll show you.\nM. HOLMES: Yes, no harm done. But have a look at this, a passenger jet struggling to land at Heathrow because of those cross winds there. Does the old touch and go, it touches down and then the landing gets aborted and the pilot takes off again and does what they call a go- around. And the plane did land safely on the second try. t would've been a bit nerve-wrecking for everyone on board.\nALLEN: White-knuckling.\nM. HOLMES: Absolutely, white-knuckle flying out.\nOur aviation expert, Richard Quest, says pilots are trained in these touch and goes, but it's very unusual, he said, for such a large passenger jet to do it.\nALLEN: But the pilot did it.\nM. HOLMES: Yes, they're good at it. Yes.\nALLEN: Yes, they are. Thank goodness. And while that jet struggled with the strong winds, another got quite boost. A New York to London flight broke the record for subsonic air travel due to the powerful tail winds across the Atlantic.\nM. HOLMES: Yes. It landed almost two hours ahead of schedule, pretty pleasing unless you had someone driving up to the airport to meet you, Karen Maginnis.\nKAREN MAGINNIS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Exactly. Yes. And the wind is just one aspect of what we've seen with this system and, yes, want to be on an aircraft where you know you are crabbing into the landing is very unnerving. It's happened to me one time. And, yes, for such a large aircraft to have to go around again is also unnerving.\nBut the wind, as I mentioned, is just one aspect.\n[00:25:01]\nThere was flooding rain, there was reduced visibility. It impacted almost every aspect of life across United Kingdom and into Ireland. Here's some of the wind gusts. We had a wind gust reported over 200 kilometers per hour.\nNow, the winds are still going to be there even going into Monday, lingering into Tuesday. But by then, we're seeing that impact across the mainland of Europe. All of these areas from around Paris, into Frankfurt, all the way into Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, that's where we're going to see some of the stronger winds with the rainfall. So anticipate river flooding here, problems with transportation. They are saying that Ciara is one of the strongest storm systems that has been seen across the United Kingdom since 1993.\nAll right, for the most part, I just took a look at some of the weather conditions across London into Scotland. It's cold. There is a very cold rain. The wind is fairly brisk. But we are looking at even more precipitation making its way into the lowlands and into Paris, also into Germany and then winding its way further towards the east. So there are amber alerts out for a good portion of the U.K., even going into Monday, but also going into Tuesday as well.\nAnd look at this phenomenal picture of the waves crashing and we think of the wind, as I mentioned, but there was at least knee-deep precipitation in some areas. The flights were delayed, trains were seen being interrupted by trees on railroad tracks. There you see one tree on a roadway there, so plenty of damage. Also going into the forecast for Tuesday from Scotland all the way to Northern Ireland and in the region around Manchester, amber alert for gusty winds and could be near blizzard conditions.\nBack to you, guys.\nALLEN: All right\nM. HOLMES: Wow, that is.\nALLEN: Rough stuff. M. HOLMES: That is, isn't it? Yes, very severe. Karen Maginnis, Thank you.\nALLEN: All right. Still to come here, crews under quarantine, thousands of passengers remain on lockdown on a ship in Japan as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise on board. We'll go live to Yokohama with the latest.\nM. HOLMES: And then later in the program, the winners, the losers, the big surprises at the Oscars, a good night to be Korean. Stay with us, we'll be right back.\n[00:30:00]\nHOLMES: Welcome back. The number of cases of coronavirus on that cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan, continues to climb as thousands on board are under lockdown. Six new cases confirmed on the Diamond Princess on Sunday, bringing the total number to 70. And once the ship did dock there, where several people were taken off to hospitals for quarantine.\nLet's get the very latest now from Matt Rivers, who's on the spot for us in Yokohama. Bring us the latest on those patient passengers and those who aren't patients, are patient.\nMATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Yes, that's one way to put it, Michael. They're being as patient as they can be, given the fact that they are quarantined on this ship until February 19 at the earliest at this point.\nWe did get some -- a little bit of new information from the Japanese government this morning, with government officials telling CNN that they do plan on, or at least are considering testing every single person on board that ship.\nPreviously, they were testing those who had come in close contact with people who had already been diagnosed with the virus or people who were exhibiting symptoms. But now it appears that they are going to go through and test every single person path on that ship, which is a lengthy process, given the amount of people on board. There's some 3,700 people, minus those who have already been taken off. But that still leaves thousands of people that need testing.\nThis comes at the same time as the Japanese government continues to deliver supplies to those on board, including masks. One of the things here in Japan that you're going to see everybody doing on the streets, generally, is wearing these surgical masks they believe will help prevent the spread of this infection. Except, in kind of a cruel twist, a lot of the world's production of masks comes from Wuhan, which is the center of where this outbreak started, including Japan's supply of masks.\nAnd so what the Japanese government has said is they are going to help companies here in Japan ramp up their own position of masks, which will, of course, go to some people on that ship. But the vast majority of which will be, you know, bought by the private market here, you know, just by ordinary people on the mainland.\nHOLMES: Yes. That is extraordinary, masks from Wuhan.\nYou know, we were speaking to a passenger on the program the other day. You know, you're in touch with a lot of passengers. She was saying that they were concerned whether the quarantine deadline date that they'd been given would perhaps restart with every new infection, and that was something that concerned her. What do you know about that date?\nRIVERS: We've been asking that question to Japanese officials and to U.S. government officials, and they are saying no, that is not going to be pushed back. Now, that could always change. I mean, this is a very fluid situation, but as of now, this date of February 19 is what these governments are sticking to. They are saying that that is when the quarantine period is going to end, despite the fact that new cases have been reported. They haven't changed that.\nBut with the caveat there that they always give is that, look, this is changing. You know, if there is a rash of new cases that come out on board this ship, if something happens where they feel like they need to extend that quarantine period, they will. But as of now, the fears that the passenger that you spoke to yesterday and others that we've spoken to, that this -- this period may go forward, they do seem to be unfounded, at least according to the government officials that we're speaking to.\nHOLMES: All right. Matt Rivers, appreciate it. There on the spot in Yokohama for us. Thanks so much.\nNATALIE ALLEN, CNN ANCHOR: Oscar voters have spoken. Just ahead, we have the historic winners, the losers and all the highlights from the Academy Awards.\n[00:36:36]\nALLEN: All right. Back to our top story. The 2020 Academy Awards. In case you were watching, the Korean black comedy \"Parasite\" is the big winner of the night, and it made history in the process. It has become the first non-English film to win the top prize of Best Picture. It's the 92nd Academy Awards.\nBong Joon Ho is also taking home the Best Director award for the film. Joaquin Phoenix wins Best Actor for his performance in \"Joker.\" That was expected. Renee Zellweger, also expected, with the Best Actress for the title role in \"Judy.\"\nBrad Pitt won for Best Supporting Actor in Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\" And Laura Dern taking home Best Supporting Actress for her performance in \"Marriage Story.\"\nFor more on the winners, losers and surprises, let's turn to film critic Richard Fitzwilliams.\nRichard, \"Parasite\" rules the night. What did you think of that one?\nRICHARD FITZWILLIAMS, FILM CRITIC: Well, I think it was a very historic day for the Oscars, and also an extremely significant one for cinema internationally, because Hollywood has always been synonymous with the film industry. I mean, there's no showcase like the Oscars. And always before -- and this is the 12th film that was not in the English language to be nominated for Best Picture -- none of the others have one. And this, against the odds, \"1917\" by Sam Mendes, a remarkable film, was nonetheless beaten into second place by \"Parasite,\" which is an absolutely chilling example of social injustice, which has been highlighted by Bong Joon Ho, a South Korean director who really showed absolutely extraordinary magnetism in the way he handled this movie.\nAnd it's a dark comedy. It will lead you down into, shall we say, recesses which you did not think you would be going down when you originally begin watching this film.\nAnd the electrifying moment was when Bong Joon Ho won Best Director, and then the film won Best International Feature Film, which is the new name for Best Foreign Film. And subsequently, we were prepared, I think, for what actually happened, which of course, was the defeat of \"1917\" and \"Parasite's\" victory.\nALLEN: Yes. And it was really cool when he pointed out a line that he heard years ago, that he bases his movies on, and then he said it was Martin Scorsese who said that line. And of course, he just beat his hero as Best Director.\nLet's move to Joaquin Phoenix. He gave a very emotional acceptance speech, very deep about inequality and all areas of life. It was quite beautiful.\nFITZWILLIAMS: It was, indeed. And I mean, he feels tremendously strongly about this. He did it at the BAFTAs, as well, where he condemned systemic racism. And there's no question that Phoenix speaks from the heart. His roles -- he more or less inhabits these parts. And it was an amazing performance in an ultra-violent movie. \"Joker\" certainly shakes you up.\nBut he is a deeply, deeply sincere individual, and this comes across in his speeches. We expected him to win. There was no question about that, just as Renee Zellweger won playing Judy Garland and pointed out that she herself had never won an Oscar, and this was truly remarkable, playing a role which she found so deeply moving.\n[00:40:18]\nAlso, Brad Pitt and I have to ask who writes Brad Pitt's speeches, because they're always hits? I mean, this is one of Oscar's mysteries at the moment. And Laura Dern, of course, as we expected, Best Supporting Actress.\nALLEN: Right. And you know, it's kind of like a comeback for Renee Zellweger, wasn't it? I mean, she kind of went away from Hollywood, and she came back with a zinger.\nFITZWILLIAMS: Well, of course, she'd won before with \"Cold Mountain.\" And when I saw \"Judy,\" I mean, the film got mixed reviews, but there's no question she was able to inhabit Judy Garland's character in her last period, and make it tremendously moving.\nAnd I think that, in a speech that was -- it was quite long, actually, I noticed that this -- in this ceremony you didn't have the orchestra striking up when speeches went over 45 seconds, which is just as well.\nALLEN: Yes.\nFITZWILLIAMS: And I think relishing this moment, but also using it in a very, very sincere way to communicate with her audience, which I thought she did beautifully, it really was a remarkable moment. And it was an evening, as well, which showed that the Academy Awards can move along as a swift pace without a host. It was rather fun seeing Steve Martin and Chris Rock, who hosted in the past, just briefly appear and say how relieved they were they didn't have the responsibility. But in fact, this is the way, I think, for the -- for the ceremony to move on quite quickly.\nALLEN: Right.\nFITZWILLIAMS: With songs including Elton John's for \"Rocketman,\" of course.\nALLEN: Yes. We were talking about that in the newsroom. You know, after a while, you're like, OK, enough already, but you know, it was a pretty cool ceremony tonight, wouldn't you agree, Michael?\nHOLMES: I agree.\nALLEN: So back to \"Parasite.\" Last thing from you. Is this a game changer for Hollywood?\nFITZWILLIAMS: It's undoubtedly a game changer for Hollywood and also for the entire worldwide motion picture industry, because what we'll also see, I hope, is the Best Actor and Best Actress categories open up more to those -- there have been 36 nominated over the years, but only three have won: Sophia Loren for \"Two Women,\" Marion Cotillard playing Edith Piaf in \"Ma Vie en Rose,\" and Roberto Benigni for \"Life is Beautiful.\" And that's over 92 years.\nIt will open us up much more to non-English cinema, and also this is, I think, a gesture towards inclusivity. We've been critical of the Oscars this year for a lack of diversity. Well, you couldn't get anything more inclusive than the ceremony that you've just had.\nALLEN: Absolutely. It's nice to see it's going global.\nAll right. Richard, always a pleasure. Thanks so much for coming on.\nFITZWILLIAMS: Great pleasure.\nALLEN: All right. We've got to go see \"Parasite.\"\nHOLMES: I do, too. And our colleague, Kristie Lu Stout, has been tweeting, saying there's -- recommending a bunch of these other movies, \"Snowpiercer.\" I've never heard of it. They're apparently fantastic. I liked his last line, one of his few lines in English: \"And I shall drink until morning.\"\nALLEN: I know. He said that, like, two or three times on stage.\nHOLMES: I think everybody -- yes.\nALLEN: He deserves it.\nHOLMES: Thanks for watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Michael Holmes.\nALLEN: I'm Natalie Allen. WORLD SPORT's next. We'll see you in 15.\n[00:45:26]\n(WORLD SPORT)\n[00:57:16]"}, {"text": "There was a moment, a tangible moment, where Director Bong transcended from \"well-respected director\" and became a bona-fide Savior of Cinema. It was right after Parasite won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Foreign Language. It was a significant win, signaling many more to come (not that we knew that at the time). Director Bong got on the stage, along with his translator Sharon Choi, and proceeded to deliver this iconic quote: \"Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films\"\nIt's been five months since Parasite was released in the US last year, and just one month since its historic (and well-deserved) win at the Academy Awards, so famous for getting it so spectacularly wrong, who here got it spectacularly right (it's a decision so good, it almost makes up for Green Book two years ago. You know, almost). Here's how you know this one's gonna last, how we've got a long-lasting masterpiece on our hands; it's been a month, and the feeling about Parasite winning all those Oscars is still one of elation. Apart from some inane ramblings from our Commander in Chief (weird, how easy it is to block that out after a while. We've had some practice...), there's been absolutely nothing substantial in the way of pushback, or backlash, or any \"Hot Takes\" about the validity of the movie; was Parasite reeeeeeeeaaaally that good? Everyone seems to be on the same page that, yes, yes it was. Parasite is now in the coveted position that films like Schindler's List, No Country for Old Men or Unforgiven have, where there were other good movies that came out those years (seriously go back and look; 2007 wasstacked when it came to content), but general consensus seems to be, \"Yeah that was the right call.\"\nMonths (and many viewings) later, what I initially said about Parasite still holds true. If you've not seen it yet, the best thing to do is to go in as blind as possible. The joy of Parasite has to do with how seamlessly Director Bong (who wrote the movie along with Han Jin-own) toys with expectations; I mentioned in my initial review that, for American audiences who only know Director Bong through his slightly straighter genre pieces, like his monster movie sendup The Host, or his action movie Snowpiercer, the free range he has over every genre or tone in the book might throw them for a loop. Is this a drama? A comedy? A parable? A social satire? Who cares? It's anything and everything, and it is magnificent.\nAs has been said before, and with more eloquence, the parasites in Parasite are very human. Or maybe it's society. Either way Parasite has to do with an impoverished, unemployed family of four; a son, a daughter, a father and a mother. There is a striking opening scene in which a fumigation crew starts dusting the street outside, and the family makes the decision to leave their windows open. After all, this way their roach problem gets dealt with. For free! Things kick off when a friend of Ki-woo-the son in the family-asks him to fill in as a tutor to the daughter of a rich family. The friend is going on vacation, and doesn't trust any of the other tutors at his school not to make lecherous advances at the rich family's underage daughter. He suggests to Ki-woo that the latter assumes his identity; a deception, sure, but a harmless one.\nThings take an interesting turn when Ki-woo - under the assumed name \"Kevin\" - first arrives at the house of the wealthy Park family. Or, more accurately, their mansion. They live on a hill in the sky, surrounded by luxury, with wide open space and amenities as far as the eye can see. The contrast between them and the Kim family - who we see live in a sub-basement hovel that routinely gets pissed on by drunk passerbys - is striking. The difference between the two families is made immediately apparent; their social standing is emphasized by the geography. They are literally miles above the poor. Thanks to the hedges, they don't even have to look at them most of the time.\nUpon finding himself immersed in their world, \"Kevin\" concocts a plan. It's innocent enough - the Park family's hyperactive son needs an art therapist, and in an apparently off-the-cuff flash of inspiration, Ki-woo suggests his sister. Never mind that she's not got a degree in any of the places \"Kevin\" suggests that she has; a bit of light forgery will soon fix that. As for the fact that she's got no idea what the responsibilities of an art therapist actually are? Eh, she can fake it 'till she makes it.\nIt's down to Director Bong's extraordinary skills as a storyteller that I still didn't quite know where the story was going from this point forward. It was only when Ki-jung - AKA \"Jessica\" - engaged in a blatant act of manipulation in order to get the Park family driver fired, that I began to connect the dots. Sure enough, for a while there Parasite becomes a downright Hitchcokian thriller of false identity and unbearable suspense, as slowly but surely the entire Kim family has invaded the home of the Park family, posing as the help.\nAnd that's only the beginning. From there, well, that's where the conversation lies. Is Parasite a scathing satire on Capitalism? Is it - I already did this multiple questions thing earlier. Here's what it is; brilliant, and totally in control of itself. It completely and perfectly wrangles every plot thread and thematic undercurrent in a fashion that seems singular. It's multiple messages, but at all times, it all seems to be coalesced into one message. Like I said in my initial review, I never felt that Director Bong was just throwing whatever he wanted at the wall, and seeing what stuck. There's a purpose to every tonal shift; absolutely none of it is \"random.\" Every zany digression, or apparent non-sequitur, it's all built into the very fabric of the film. And the end result is a film experience that I couldn't predict the end of, or even the next scene of, but in the end it all worked.\nThere are layers upon layers to Parasite. This is a smart, complex, important, but ultimately enjoyable movie, and you have no idea how much it warms my heart and gives me hope that so many American audiences responded so rapturously to its release. Director Bong knows the score: once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you really will be introduced to so many more amazing films. Trust me; it's true.\nReview by Sam Stashower"}, {"text": "Feb 03, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Oscars is shaping up to be filled with tight races.Whenever the awards season comes around, industry insiders are all watching to note any trends. If a film wins a Golden Globe[1] or other award, pundits believe it bodes well for that movie's Oscar chances. Of course, a lot can change from the beginning of awards season to Oscar night.But now the 2020 Academy Awards are so close. And it feels like the winners are crystallizing. \nAll four acting awards[2] \u2014 barring any major upsets \u2014 are just about locked in. Likewise, 1917 is the clear frontrunner for Best Picture. Now it looks like two other Best Picture nominees are about to own two other categories. Taika Waititi and Bong Joon-ho at the Oscars Nominees Luncheon | Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesThe same two Best Picture nominees had a very big awards weekend Of the many awards considered precursors for the Oscars, all had been given out except two. The Writer's Guild of America represents both branches of the U.S. labor unions, including both film and television writers. And the WGA Awards[3] offer a hint of what Oscar voters \u2014 or, at least, the writers in the academy \u2014 might be thinking.Likewise, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts presents annual awards widely considered the British equivalent to the Oscars. Unlike the WGA Awards, the BAFTA Awards[4] recognize cinematic accomplishments across various departments. In fact, it features nearly identical categories to the Academy Awards, making for a very easy comparison between the two.Both the WGA and BAFTA award ceremonies took place recently. And though they only have two categories in common, they chose to recognize the very same films. Taika Waititi won Best Adapted Screenplay for Jojo Rabbit[5], while Parasite[6] writers Bong Joon HoandHan Jin Won shared Best Original Screenplay.

Click the link in our bio for the full list.[7] A post shared by The Academy[8] (@theacademy) on Jan 13, 2020 at 5:45am PSTThe screenplay Oscar races are really heating up now Of course, Waititi and Bong also directed their films, which boosts their visibility and likely their Oscar chances. But what makes these WGA and BAFTA wins so impressive is how competitive the screenplay categories at the Oscars are.After all, fellow directors Quentin Tarantino, Greta Gerwig, Rian Johnson, Noah Baumbach, and Todd Phillips are all nominated for Oscars for either writing or co-writing their films. In fact, Tarantino and Gerwig were considered likely frontrunners for their original and adapted screenplays, respectively.But the WGA and BAFTA wins tell a very different story. Waititi and Bong are now gearing up for likely wins for their writing. If they do take the Oscars, the filmmakers' more offbeat tales will defeat more traditional Oscar films like Martin Scorsese's gangster epic [9]The Irishman[10] and Sam Mendes' war drama [11]1917[12].

Both Parasite and Jojo Rabbit are nominated for six Oscars[17] this year. The former has, of course, dominated the conversation as of late. One of the most critically acclaimed films of the year, Parasite is a lock to walk away with Best International Feature and is gaining steam in Best Picture[18]. So if Parasite wins Best Original Screenplay \u2014 as many feel it deserves \u2014 that win is far from the film's only or even best shot at Oscar gold.On the other hand, Jojo Rabbit hasn't been nearly as talked about in the awards circuit. In fact, Waititi's film has been on a consistent losing streak at most of the major Oscar precursors. These back-to-back wins could indicate its destiny as an Oscar-winning film. Jojo Rabbit did land a surprise Best Supporting Actress nomination[19] for Scarlett Johansson. So perhaps the writing was on the wall all along for Waititi to claim a trophy.We'll find out soon enough how well Jojo Rabbit and Parasite do on Oscar night.

His latest, \n                   Parasite                   \n, sounds as if it should be in the former category, alongside \n                   Okja                   \n and \n                   The Host                   \n, but actually belongs in the latter, with \n                   Snowpiercer                   \n and \n                   Mother                   \n - although, by the end of it, you're not so sure.\nWe tend to make a sharp distinction between genre movies and those with \"something to say\". Bong fails to notice that divide: he's made a lustrous, vibrant genre mash-up of Hitchcock thriller, social commentary, European art film and Korean schlock cinema. I don't know what to call it except a genie that, once conjured, plays in your head for weeks. A parasite, you say?\nMeet the Kim family, whose sole source of income derives from folding pizza boxes. They live virtually underground, in a crowded, messy flat partially below street level, through the window of which they are lucky to catch a glimpse of a drunk pissing against a wall, or get a free wi-fi signal. One day, the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), lands a private tutoring gig in a gated mansion at the top of a hill that belongs to a rich architect named Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) and his wife, Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Behind a lush canopy of trees and an entrance that makes a thick kerchunk sound like a vault, Ki-woo must prepare the couple's teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), for college. Ki-woo has failed his entrance exam four times, but what's a piece of paper when your sister is a dab hand at Photoshop?\nOne deception quickly begets another. When the younger Park boy, a spoilt brat obsessed with tomahawks, turns out to require a therapist to help him with his art, Ki-woo puts the family in touch with his sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), introducing her as \"Jessica\". So now there are two of them in the lap of luxury. Next up, a job for dad, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), after they frame the chauffeur; and when the long-serving, long-suffering housekeeper (Lee Jeong-eun) takes her eye off the ball, they hoodwink the Parks into hiring their mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), instead. So now there are four of them there, a full set. When the Parks go on a camping trip, the Kims simply move in for the weekend. \"Rain falling on the lawn as we sip our whiskies,\" Ki-taek says, smiling broadly, sloppily drunk.\nWho wouldn't sympathise? At the same time, who isn't absolutely certain that a comeuppance is on the way? (Keep your eye on that fired housekeeper, for the real fun has not even begun.)\nPlugging into our universal disquiet about the inequality between the haves and have-nots, Bong has fashioned a darkly enjoyable class-war thriller in which the real monster is global capitalism itself, but there is nothing heady or didactic about it. The plot clicks into place like a Rubik's cube, and the action is storyboarded with the pounce and snap of a manga comic. There is violence, yet it feels as clean and gleaming as the Parks' kitchen, around which the camera prowls like a house cat. If you've ever wondered what a production designer does, check out the immaculate, minimalist surfaces of the mansion, with its marble tables and built-in closets, then see the dramatic purposes to which each are put, and that's before we've realised there's a basement. I haven't seen the architectural plans of a house prove so integral to a movie's plot since \n                   Psycho                   \n.\nThis film's working title was \n                   Decalcomania                   \n - the process of transferring designs from paper onto glass or porcelain, creating a mirror image, or doppelganger. It's a kinder title than \n                   Parasite                   \n, to be sure, although trying to work out who exactly is the parasite of the title can be instructive.\nThe Kims feel no malice toward the Parks, who in their own way are quite likeable, even Mr Park, with his haughty conviction that the people who ride on the subway have a certain \"smell\".The Kims \"invade\" the Parks' home not to rob or kill them, but merely to earn a living. Nor are they impoverished saints - they are sprawling and a little selfish, and they get messily drunk - so you never feel hectored by a thesis. The film is far too seductive for that. Gliding from social commentary to horror movie to \n                   grand guignol                   \n farce, in which every detail - a tomahawk, a walkie-talkie, a flickering lightbulb - is orchestrated with split-second timing and loaded with portent, \n                   Parasite                   \n has the feel of a modern classic.\nAgnieszka Holland's \n                   Mr Jones                   \n begins with a writer (Joseph Mawle) in the late 1940s, bashing out an allegory about totalitarianism with farm animals on a typewriter. No, it's not a biopic of George Orwell, but something more interesting. It's a film about the Welsh journalist whose work exposing the Holodomor - the famine caused by Stalin's agricultural policies, which killed 10 million people - partly inspired Orwell's book.\nBeginning with a scene in which the 27-year-old Gareth Jones (James Norton) is laughed out of the Foreign Office by Lloyd George's cabinet for suggesting that war with Nazi Germany is imminent, the film starts out as a noirish, \n                   Third Man                   \n-like thriller, as Jones secures a journalist's visa to Russia to discover the truth about the USSR's economic expansion. The film burrows into the time just before the horrors of the gulag became known, when Stalin was thought to be a good egg by one and all, and this normalisation may be the film's most salutary lesson for today's audiences.\nBefriended by another British journalist, Ada Brooks (Vanessa Kirby), who refers to the KGB man following her as her \"big brother\", Jones travels to Ukraine and ducks his government-appointed minders to check out the conditions for himself. There the movie changes gear, and almost genre, for its portrayal of what greets him: a wintry landscape of death and starvation in desolate eastern Ukraine, where infants bawl unattended, people step around corpses lying where they fall in the street, and - in the movie's most shocking sequence - children feast on unidentified meat. Shedding noirish camera angles and Eisensteinian montage for a haunting, handheld aesthetic - it feels like a sudden dose of Tarkovsky in the middle of a thriller - Tomasz Naumiuk's cinematography fills the widescreen frame and packs a humanitarian punch that the film never again matches.\nThe more it strays towards the territory of a traditional biopic, the less successful it is. Jones and Orwell never met in person, but the screenwriter Andrea Chalupa imagines a lunch between the two men. \"I have a story, but if I tell it, six innocent men will die,\" Jones says. Thus, we are to understand, was the germ of \n                   Animal Farm                   \n born - a slight exaggeration, but not much - as Orwell began to slip away from sympathy for the Kremlin's \"great experiment\".\nI could have done without the shots of Orwell clattering away at his typewriter, but Norton gives a deeply sympathetic performance as the young, idealistic Jones, trying to expose the original fake news; Peter Sarsgaard is slithery as the Pulitzer-winning writer Walter Duranty, a slinky sybarite whose louche parties leave Norton's glasses steamed; and Kirby delivers another dose of agonised romantic ambivalence. (Someone cast her in a Graham Greene adaptation, soon.) But the star here is the 71-year-old Holland, whose directing career, after a stint directing TV for HBO, feels newly resurgent and relevant."}, {"text": "Nov 27, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Foreign films don't often receiveas much attention as big-budgeteddomestic blockbusters, let alone horror thrillers. Riding the coattails of last year's'Roma,' which walked away with a Foreign Feature nod, the South Korean hit 'Parasite' evokes similar praise and could become a Best Picture nominee, too.Known in its native language as 'Gisaengchung,' Bong Joon-Ho's 'Parasite' opened with some stellar reviews, so much so that The Hollywood Reporter[1] now claims it ranks high among the Best Picture contenders. \nSince its release, 'Parasite' has grossed $112 million worldwide and even won Cannes Film Festival's Palmer d'Or.The plot of 'Parasite' isa subtle look atthe differences inclass between that of a family living in poverty and afar more fortunate one. The story follows the impoverished family's son as he teaches English to the wealthier family's daughter. As the heart-pounding mystery of 'Parasite' unfolds, the more asequestered tension ramps up, drawing both families together for better and worse.In definingthe'Parasite' Oscar buzz, Variety's[2] Brent Lang and Claudia Eller write,'It's partly attributable to the way the movie's subversive portrait of class tensions resonates at a time when economic inequality has become a dominant political issue.'The Oscars are one weighty race. The first-ever foreign film to be nominated asBest Picture was Jean Renoir's 'The Grand Illusion' from 1938. Since then, only nine other foreign movies have made the Oscar's Best Picture cut, that being merely nominated. None have ever won.Thus far, though, it seems that 'Parasite' is on many pundits' radars. According to sources from THR, not only are a variety of Hollywood insidersdiscussing the film but nomination ballots are already being recorded with 'Parasite' at the top of the list. Says one insider: ''Roma' was a beautiful film, but it never had that 'Oh my God!' feeling. 'Parasite' is a passion vote.'A multitude of likewise belovedfilms have alsomade Best Picture buzz this year, reported via THR[3]. The list includes massive blockbusters, like 'Avengers: Endgame' and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' as well as star-studded hits like 'The Lighthouse' and 'Jojo Rabbit.' It's a contentious battle, though many still consider 'Parasite' to be at the forefront of them all. Oscars statues are pictured on March 4, 2018, in Hollywood, California.

It's disturbing, it's funny, it's thrilling and it's a truly spellbinding work of art.\u00a0\nIt's also frustratingly difficult to talk about.\nWhat makes it difficult to discuss is how scattered and truly bizarre the plot of the movie is. Set in modern-day South Korea, \"Parasite\" highlights the extreme contrasts in the standard of living and mental health between the upper and lower classes. There are constantly new developments and unexpected twists being thrown at the audience. However, instead of leading into a needlessly confusing maze of plot points, they all miraculously work together to make the film even more compelling with every turn. However, because of all of these different twists, it's basically impossible to explain what the movie is about without delving into spoilers. And trust me, you do not, under any condition, want this movie spoiled for you.\u00a0\nPrior to \"Parasite\" I had only seen two of Joon Ho's films - the aforementioned \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja.\" While I found \"Snowpiercer\" to be a thrilling experience, \"Okja\" was a little too goofy in my opinion. Despite my differing opinions on those films, the one constant was the raw talent and intensity of Joon Ho's filmmaking. In \"Parasite,\" Joon Ho shows not just that he's talented, but that he has the potential to be one of the most brilliantly idiosyncratic filmmakers in the industry.\u00a0\nFrom beginning to end, \"Parasite\" is constantly shifting and morphing through distinctive tones and moods. At times, it feels like a comedy that explores the silly social antics of people from different backgrounds. On the other hand, there are disturbingly ominous and foreboding moments of the film that will make viewers squirm in their seats. Sometimes, Joon Ho will transition between tones so subtly that the audience barely even notices what's happening. Other times, violently jarring transitions suddenly throw viewers into a vastly different situation.\u00a0\n\"Parasite\" uses these offbeat tones to trick the audience into jumping to false conclusions about what the film is about. It will seemingly be setting up one direction or story arc before flipping the entire story on its head and going down an alternate path that leads the audience further into its trap. It almost feels like \"Parasite\" is playing games with its viewers - taunting them with different expectations - only to reveal something entirely new and unforeseen. Joon Ho is consistently subverting the audience's expectations, which makes \"Parasite\" one of the most unpredictable, unconventional and unsuspectingly sensational films I've seen in a long while.\u00a0\n\"Parasite\" will get Oscar nominations, it's just a question of how many. It's a shoe-in to win Best Foreign Language Film, and it will undoubtedly get a Best Picture nomination. Whether or not it will win the top-prize is still to be seen, but I would say you should run out and experience this movie as soon as possible, not only to be thrilled by the glory of Joon Ho's filmmaking, but to become prepared to discuss it again come awards season.\nculture@dailynebraskan.com"}, {"text": "Man, the new movie by the guy who directed Snowpiercer is really picking up steam!\n...get it? Picking up steam? Because it's from the same director who did Snowpiercer? The movie about the train that never stops? Get it?\nAh, never mind...\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that Parasite is a very different kind of movie than what most 'Murican audiences will be used to from Bong Joon-ho. While he's done drama before - Barking Dogs Never Bite and Mother - over here, his most popular films are his genre pieces. Films like The Host, his take on Godzilla, Okja, which is more fantasy than anything, or the aforementioned Snowpiercer, which is all about a magical train that goes around and around the world, forever and ever...suffice it to say, I can easily imagine a scenario where someone goes into a movie called Parasite, knowing it's by the guy who made all those films, expecting another dip into sci-fi and horror, and getting what appears to be a straight-up drama instead. There are parasites in this movie...but they're all very human.\nParasite has to do with a downtrodden, out-of-work family of four. We see in the opening scene that they in such squalor that, when a fumigation crew starts dusting the street outside, they decide to leave the window open to get rid of their roach problem. For free! Things take an interesting turn, however, when a friend of Ki-woo - the son in the family - asks him to fill in as a tutor to the daughter of a rich family. Ki-woo obliges, but soon into his first day he senses an opening for his sister, Ki-jeong, to join him as an art tutor for the rich son. Never mind that she doesn't know the first thing about art, and doesn't have any credentials; nothing a bit of light forgery can't fix. Once she's there, though, she starts looking for positions for her parents. The other jobs around the household are already taken by other people, but if something were to happen to them...\nDoesn't sound much like Snowpiercer, does it? But make no mistake; Parasite comes from the same mind. For one thing, despite all appearances, it's very fluid, genre-wise. It defies simple characterization, which I always like (I'm generally of the opinion that genre restrictions are stupid). It begins as a satire, before hardening into straight drama, then back into comedy, before elements of horror start to creep in, and then...I'd better not say. But Bong Joon-ho is always in complete control; I never felt that he was just throwing whatever he wanted at the wall, and seeing what stuck. There was a purpose to the tonal shifts, and the end result was a film experience that I couldn't predict the end of, or even the next scene of.\nBut the main clue that this is a Bong Joon-ho picture is the recurring theme of class warfare. I'm bringing up Snowpiercer a lot in this review, and there's a reason for that, beyond the fact that I love it. Snowpiercer isn't just a movie about a train endlessly circling a desolate, frozen earth; it's a movie about the way the train divides its passengers into different cars based on their wealth and social status, and the eventual armed revolution by the have-nots against the haves.\nParasite isn't as fantastical as Snowpiercer, or even Okja, but it absolutely deals with the same themes. Weirdly, Parasite serves as a kind of spiritual relative to Jordan Peele's Us from earlier this year. They're both comedy-drama-horror hybrids that start out as one thing, before slowly transitioning into a parable about the lengths the disenfranchised will go, not only to survive, but to get back what they think they're owed. There's something almost supernatural about the way the family systematically attaches themselves to the rich family; watching them at work, they almost could be seen as the tethered.\nIt works, though, for two main reasons. The first, it's never moralistic, or heavy-handed. The themes are right there, but you do have to work for them. The social satire of the movie mostly comes up through contrast; for instance, when there's a downpour about midway through the movie, the poor family (I refer to them as such because we never get any last names) has to worry about their little hovel flooding. The rich family, by contrast, spend the whole day post-flood commenting on how lovely their wet grass looks, which irritates the poor family to no end.\u00a0\nThe second reason is much simpler; it's just wildly entertaining. There are sequences so brilliantly put together, the audience I saw this with was simultaneously screaming and in stitches. This is a prime example of a film that deals with heady subjects dead on, while still maintaining a high entertainment value."}, {"text": "Star Rating: 5 stars\nThe ideal way to experience South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho's awards-garlanded, international box-office smash is with as little prior knowledge as possible. So if you're reading this before seeing the film, and you've managed to avoid the whirlwind of publicity it has attracted since winning the Palme d'Or last May, it may be simpler to just stop and head straight to the cinema. Because, at the risk of adding to the hype,       \u00a0    Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going such a joy. I saw it for the fourth time last week and I'm now desperate to view the       \u00a0    black-and-white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival.\nDescribed by its creator as \"a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains\", Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian - a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong's back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), in their lowly semi-basement home, hunting for stray wifi coverage and leaving their windows open to benefit from bug-killing street fumigation. They have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family.\nAn architectural wonder perched high above the slums of Seoul, with views not of urinating drunks but of luxurious lawns and starlit skies, this wealthy house is everything the Kims' pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. It's a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), who stayed with the building after its original architect owner moved out. Spying an opening, Ki-woo (newly dubbed \"Kevin\") realises that his own family could easily fill such roles, and hatches a plan that will inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks.\nBeyond the deliberate ambiguity of the title (which, like Jordan Peele's oddly comparable Us, cuts both ways), Bong once again foregrounds a distrust of wealth and authority that has been a recurrent feature of his work since his 2003 breakout Memories of Murder, continuing through films as diverse as The Host, Mother, Okja and, of course,       \u00a0    Snowpiercer, to which Parasite contains several knowing nods.\nThe Kim family may live in sewage-flooded squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of \"people who ride the subway\". Similarly, while the smug Mr Park is habitually depicted ascending the stairs of his ultra-modern home, and the Kims are pictured scampering down city steps to their own underworld apartment, it's clear who holds the dramatic high ground.\nWhen it comes to deception, too, those on the upper rungs of the societal ladder are as practised as those upon whom they look down. In a world of vertical non-integration, Parasite finds gasp-inducing depths lurking beneath even the most apparently placid surfaces. Yet Bong is careful to keep his opposing forces keenly balanced, creating the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot test in which the audience is invited to decide for themselves the precise meaning of these strangely symmetrical apparitions.\nPerfectly accompanying the film's tonal shifts is Jung Jae-il's magnificently modulated music, which moves from the sombre piano patterns of the curtain-raiser, through the mini symphony of The Belt of Faith to the cracked craziness of cues in which choric vocals do battle with a musical saw. Just as the action can segue from slapstick to horror and back - sometimes within the space of a single scene - so Jung plays things straight even as madness beckons, ensuring that the underlying elements of pathos are amplified rather than undercut by pastiche.\nFor me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multitonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."}, {"text": "Dec 09, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  South Korea's Bong Joon Ho has been named the Best Director by The Los Angeles Film Critics Association while his movie 'Parasite' was labeled the Best Film of the year.According to the Hollywood Reporter[1], the acclaimed movie won three trophies, including Best Supporting Actor award for Song Kang Ho.

I thought it was for the best that I keep it that way and try to see the movie as soon as possible to see what all the buzz was about.I'm glad I did. Bong Joon-Ho's 2019 movie about class and desperation is a lot of different things at once. It's partially a comedy. \nIt has aspects of being a thriller. It is dramatic and thoughtful. Parasite shifts as it treks along and continually leaves you guessing as to what is next, and knowing just some cursory data made the ride with it all the better. If at all possible, see this movie without going in with too much information. (And in the interest of that, I'll remain spoiler-free until I give a warning that they are forthcoming) The story is of a South Korean family-the Kims (Kang-Ho Song as patriarch Ki-Taek, So-Dam Park as Ki-jung, Woo-Sik Choi as Ki-woo, and Hye-Jin Jang as the mother, Chung-sook)-who are living in abject poverty, folding pizza boxes (poorly!) for a meager living. Bums routinely pee in the street right outside their window, their wi-fi and cell phones have been shut off, and stinkbugs and cockroaches are claiming their home for themselves. When Ki-Woo's friend offers to get him a lucrative job tutoring a sophomore who comes from a wealthy family, his whole family becomes possessed of greed. Through a chain of deception, all of the Kims get hired as various employees of the Park family, even when they have to get long-standing staff fired to do so.From there things happen. I can't give it away (yet)! At one point, my wife turned to me and asked, 'Are these good people?' in regards to the Kims. It's a good question. They are duplicitous and show only brief and minor self-reflection at their own activities. Still, they don't quite seem as nefarious as they do desperate and needy. They are certainly greedy and short-sighted, sure, but when presented with an opportunity to improve their station in life, all they know is that they have to. So are they 'good' people? No. Then are they 'bad'? Also no. They just seem realistic and pitiable, and both the script and the actors themselves are brilliant in keeping these characters in their lane and not leaning into becoming one-dimensional. It's helped by the fact that, as con people should be, the Kims are entirely charming and likable in spite of what their deceit. And Bong Joon-Ho's screenplay is so much fun with its mood shifts. They movie flows from making you laugh to having you grip your armrest with seamless grace. And even in its most intense moments, it can find a way to make you laugh again (mirrored in the fate of one of the characters). Parasite creates a cornucopia of feelings inside its viewer as it goes, and I really enjoyed it. I will attest to a few things: Mostly in that the ending is something of a letdown. Even if it does bring everything full circle to a degree. So if you haven't seen it, do so. It's not flawless, but it's great fun, and the acting is unimpeachable. (As a side note apropos of nothing, my favorite moment of the movie might have been when my wife, who clearly thought this was going to be something else entirely, turned to me after about 30 minutes and asked 'Where the hell are the zombies at?') So are we ready for SPOILERS?So having known that the film had a bit of a thriller aspect to it, I was expecting that the ultimate storyline would be that the Parks were always aware of the Kims' machinations and would eventually turn on the family somehow. That isn't even close. The Parks are as aloof and oblivious as the movie portrays them. Instead, the movie turns when the Parks are away for a camping trip and the Kims claim the house for themselves. While partying into the night, the former housekeeper that was fired in their wake shows up and reveals that her husband has been living in a secret shelter under the house for years to avoid debt collection. Ha! Didn't see that coming! Just when things are looking EVEN BETTER for the Kims-the housekeeper offers them a monthly bribe to keep the secret resident cared for-they (literally) slip up and reveal themselves. With the Parks calling to announce they are returning early, the movie descends into a mad dash as the Kims try to subdue their surprise guests, remove any sign of their own mess, and make the Parks dinner for their arrival. It's all delightfully frantic while also gloriously intense. Characters fall into a pile of bodies to wrestle away a cell phone with an incriminating video, brawl to restrain each other in the basement, shove debris under a table, and make ram-don. It's the juxtaposition of the latter two normally mundane activities against the much more dire former ones that sells the scene because it ALL feels important. While these characters are literally fighting each other to protect their various secrets, you as a viewer are left screaming in your head, 'They're eight minutes away! Clean up the chips you were eating!' With the Parks back home, the movie remains both humorously zany and white-knuckling intense while the Kims try to escape the home with the homeowners settling in after their aborted trip. The movie showcases how much success simple visuals can have when Ki-Taek snake-crawls his way out from under a table and then comes to a dead stop when the homeowners wake up. A great combination of 'acting' and cinematography for another moment that shouldn't work on as many levels as it does. The climax of the movie turns to tragedy when everything goes wrong for everyone, honestly. While the Park couple has been relatively sin free all movie, we see that they don't care at all about their 'help' when Ki-Jung is bleeding to death on their lawn, and their lack of concern finally breaks Ki-Taek, causing him to stab his employer to death and flee the scene.The turns and shifts that Parasite takes really shouldn't work, but the direction and the work put in by the cast just sell everything. When Ki-woo wakes up after suffering a pretty severe head trauma, he finds he can't stop laughing even when faced with awful situations not unlike how the film has made you chuckle throughout even when the stakes have been high. Even the parts of the movie I didn't think needed to be there ultimately work if you think about them. Ki-woo's relationship with Da-Hye-the daughter of the Parks-feels like it is extraneous, but it works when you see him carrying around the rock that his friend Min gave to him earlier in the film. Min also gave him the job with The Parks and noted he trusted Ki-woo not to lust after Da-Hye. Ki-woo then carries the rock as the symbol of the guilt that is weighing him down. It seems obvious in hindsight, but it took some reconsideration to see how it all fit. Likewise, Ki-woo fast-talking his way into a job interview at the pizza restaurant doesn't go anywhere, but it establishes how quick-witted and opportunistic he is for when he meets Mrs. Park and almost immediately gets Ki-Jung an interview with the family. It's character building 101, but done sneakily enough that it caught me later when I was putting together the pieces. This is a movie I initially liked, but the more I think about it, I might kind of love. It has already gone from 'That was fun and weird' to 'That was pretty well-layered and purposeful'.

Its subject matter cuts right to the heart of the economic class division in South Korea, in a way that appeals universally to income disparity worldwide.\nI honestly feel bad for those who are wealthy and affluent. And, I feel only pity for the rich and famous. Because you lose something when you reach your dreams and live on top of the mountain of your achievement; this separates a person from what it is like to actually live. Failure gains a new connotation when it is no longer synonymous with homelessness or poverty, as wealth becomes a safety net to correct mistakes.\nNot to say that money is a bad thing - far from it. Money is necessary for exactly this reason, beyond meeting our basic needs money frees us to live fuller lives, pursuing individual interests. But money has a price to itself as well, in that extreme realm of the celebrity where privilege is lost for privacy.\nIn our reality, there are things a celebrity will never have. The chance to walk down the street, go to the store. Ride a bike, even be in a public place. Funny, that our most public figures can't use public spaces. If they did, they'd be mobbed by fans for pictures or autographs. The phenomenon is like a reply to the old retort, \"This is why we can't have nice things.\" That when a thing becomes available to everyone is precisely when someone will come along to break it. Hence, we break the people we follow.\nSo a celebrity will never have that love of a stranger meeting a stranger and talking of something inconsequential. The weather, an object of curiosity in the surrounding, only that it be something besides themselves. Having a world not interested in them, because once fame digs its fangs in, there is no going back beyond losing exactly what it has bitten.\nAnd so celebrities will continue to pay more and more to give themselves the security that they lost in their anonymity. Ironic, that the more influential a person becomes the more they have to spend to put a facade over the fact. Money, what comes with fame and success, becomes a necessary commodity to maintain a barrier between the celebrity and the pedestrian. Similarly, an economic line is drawn when this occurs, one that distinguishes the wealthy individual from the lower class. Hence, a type of elitism is born.\nAs part of this elitism, the ultra-rich are no longer able to interact with others in a peer-to-peer environment. A celebrity loses that similar connection that can come from people with a similar history or background. As Chung-sook says in \"Parasite\": \"Rich people are naive, no resentments. No creases on them. It all gets ironed out.\nMoney is an iron.\" With the increasing gap between the rich and poor in South Korea and other nations abroad, the wealthy class disconnects from its poverty-stricken, lower-class neighbors.\nWith wealth you don't need to be nice - you can be a pretentious and arrogant and people will still love you for your money. And yet for the wealthy people who are nice, I can only think of the freedom that money gave them to be that way. A \"plan B,\" where if they were faced with tragedy they could still grin and bear it for remaining financially unaffected by the loss.\nNobody plans for complications or stumbling blocks, and yet they happen. Misfortune can happen at any time - storms, earthquakes or floods. In natural disasters alone, without a financial safety net, the lives of the people affected by these events are devastated. Imagine: a man has a heart attack at the wheel of a car and smashes into an oncoming car. If you're the oncoming car, how can you plan for that event? You can't, and so the only argument that holds sway is to say that nothing matters. In the words of the impoverished father in \"Parasite,\" Ki-taek, \"With no plan, nothing can go wrong. And if something spins out of control, it doesn't matter.\"\nAt this point, the film industry as a whole leaves me feeling jaded. Between the viewers who become obsessed with artists and their work, and the wealthy class of individuals that cannot blend into that viewership for their cult-like following, it paints a crass picture of the economic disparity on both ends.\nSimultaneously, Allegheny College sponsored a concert featuring Bryce Vine for its student population this month, to rousing student applause and widespread community approval.

Considered one of the greatest actors of European cinema, his biggest successes include films like\u00a0'Purple Noon,'\u00a0'Le Samourai'\u00a0and\u00a0'The Leopard.'\nHowever, the award attracted\u00a0controversy this year, with the \"Women and Hollywood\" group saying that honouring a man who has admitted to hitting women \"sucks.\"\nIn recent years, the festival has become a pioneer in the fight against the rise of\u00a0the Netflix streaming model for films.\nIn contrast to the festivals in Berlin and Venice, Cannes does not show any productions in the competition which do not run in theatres. Cannes sees this as a statement of solidarity with cinemas, which means new films by star directors like Martin Scorsese or Steven Soderbergh have not been invited to participate.\nThis year, the competition line-up only featured four films by female directors. \"In the Men's Club of Cannes, this could be described as progress,\" mocked the German newspaper\u00a0S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\u00a0Indeed, there have been even fewer female directors in recent Cannes\u00a0competitions.

It is\u00a0likely to be met with great interest.\nTelling the story of an autistic youth, the comedy features acting greats\u00a0such as Vincent Cassel and Reda Kateb, and\u00a0plenty of fresh talent.

A brief overview of the best moments.\nBong Joon-Ho, winner of the Palme d'or for\u00a0'Gisaengchung'\u00a0(Parasite):\nAt a press conference, I said that I was drawing in this film on a form of humour specific to South Korea. I was sure that not all spectators would understand, but I'm happy to see I was wrong. That's because this film is about a family story. I mix genres, it's my style, and that's why I'm even happier to win this award. My influences for this film are Hitchcock, Chabrol, but also Im Sang-soo, who directed\u00a0'Hanyo'\u00a0(The Housemaid). I don't think I'm the only Korean director with the ability to win such an award. I would like to be able to organise retrospectives to shine a spotlight on Korean cinema.\nMati Diop, winner of the Grand Prix with\u00a0'Atlantique'\u00a0(Atlantics):\nI was overwhelmed by the situation. Seeing all the world's cinema greats in front of you and receiving this award is something else. This film goes way back. I've been carrying it within me for a long time. The subject is ambitious, it talks about a situation that seemed important to me and I wanted to talk about it. I was very surprised by the way it aroused people's emotions. I could feel how it affected them. It's a relief, a great opportunity. The shooting was very connected to reality, to the streets of Dakar. Unconsciously, I wanted to keep the documentary spirit of this film.\nLadj Ly, winner of the Jury Prize (tied) with\u00a0'Les Mis\u00e9rables':\nI'm very happy and proud. It's been an incredible adventure. We had been trying to edit this film for ten years. It was not easy to get funding. We had to fight for this and that's why we're happy. We have been \"yellow jackets\" in the suburbs for 20 years, claiming our rights and being subjected to police violence. The causes are the same, our struggle is the same.\nEmily Beecham, winner of the Best Actress award for her role in\u00a0'Little Joe,'\u00a0by Jessica Hausner:\nI had no idea what was going to happen when I walked up the stairs tonight. And then I was overwhelmed with emotions because it's my first prize. What I had to do for this role was challenging. As an actress, I had to be as open as possible. There's something blocked in the character I played. We were very precise in the choreography of the shooting. We kept to a certain rhythm with the camera.\nAntonio Banderas, winner of the Best Actor award for his role in\u00a0'Dolor y gloria'\u00a0(Pain and Glory) by Pedro Almod\u00f3var:\nIt's an incredibly unique thing for me. I've been nominated for almost all the awards except the Oscars, but I never got to go up on stage. My cardiologist must have been stressed out sitting in front of his screen! Almod\u00f3var? He is my mentor, I respect him a great deal. I wish he was here today. I thank him for these forty years of career and the eight films we made together.\nKleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho and Juliano Dornelles, winners of the Jury award (tied) with\u00a0'Bacurau':\nIt's slowly beginning to dawn on us that this film, which has been in the making for ten years, has received an award. It is a real honour. Especially since in Brazil, culture is managed by sad white men. We will continue to keep in direct touch with Brazilian reality. We are pleased that the film has been recognised as a genre film. Cinema in Brazil will be subject to severe budget cuts. This award comes at an important time when Brazilian cinema is being destroyed from the inside.\nC\u00e9sar Diaz, winner of the Cam\u00e9ra d'Or with\u00a0'Nuestras Madres'\u00a0(Our Mothers):\nGiven the subject of the film, I needed to film while holding back. It was difficult because I was coming to the end of a process. We had a historical responsibility around this subject so we took great care over it. We had to create space for the spectator's emotions.\nJean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, winners of the Best Director Award for\u00a0'Le Jeune Ahmed' (Young Ahmed):\nWe never won this award before. We've dreamed about it. Directing is at the heart of the work we do. Cinema films life, the quivering of things, the little things that move and the movements of the body. We owe a great deal to our actor Idir Ben Addi. He has an innate sense of rhythm and rhythm is very important when it comes to directing. He had a lot of fun on the set. We shot an arrow, and Idir was that arrow, that we so obstinately tried to film. An actor is always a third, fourth, fifth director. Directing is about finding out how to live the inside of a character.\nC\u00e9line Sciamma, winner of the Best Screenplay prize with\u00a0'Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu' (Portrait of a Lady on Fire):\nIt's been an exceptional year. The selection was very good, and the list of winners was just as good. I am delighted to be a part of it. Writing can take years. There is an energy born of loneliness. I try to write emotional journeys. The film had to tell its own story, so that it would become the language of the audience. I wanted to make an impact on the spectators' retinas. Erotic scenes can be very joyful to shoot, it's like making little jokes.\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/9/11/38/155897524291.jpg\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/9/11/99/155897524342.jpg\nhttp://imgs.syndigate.info/9/11/6/155897524387.jpg"}, {"text": "Link to Image\nLink to Story\nFilmmaker Bong Joon-ho on Saturday became the first South Korean to win\u00a0the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious top prize, the Palme d'Or,\u00a0with his film\u00a0'Parasite.'\nThe tragicomic film explores the growing gap between rich and poor by telling the story of two families at opposite ends of the economic spectrum in South Korea.\n\"The film is laugh-out-loud funny, an astute blend of humanity and absurdity, thrilling until its final depraved moments, a pristinely-shot modern architectural feast for the eyes, a razor-sharp socioeconomic critique, and a cryptic operatic drama,\" wrote filmmaking news site\u00a0Film School Rejects in a review.\nFor many critics, the choice for the top prize among the 21 contenders\u00a0was especially difficult at\u00a0the world's most influential international film festival.\nSome believed Sciamma would win it, making her only the second female to do so in the prize's history.

Considered one of the greatest actors of European cinema, his biggest successes include films like\u00a0'Purple Noon,'\u00a0'Le Samourai'\u00a0and\u00a0'The Leopard.'\nHowever, the award attracted\u00a0controversy this year, with the 'Women and Hollywood' group saying that honouring a man who has admitted to hitting women \"sucks.\"\nIn recent years, the festival has become a pioneer in the fight against the rise of\u00a0the Netflix streaming model for films.\nIn contrast to the festivals in Berlin and Venice, Cannes does not show any productions in the competition which do not run in theatres. Cannes sees this as a statement of solidarity with cinemas, which means new films by star directors like Martin Scorsese or Steven Soderbergh have not been invited to participate.\nThis year, the competition line-up only featured four films by female directors. \"In the Men's Club of Cannes, this could be described as progress,\" mocked the German newspaper\u00a0S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung.\u00a0Indeed, there have been even fewer female directors in recent Cannes\u00a0competitions. Apart from Austrian Jessica Hausner, three French directors, Mati Diop, Celine Sciamma, and Justine Triet, were selected in this year's\u00a0race for the Palm d'Or.\nClosing the festival is a film by successful directing duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano,\u00a0'Hors Normes'\u00a0(The Specials), screened out of competition on Saturday. It is\u00a0likely to be met with great interest.\nTelling the story of an autistic youth, the comedy features acting greats\u00a0such as Vincent Cassel and Reda Kateb, and\u00a0plenty of fresh talent. The directors' biggest hit was\u00a0'Untouchable'\u00a0in 2011, while their lively wedding film\u00a0'C'est la Vie!'\u00a0was released two years ago.\nThe winners of this 72nd Festival appeared before the press at the end of the Closing Ceremony to express their joy in having been awarded the prizes. A brief overview of the best moments.\nBong Joon-Ho, winner of the Palme d'or for\u00a0'Gisaengchung'\u00a0(Parasite):\nAt a press conference, I said that I was drawing in this film on a form of humour specific to South Korea. I was sure that not all spectators would understand, but I'm happy to see I was wrong. That's because this film is about a family story. I mix genres, it's my style, and that's why I'm even happier to win this award. My influences for this film are Hitchcock, Chabrol, but also Im Sang-soo, who directed\u00a0'Hanyo'\u00a0(The Housemaid). I don't think I'm the only Korean director with the ability to win such an award. I would like to be able to organise retrospectives to shine a spotlight on Korean cinema.\nMati Diop, winner of the Grand Prix with\u00a0'Atlantique'\u00a0(Atlantics):\nI was overwhelmed by the situation. Seeing all the world's cinema greats in front of you and receiving this award is something else. This film goes way back. I've been carrying it within me for a long time. The subject is ambitious, it talks about a situation that seemed important to me and I wanted to talk about it. I was very surprised by the way it aroused people's emotions. I could feel how it affected them. It's a relief, a great opportunity. The shooting was very connected to reality, to the streets of Dakar. Unconsciously, I wanted to keep the documentary spirit of this film.\nLadj Ly, winner of the Jury Prize (tied) with\u00a0'Les Mis\u00e9rables':\nI'm very happy and proud. It's been an incredible adventure. We had been trying to edit this film for ten years. It was not easy to get funding. We had to fight for this and that's why we're happy. We have been \"yellow jackets\" in the suburbs for 20 years, claiming our rights and being subjected to police violence. The causes are the same, our struggle is the same.\nEmily Beecham, winner of the Best Actress award for her role in\u00a0'Little Joe,'\u00a0by Jessica Hausner:\nI had no idea what was going to happen when I walked up the stairs tonight. And then I was overwhelmed with emotions because it's my first prize. What I had to do for this role was challenging. As an actress, I had to be as open as possible. There's something blocked in the character I played. We were very precise in the choreography of the shooting. We kept to a certain rhythm with the camera.\nAntonio Banderas, winner of the Best Actor award for his role in\u00a0'Dolor y gloria'\u00a0(Pain and Glory) by Pedro Almod\u00f3var:\nIt's an incredibly unique thing for me. I've been nominated for almost all the awards except the Oscars, but I never got to go up on stage. My cardiologist must have been stressed out sitting in front of his screen! Almod\u00f3var? He is my mentor, I respect him a great deal. I wish he was here today. I thank him for these forty years of career and the eight films we made together.\nKleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho and Juliano Dornelles, winners of the Jury award (tied) with\u00a0'Bacurau':\nIt's slowly beginning to dawn on us that this film, which has been in the making for ten years, has received an award. It is a real honour. Especially since in Brazil, culture is managed by sad white men. We will continue to keep in direct touch with Brazilian reality. We are pleased that the film has been recognised as a genre film. Cinema in Brazil will be subject to severe budget cuts. This award comes at an important time when Brazilian cinema is being destroyed from the inside.\nC\u00e9sar Diaz, winner of the Cam\u00e9ra d'Or with\u00a0'Nuestras Madres'\u00a0(Our Mothers):\nGiven the subject of the film, I needed to film while holding back. It was difficult because I was coming to the end of a process. We had a historical responsibility around this subject so we took great care over it. We had to create space for the spectator's emotions.\nJean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, winners of the Best Director Award for\u00a0'Le Jeune Ahmed' (Young Ahmed):\nWe never won this award before. We've dreamed about it. Directing is at the heart of the work we do. Cinema films life, the quivering of things, the little things that move and the movements of the body. We owe a great deal to our actor Idir Ben Addi. He has an innate sense of rhythm and rhythm is very important when it comes to directing. He had a lot of fun on the set. We shot an arrow, and Idir was that arrow, that we so obstinately tried to film. An actor is always a third, fourth, fifth director. Directing is about finding out how to live the inside of a character.\nC\u00e9line Sciamma, winner of the Best Screenplay prize with\u00a0'Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu' (Portrait of a Lady on Fire):\nIt's been an exceptional year. The selection was very good, and the list of winners was just as good. I am delighted to be a part of it. Writing can take years. There is an energy born of loneliness. I try to write emotional journeys. The film had to tell its own story, so that it would become the language of the audience. I wanted to make an impact on the spectators' retinas. Erotic scenes can be very joyful to shoot, it's like making little jokes.\nMENAFN2705201901530000ID1098576038"}, {"text": "We're hearing the term \"quid pro quo\" a lot these days, but in fact we as consumers trade \"something for something\" almost every day.

How Parasite broke 92 years of precedent at the academy awards.\nWelcome back to Early Start. I'm Alison Kosik. Good morning. JARRETT: Good morning, I'm Laura Jarrett, 31 minutes past the hour here in New York. There is a new urgency in Democratic race right now. Struggling candidates are trying to salvage hopes for a comeback facing a critical juncture in tomorrow New Hampshire primary. The latest CNN poll shows a clear top tier, Bernie Sanders leading at 28 percent that's about where he was last month. And Pete Buttigieg making the biggest gains, now at 21 percent. Everybody else including Joe Biden well behind.\nKOSIK: Biden and Sanders forcing the surging Buttigieg to play defense this weekend. First it was Biden, his campaign going negative with an ad in New Hampshire highlighting former Mayor Pete's experience gap.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joe Biden had to leave the passage of the affordable care act which gave health care to 20 million people.

It's the movie that grew so much by word of mouth and a lot of people thought it was a dark horse in this race and then it just shot through. Now, walking away with four academy awards. We caught up with the Director, the screenwriter behind it, Bong Joon-ho, after his win after he came up here to the Governor's Ball. Take a listen to what he said about the win. How are you feeling right now?\nBONG JOON-HO, PARASITE, SCREENWRITER (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): I think we destroyed the barrier too much. We should have taken our time actually.\nJOON-HO: And when he is doing speech -- I hear like this, -- I felt like the Oscar trophy was staring at me so we locked eyes for a second.\nELAM: And that was before the drinking.\nJOON-HO: Yeah, I was sober. Totally sober.\nELAM: On the acting side the wins went pretty much the way Hollywood was expecting. You have Laura Dern winning for best supporting actress for Marriage Story. Renee Zellweger winning best actress for Judy. Brad Pitt, one for Once upon a time in Hollywood. He was the best supporting actor there. And he did get a little political while he was there on stage in his acceptance speech.\nBRAD PITT, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR: They told me I only have 45 seconds up here which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.\n(APPLAUSE)\nELAM: And winning for best actor, as expected, Joaquin Phoenix for Joker. He's been political all award season long. This was no different.\nJOAQUIN PHOENIX, BEST ACTOR, JOKER: I think at times we feel or are made to feel that we champion different causes, but for me I see commonality. I think whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or clear rights or indigenous rights or animal rights we're talking about the fight against injustice. We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.\nELAM: But still while all of the acting categories were pretty much as expected, the big news here is the win for Parasite. Definitely taking home big wins in categories that we weren't so sure. However, we can tell you it also broke history becoming the first foreign language film to win best picture. So, a great night for the Parasite team indeed. Laura and Alison.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nKOSIK: OK, that means I actually have to go see the movie now.\nJARRETT: I know. I know, I'm so behind on all of them.\nKOSIK: All right, the coronavirus may be centered in China, but the effects are far reaching including for the election year in the U.S. Economy.\n[04:40:00]\nJARRETT: The number of coronavirus cases on a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan nearly doubling. There are now 65 new cases of the virus onboard the ship bringing the total to 135. The global death toll has now climbed to 910 surpassing the 2003 SARS outbreak. There's now more than 40,000 cases worldwide. CNN's Matt Rivers on the phone from Yokohama Japan with more. Matt, how surprising is it that the number of cases keeps ticking up even though folks are in quarantine? I mean, they're basically sequestered in their rooms there.\nMATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right, I think -- there's two things going on here. I think on the one hand it's already saying look, it's not the (inaudible) the number of cases go up, because this incubation period for this virus can be up to two weeks. So, even though people have been quarantined they say it's still possible that these people haven't shown symptoms and then they begin to show symptoms, or they test positive.\nThe key thing to take away here from what authorities are saying is they believe that all 66 new cases, and that's an eye popping number. That's why people are quite surprised by how many cases there are, but they believe that all these new cases are people who contracted the virus before this quarantine, this two week quarantine period went into effect.\nSo, they say because of that they believe the quarantine is working, and they are going to keep people in this quarantine. That said, that's a tough pill to swallow for people onboard. Even if they believe what Japanese authorities are saying, which most of the people (inaudible) to do, it's still difficult.\n[04:45:15]\nHowever, some are keeping a good spirit. Here's one couple from Canada we spoke to earlier today.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We still feel good. We still think we're in a good, safe place. We've quarantined ourselves. We're not getting in touch with -- we're not dealing with any other people on a personal basis.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So we've decided not to participate in the walks on deck that the captains arranged for people. We're fortunate we've got the outside cabin with a balcony.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is one of the nicest prisons in the world and here we're going to stay until we ride this out.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nRIVERS: And at least here we have -- there's freedom of speech in Japan. In China where this outbreak has happened there isn't. And there's a good example of that. There's a citizen journalist from Wuhan who had really been doing some critical reporting online talking about what was going on inside of China and it was early and late last week actually that he just disappeared. And it's not uncommon for that to happen in China among citizen journalists. He disappeared. No one knew where he was until family members confirmed that he had been, quote, forced into quarantine by government officials.\nYou would not be mistaken if you believe that is the Chinese government trying to silence its own people trying to talk about what is happening to them. So here in Japan these people can talk about what's going on. In China, not so much.\nJARRETT: that's a great point, Matt. Thank you so much for being there for us. And we want to note the Royal Caribbean Anthem Of The Sea ship, docked in New Jersey since Friday. Well, it will set sail today. Passengers began boarding Sunday after four passengers tested negative for coronavirus.\nKOSIK: A strong economy is central to President Trump's re-election campaign, but the x factor in the election year economy is the coronavirus outbreak. It's hard to know how much the outbreak could affect the U.S. Economy. Goldman Sachs estimates the virus could trim four tenths of a percent from growth in 2020.\nBut uncertainty is already threatening global growth. There is concern about agricultural purchases. Farmers could have to wait longer to see orders for soybeans and corn coming from China. The outbreak has also disrupted the global supply chain. Shipping containers are idling in shipping ports creating uncertainty for American companies that rely on Chinese suppliers. And tourism is taking a huge hit. Airlines including American, United and Delta and others have canceled flights to and from China. And the crisis could shutdown auto plants around the world. Most assembly plants in China are closed. Widespread halt at global auto plants could become more likely if the plant shutdowns continue.\nJARRETT: Another round of evacuations in New South Wales not from wildfires. This time it's flooding. Heavy rain forcing everyone to head for higher ground in several towns along Australia's Southeast Coast. More than 8 inches of rain fell in one 24-hour period in some areas. And over 15 inches have fallen in four days. That's the most in 30 years. Over 50 schools in New South Wales are closed because of the floods.\nKOSIK: Winter storms Ciara causing major travel disruption across Europe. The storm forcing two of Europe's busiest airports in Frankfurt and Amsterdam to each ground more than 100 flights. A number of flights were also affected at Britain's Heathrow airport. Ciara's high winds also helping to break a new record. The fastest ever non- supersonic flight from New York to London. Just 4 hours and 56 minutes compared to the average 6 plus hours. The British airways flight reaching speeds above 800 miles an hour as it rode the Jetstream accelerated by Ciara.\nJARRETT: That's a lot faster.\nKOSIK: Thanks, Ciara.\nJARRETT: Yes.\nKOSIK: They say revenge is a dish best served cold. But how about revenge with a side of fries? CNN Business has the details on Burger King's Valentine's Day promotion next.\n[04:50:00]\nJARRETT: A man from the Tampa area arrested outside the White House after threatening to assassinate President Trump. According to D.C. police, 25-year-old Roger Hedgpeth approached a secret service officer on Saturday and told him he planned to kill the president. He was arrested and a 3.5 inch blade was found on his left hip. Police described Hedgpeth as a quote critically missing endangered person. He's been taken in for a mental health evaluation.\nKOSIK: The watchdog for veteran's affairs is reviewing a request to investigate the V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie. Wilkie is accused of seeking dirt on a Congressional staffer who alleges she was sexually assaulted. The request to investigate Wilkie was made by California Congressman Mark Takano. One of Takano's top aides, Navy Veteran Andrea Goldstein claims she was sexually harassed and assaulted at the V.A. Medical Center in Washington last fall. Once she filed a complaint, the Washington Post reports, Secretary Wilkie began inquiring about her background and encouraging staffers to discredit her.\nJARRETT: A California man arrested for allegedly posing as a ride share driver to lure women into his vehicle, 48 year-old Nassef Ragheb, a Bakersfield, facing burglary, false imprisonment, and attempted sexual battery charges.

Police are asking any other victims who may be out there to come forward.\n[04:55:13]\nKOSIK: The Washington Redskins are reportedly working to hire the first full time black female coach in NFL history. That's according to the athletic. Jennifer King would also become just the fourth full- time female coach in the league. King worked closely with current Redskins coach Ron Rivera when she was an intern with the Carolina Panthers in 2017 and is expected to help out with Washington's offense. She was also an offensive assistant with Dartmouth College this past fall.\nJARRETT: A 16-year-old Texas student withdraws from school after refusing to cut his hair that he's growing out to help his sick sister. Newt Johnson 11-year-old sister and best friend Maggie has Wegener disease, it's a rare auto-immune disease that affects her kidneys. Johnson wants to donate a wig to her someday, but his school handbook says male students can't have hair past their ears. Since he needs eight to 14 inches before he can donate it, Johnson dropped out. The school district says Johnson would have been allowed in class but would have to serve detention. The district also raised $3,000 to help the family with hospital expenses.\nKOSIK: Well, let's get a check on CNN Business this morning. Taking a look at global markets. It's looking like a mixed picture for Asian markets although it looks like they've mostly closed lower. European markets have opened lower and on Wall Street, it's looking like we're going to start a little bit lower when stocks open in a few hours from now.\nOn Friday stocks closed lower despite a strong jobs report. The economy added 225,000 jobs in January. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.6 percent but for the right reasons. More people decided to get into the work force and look for a job. The DOW closed down 277 points as investors continue to worry about how the coronavirus will affect the economy. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ both closed half a percent lower.\nBirds of Prey promotion with Burger King may help it at the box office. The chain is offering free whoppers to heartbroken customers on Valentine's Day. All they have to do is bring in a printed picture of their ex to the restaurant's break up boxes. Burger King says, photos brought in for the promo will be destroyed.\nDon't have a photo, no problem. Customers in New York can also bring in letters, stuffed animals or a piece of clothing in exchange for their free burger. All right, I have a quick story, a stuffed animal did they say? I once broke up with a boyfriend in high school. I had given him like a cat. And we share the same locker and he cut off the cat head and left it in my locker.\nMaybe he's watching right now.

But does this look like a guy who can pull off a cover-up? Trump also railed against public schools calling them failing government schools. OK, but you went to private school and you don't even know where Kansas City is?\nBecause after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Trump mistakenly tweeted congratulations to the State of Kansas despite the fact that the Chiefs are from Kansas City Missouri.

Subscribe to our Watching newsletter, which arrives twice weekly in your inbox.]\nFor Oscar viewers eager to catch up with       \u00a0    Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite,\u201d the first-ever non-English-language film to win Best Picture, the timing could not be better for streaming, because it\u2019s just become available for rental. In fact, save for \u201cLittle Women,\u201d \u201c1917\u201d and \u201cBombshell,\u201d which only won in technical categories, every Oscar winner is currently streaming for a fee in digital media stores or on subscription services, and two of the three shorts are posted for free on YouTube. Bong\u2019s twisty genre hybrid about a con that metastasizes into class warfare should be a priority, but it will be easier than usual to find out if the Academy got it right.\n\u2018Parasite\u2019\nWon for: Best picture, director, original screenplay, international feature\nWhere to watch: Rent it on iTunes,       \u00a0    Amazon,       \u00a0    Vudu,       \u00a0    Google Play and       \u00a0    YouTube.\nAn underclass family infiltrates the home of a much wealthier clan in Bong Joon Ho\u2019s impeccably orchestrated allegory about social inequality, which mixes and matches black comedy, social satire and the white-knuckle tension of a thriller. The less known about the plot, the better, given the escalating series of twists that Bong pulls off as the lives of his characters become more closely intertwined. His willingness to play with different genres and tones will be familiar to fans of his previous work, like \u201cThe Host\u201d and \u201cSnowpiercer,\u201d (see where to stream those here) but rarely have they been more smoothly integrated. \n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Joker\u2019\nWon for: Best actor, original score\nWhere to watch: Rent it on iTunes,       \u00a0    Amazon,       \u00a0    Vudu,       \u00a0    Google Play and       \u00a0    YouTube.\nFilms based on DC Comics have tended to go darker than their Marvel counterparts, but \u201cJoker\u201d goes one step further, dispensing of the standard conflicts between hero and villain in favor of a deeper sociological bent. Anchored by Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s performance as Arthur Fleck, a part-time clown and full-time mope who lives with his ailing mother in Gotham City, the film grafts the urban alienation of Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d onto the origin story of DC\u2019s most famous villain. Where Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker in \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d reflects a broken system, Phoenix\u2019s Joker is the product of it.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Judy\u2019\nWon for: Best actress\nWhere to watch: Rent it on iTunes,       \u00a0    Amazon,       \u00a0    Vudu,       \u00a0    Google Play and       \u00a0    YouTube.\nThe Academy loves a splashy biopic performance, and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger locks into a doozy in Judy Garland, the transcendently gifted singer and actress whose triumphs on stage and screen were darkened by mental health issues and substance abuse. Rather than cover the full scope of her life, \u201cJudy\u201d focuses on her last year, when Garland\u2019s sour reputation in America brings her to London in 1968. There, her efforts to revive her career are undermined by her persistent addiction. Zellweger captures both her vulnerably and her volatility as she struggles to put on one last great show.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\u2019\nWon for: Best supporting actor, production design\nWhere to watch: Rent it on iTunes,       \u00a0    Amazon,       \u00a0    Vudu,       \u00a0    Google Play and       \u00a0    YouTube.\nWhen it was announced that Quentin Tarantino was going to make a film about Charles Manson and the Sharon Tate murders, surely no one expected anything like \u201cOnce Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood,\u201d which builds to that fateful night on Cielo Drive, but approaches it from a side angle. Through the fictional characters of the fading Western star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his faithful stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), Tarantino revivifies Hollywood in the summer of \u201969 and captures its turbulent undercurrents with the sensitivity of a seismograph. Before the inevitable spasms of violence, the film is a bittersweet elegy for the end of an era.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Marriage Story\u2019\nWon for: Best supporting actress\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\nDivorce has colored the life and work of the writer-director Noah Baumbach, and he brings all that experience to bear on \u201cMarriage Story,\u201d a comedy-drama about the agonies and possibilities of uncoupling. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are both superb as a creative couple who cannot come to terms amicably on their own, so they engage in an emotionally and financially costly legal dispute. Baumbach makes an enemy of the process, which brings out the worst in both of them, but even the lawyers have a human dimension, especially Laura Dern as a powerful L.A. attorney who approaches the job with empathy and aggression.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Jojo Rabbit\u2019\nWon for: Best adapted screenplay\nWhere to watch: Buy it on iTunes,       \u00a0    Amazon,       \u00a0    Vudu,       \u00a0    Google Play and       \u00a0    YouTube.\nTurning Adolf Hitler into a little boy\u2019s imaginary friend sounds like an unworkable conceit, but Taika Waititi\u2019s nervy crowd-pleaser treats Der F\u00fchrer as a Beatles-like phenomenon that whipped young people like Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) into a nationalist frenzy. Jojo\u2019s time in a Hitler Youth camp is like watching \u201cMoonrise Kingdom\u201d with Nazis, but Waititi undercuts the absurdity by detailing the boy\u2019s relationship with a Jewish girl his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has hidden behind his bedroom walls. In the battle for his conscience, Hitler proves to be a formidable adversary.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018American Factory\u2019\nWon for: Best documentary\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\nWhen the Chinese glass company Fuyao reopens a Dayton, Ohio factory that once housed General Motors, many former G.M. employees return to the work force with the hope of renewed prosperity and cross-cultural harmony. The filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar are present for that optimistic moment and they stay through the difficulties that follow, as differences in work ethic, employee safety and compensation open up a rift between Chinese management and disgruntled American line workers. The promise and peril of this globalist experiment is evoked through Reichert and Bognar\u2019s compassionate eye.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Toy Story 4\u2019\nWon for: Best animated feature\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Disney Plus.

He\u2019s a charming creation who doubles a signal for the low-stakes ambition of \u201cToy Story 4,\u201d which includes the expected Rube Goldberg set pieces and heartstring-tugging of the previous three, but feels more like a stand-alone adventure. Here Woody and the gang are waylaid at a carnival, where they reunite with Little Bo Peep, but have to face the possibility that life may send them on separate destinies.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Hair Love\u2019\nWon for: Best animated short\nWhere to watch: Stream it on YouTube.\nFrom Kickstarter phenomenon to Oscar winner, \u201cHair Love,\u201d directed by Matthew A. Cherry, Everett Downing Jr. and Bruce W. Smith, is about nothing more than a black father struggling to style his daughter\u2019s seemingly untamable hair. But within that simple premise, played for equal parts whimsy and sentiment, the movie tells a story about black confidence and identity as well as the rewarding hard work of parenthood. Father and daughter don\u2019t say a word to each other. They don\u2019t need to.\n[Read a feature article on the film.]\n\u2018The Neighbor\u2019s Window\u2019\nWon for: Best live-action short\nWhere to watch: Stream it on YouTube.\nAfter three nominations for documentary Oscars \u2014 including one for \u201cStreet Fight,\u201d about a young Cory Booker\u2019s insurgent campaign for mayor of Newark \u2014 the director Marshall Curry finally wins one for a tight piece of short fiction that uses a \u201cRear Window\u201d scenario to reflect on a rocky marriage. Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller star as the beleaguered parents of young children who naturally get jealous when a good-looking, amorous couple moves into the building across the street and doesn\u2019t bother to put up drapes. But that grass-is-greener feeling dissipates as the strangers they\u2019re watching turn out to have more complicated lives than they initially believe.\n[Read the New York Times review of the Oscar nominated shorts.]\n\u2018Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You\u2019re a Girl)\u2019\nWon for: Best documentary short\nWhere to watch: Stream it on Hulu.\nFounded in 2007, the nonprofit organization Skateistan has included skateboarding as part of a larger educational mission to serve disadvantaged children in Afghanistan, South Africa and Cambodia, 50% of them girls. Carol Dysinger\u2019s 40-minute documentary short narrows the focus to Kabul, Afghanistan, where a brutal patriarchy has persisted after the Taliban. Many girls are denied access to schools and face restrictive and often violent conditions at home. At a secure facility, they\u2019re taught how to read and write, but as the title promises, there are skateboarding lessons, too, intended to empower and delight them.\n\u2018Ford v.

Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby, who\u2019s commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to build a car fast enough to defeat the dominant Ferrari fleet at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With the volatile Ken Miles (Bale) as his driver, Carroll and his team of engineers put together a winner through hard work, sweat and a lot of spit and bubble gum.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2018Rocketman\u2019\nWon for: Best Original Song\nWhere to watch: Buy it on iTunes.

Taron Egerton\u2019s robust lead performance is one reason, but classic singles like \u201cSaturday Night\u2019s Alright for Fighting,\u201d \u201cCrocodile Rock\u201d and \u201cYour Song\u201d give it the quality of a jukebox musical.\n[Read the New York Times review.]\nPHOTO: Clockwise from top left, scenes from \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cJoker,\u201d \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJudy.\u201d (PHOTOGRAPH BY Clockwise from top left: Neon; Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros.; Wilson Webb/Netflix; Pathe FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)"}, {"text": "\u2022\tSouth Korean director Bong Joon-ho picked up Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or\n\u2022\tThe film is about a poor family of hustlers who find jobs with a wealthy family\n\u2022\tParasite has received rave reviews and a five-minute standing ovation\n\u2022\tJoon-ho is the first Korean filmmaker to ever win the coveted Palme d'Or\n\u2022\tThe Grand Prize went to director Mati Diop's feature-film debut Atlantics\nSouth Korean director Bong Joon-ho picked up Cannes Film Festival's coveted Palme d'Or award for his social satire Parasite on Saturday night.\nThe film was awarded the festival's top prize, while Quentin Tarantino's latest outing Once Upon A Time In Hollywood was snubbed by the board in all categories.\nJoon-ho's tragicomedy is about a poor family of hustlers who find jobs with a wealthy family, but become embroiled in dark, unexpected and currently unknown incident. \nSimilarly to Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, little has been revealed about the film so that the audience can enjoy it without knowing how the plot will unfurl. \nParasite has received rave reviews ever since it premiered at the glitzy event and received a five-minute standing ovation from the audience.\nIt stars one of Korea's most prolific actors, Song Kang-ho, and Parasite marks the fourth time he's worked with prestigious director Joon-ho. \nJoon-ho is the first Korean filmmaker to ever win the Palme d'Or and also only the second Asian filmmaker be awarded the prize after Hirokazu Koreeda won it last year for his family drama, and Oscar nominee, Shoplifters. \nIn the festival's closing ceremony, jury president Alejandro Inarritu said the choice had been 'unanimous' for the nine-person jury.\nThe genre-mixing film had arguably been celebrated more than others at Cannes this year, hailed by critics as the best yet from the 49-year-old director.\nJoon-ho's previous successes include Netflix hit Okja starring Tilda Swinton, South Korean murder mystery Memoirs Of A Murderer and cult hit Snowpiercer. \nThe decision to allow Netflix films Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories by Noah Baumbach to compete in Cannes in 2017 sparked outrage.\nFilm festival head Thierry Fremaux, 57, said Netflix and other streamers could still screen their movies, but couldn't vie for the top prize, according to an article by The Hollywood Reporter.\nFremaux said he wanted the films by the acclaimed directors to premiere at Cannes instead of going to another festival, but neither one of them won.\n'Last year, when we selected these two films, I thought I could convince Netflix to release them in cinemas. I was presumptuous, they refused,' Fremaux said.\nNetflix tried to secure permits to screen the movies, but ran afoul of France's strict chronology laws surrounding film release. The festival has since changed its rules to require theatrical release in France.\nThe festival's second place award, the Grand Prize, went to French-Senegalese director Mati Diop's feature-film debut, Atlantics. The film by Diop, the first black female director ever in competition in Cannes, views the migrant crisis from the perspective of Senegalese women left behind after many young men flee by sea to Spain.\nAlthough few quibbled with the choice of Bong, some had expected Cannes to make history by giving the Palme to a female filmmaker for just the second time. Celine Sciamma's period romance Portrait of a Lady on Fire was the Palme pick for many critics this year. Instead, Sciamma ended up with best screenplay.\nIn the festival's 72-year history, only Jane Champion has won the prize in 1993 for The Piano, tying with Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine.\nBest actor went to Antonio Banderas for Pedro Almodovar's reflective drama Pain and Glory. In the film, one of the most broadly acclaimed of the festival, Banderas plays a fictionalised version of Almodovar looking back on his life and career.\n'The best is still to come,' said Banderas, accepting the award.\n                     CANNES' FILM FESTIVAL WINNERS                    \n- Palme d'Or: 'Parasite' by Bong Joon-ho (South Korea)\n- Grand Prix: 'Atlantics' by Mati Diop (France)\n- Jury Prize: 'Les Miserables' by Ladj Ly (France) and 'Nighthawk' by Kleber Mendonca Filho (Brazil)\n- Best director: Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (Belgium) for 'Young Ahmed'\n- Best actress: Emily Beecham (Britain) for 'Little Joe'\n- Best actor: Antonio Banderas (Spain) for 'Pain and Glory'\n- Special mention: 'It Must Be Heaven' by Elia Suleiman\n- Best screeplay: 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' by Celine Sciamma (France)\nThe Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, who have already twice won the Palme d'Or, took the best director prize for Young Ahmed, their portrait of Muslim teenager who becomes radicalized by a fundamentalist imam.\nThe jury prize, or third place, was split between two socially conscious thrillers: The French director Ladj Ly's feature-film debut Les Miserables and Brazilian director Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho's Bacurau. \nBritish actress Emily Beecham won best actress for her performance in Jessica Hausner's science-fiction drama Little Joe. The jury also gave a special mention to Palestinian director Elia Suleiman's 'It Must Be Heaven.'\nThe Camera d'Or, an award given for best first feature from across all of Cannes' sections, went to C\u00e9sar D\u00edaz's 'Our Mothers,' a drama about the Guatemalan civil war in the 1980s. \nTarantino, who attended the closing ceremony, didn't go home empty handed. On Friday, a prominent pooch in his film won the annual Palme Dog, an award given by critics to Cannes' best canine."}, {"text": "Bong Joon Ho's Parasite -- winner of this year's Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival -- has gotten a release date with distributor Neon. \nParasite will hit theaters on Oct. 11 in Los Angeles and New York before receiving a platformed release that will expand the film onto more screens. The fall release places the feature, a foreign film frontrunner, in contention for awards season. \nJoon Ho's modern fairy tale received universal praise after its debut, earning a 97 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Hollywood Reporter review says the movie \"packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times.\" \nParasite follows two families -- the wealthy Parks and the street smart Kims -- whose entangled lives are threatened by greed and class prejudices. \nAlso opening on Oct. 11 will be Ang Lee's Gemini Man, starring Will Smith, and Sony's long-awaited Zombieland sequel."}, {"text": "[04:00:00]\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nJOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This guy's not Barack Obama.\nMAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-SOUTH BEND-IN) 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, he's right.

The $ 4.8 trillion plan calls for cuts to nondefense discretionary programs which does not include Medicare or social security.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports the plan does include cuts to mandatory spending programs including $130 billion in changes to Medicare prescription drug pricing, $292 billion in safety net cuts, such as work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps and $70 billion from tightening eligibility access to disability benefits.\nAs a candidate Trump promised to get rid of the national debt, but the proposed budget plan would not eliminate a deficit never mind the debt in the next 10 years. The deficit has ballooned partly because of tax cuts and a two year budget deal that boosted federal spending. Usually budget deficits widen during economic downturns, but the economy is expanding, and unemployment is at a 50-year low.\nJARRETT: The newly minted best picture making history at the Oscars.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Oscar goes to Parasite.\n(APPLAUSE)\n(CHEERS)\nJARRETT: Critical darling Parasite becoming the first non-English language film in the Oscars 92nd year history to win top prize. The show didn't have a host, but there was no shortage of political humor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A couple of years ago there was a big disaster here at the Oscars where they accidently read out the wrong name. And it was nobody's fault but they have guaranteed that this will not happen this year because the academy has switched to the new Iowa caucus act.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nJARRETT: the lack of recognition for women filmmakers came up several times. Past Oscar winner Natalie Portman even wearing a cape that was embroidered with the names of snubbed female directors. But the night belonged to Parasite. CNN's Stephanie Elam has more now from Los Angeles.\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\nSTEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Laura and Alison, this Oscars is all about Parasite. It's the movie that grew so much by word of mouth and a lot of people thought it was a dark horse in this race and then it just shot through. Now, walking away with four academy awards. We caught up with the Director, the screenwriter behind it, Bong Joon-ho, after his win after he came up here to the Governor's Ball. Take a listen to what he said about the win. How are you feeling right now?\nBONG JOON-HO, PARASITE, SCREENWRITER (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): I think we destroyed the barrier too much. We should have taken our time actually.\nJOON-HO: And when he is doing speech -- I hear like this, -- I felt like the Oscar trophy was staring at me so we locked eyes for a second.\nELAM: And that was before the drinking.\nJOON-HO: Yeah, I was sober. Totally sober.\nELAM: On the acting side the wins went pretty much the way Hollywood was expecting. You have Laura Dern winning for best supporting actress for Marriage Story. Renee Zellweger winning best actress for Judy. Brad Pitt, one for Once upon a time in Hollywood. He was the best supporting actor there. And he did get a little political while he was there on stage in his acceptance speech.\nBRAD PITT, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR: They told me I only have 45 seconds up here which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.\n(APPLAUSE)\nELAM: And winning for best actor, as expected, Joaquin Phoenix for Joker. He's been political all award season long. This was no different.\nJOAQUIN PHOENIX, BEST ACTOR, JOKER: I think at times we feel or are made to feel that we champion different causes, but for me I see commonality. I think whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or clear rights or indigenous rights or animal rights we're talking about the fight against injustice. We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.\n[04:10:30]\nELAM: But still while all of the acting categories were pretty much as expected, the big news here is the win for Parasite. Definitely taking home big wins in categories that we weren't so sure. However, we can tell you it also broke history becoming the first foreign language film to win best picture. So, a great night for the Parasite team indeed. Laura and Alison.\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\nJARRETT: Such a big sweep for Parasite. There's great behind the scenes footage of the Director actually apologizing to the engravers for having too many Oscars. It's a great night for him.\nKOSIK: OK. Two U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Another round of violence in an already violent year against Americans.\n[04:15:00]\nKOSIK: The number of coronavirus cases on a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan nearly doubling. There are 66 new cases of the virus onboard the ship bringing the total to 136. The death toll has now climb to 910, surpassing the 2003 SARS outbreak. There's now more than 40,000 cases worldwide.\nCNN's Matt Rivers is live for us in Yokohama, Japan with more. Now, we know that thousands are on this ship, but this jump in the number of people showing that they have the coronavirus, it's a little stunning. What's the reaction you're hearing?\nMATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean that's a good way to put it. You know, we were expecting maybe there to be a slight increase today. You know, in the last couple of days we've seen three new cases, then six new cases, but this news came out this afternoon, 66 new cases. That's nearly a 100 percent increase over the 70 cases which is where we stood yesterday. And so that freaked people out a little bit.\nAnd the question was that's been hanging over all of this, is the virus still being spread onboard the cruise ship even though passengers have been put into a two-week quarantine? What officials are saying though is no. They believe that all 66 of these cases are people that contracted the virus before the quarantined was put into place on Monday.\nSo that quarantine will remain in place for the next 10 days or so because they believe that it is working onboard. Still, this number is scary, and it shows you how quickly this virus can spread. That said, people onboard taking it pretty well. We spoke to a couple from Canada. Rose and Greg, here's what they had to say after today's news.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We still feel good. We still think we're in a good, safe place. We've quarantined ourselves. We're not getting in touch with -- we're not dealing with any other people on a personal basis.\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So we've decided not to participate in the walks on deck that the captains arranged for people. We're fortunate we've got the outside cabin with a balcony.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is one of the nicest prisons in the world and here we're going to stay until we ride this out.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nRIVERS: A really good spirit on those two. Now, they're going to be stuck in quarantine until February 19th, but Alison, really it's just day to day here in Yokohama. Each day people wake up and wonder how many more cases are going to be confirmed today.\nKOSIK: They are definitely good sports. They're giving the old thumbs up. Matt, thanks very much.\nAnd we wanted to note the Royal Caribbean Anthem Of The Sea ship that docked in New Jersey since Friday it will set sail today. Passengers began boarding Sunday after four passengers tested negative for the coronavirus.\nJARRETT: Two U.S. Army Green Berets were killed and six others wounded in an attack on a joint U.S.-Afghan operation over the weekend. The Pentagon on Sunday identified the two sergeants killed as Javier Gutierrez of San Antonio, and Antonio Ray Rodriguez of (Inaudible), New Mexico.\nThe pentagon says the shooter was wearing an Afghan army uniform. The attack is under investigation now. It's the latest in a series of deadly incidents in Afghanistan involving Americans in the last month including an explosive device, a plane crash and an abduction.\nKOSIK: A Congressional staffer reported a sexual assault. Why investigators now want to speak with the secretary of veterans affairs.\n[04:20:00]\nJARRETT: The watchdog for veteran's affairs is reviewing a request to investigate the V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie. Wilkie is accused of seeking dirt on a Congressional staffer who alleges she was sexually assaulted. The request to investigate Wilkie was made by California Congressman Mark Takano. One of Takano's top aides, Navy Veteran Andrea Goldstein claims she was sexually harassed and assaulted at the V.A. Medical Center Washington last fall. Once she filed a complaint, the Washington Post reports, Secretary Wilkie began inquiring about her background and encouraging staffers to discredit her.\nKOSIK: The man who launched two shootings attacks on New York City police officers over the weekend said he did it because he hate cops. Police say the first attack took place Saturday on two officers sitting in a van at the 41st precinct in the Bronx. The second happening the next morning on uniformed officer and a civilian employee inside the precinct.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nDERMONT SHEA, NYPD COMMISIONER: This is not a crime gone bad.

The suspect, 45-year-old Robert Williams is set to be arraigned today.\nJARRETT: A man is under arrest this morning for driving a van through a tent with Trump campaign volunteers in Jacksonville, Florida. Gregory Tim faces charged of aggravated assault, criminal mischief and driving on a suspended driver's license.\n[04:25:00]\nThe Jacksonville sheriff's office say they're still investigating whether the incident was politically motivated. Trump quickly jumped onto Twitter to condemn the attack warning, quote, be careful tough guys with who you play with. No one was injured.\nKOSIK: OK, we all no Bill Nye the science guy, but how about Bill Nye the style guy? Watch the style guy, watch this.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n(MUSIC PLAYING)\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n(LAUGHTER)\nKOSIK: So, if you notice as he's walking, everybody is kind a walking chill, but when they see him getting down to Lizzo, everybody else kind a starts dancing as well. Who knew the popular science explainer had moves. Nye was caught on TikTok, dancing down the runway to Lizzo, during New York fashion week. He was there for the blue jacket fashion show, an event raising awareness for men's health and prostate cancer treatment.\nJARRETT: First of all, I love that he's in fashion week. Look at that jacket. The brocade is gorgeous.\nKOSIK: And look how comfortable he is in his own skin grooving to the music.\nJARRETT: Go ahead Bill Nye.\nWell, time is running out for candidates to gain traction in Democratic race.

Struggling candidates trying to salvage hopes for a comeback, they face a critical juncture in tomorrow's New Hampshire primary.\nThe latest CNN poll shows a clear top tier. Bernie Sanders leading at 28 percent. That's about where he was last month. And, Pete Buttigieg making the biggest gains, now at 21 percent. Everybody else, including Joe Biden, well behind.\nKOSIK: Biden and Sanders forcing the surging Buttigieg to play defense this weekend. First, it was Biden -- his campaign going negative with an ad in New Hampshire highlighting former Mayor Pete's experience gap.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBIDEN POLITICAL AD: Joe Biden helped lead the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which gave health care to 20 million people.

Neither is any of us running for president. And this isn't 2008, it's 2020 and we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nJARRETT: Biden is now looking beyond New Hampshire, focusing squarely on the next contest in Nevada and South Carolina, both with bigger minority voting blocs.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nBIDEN: That I've viewed from the beginning -- and I really mean this -- I've viewed from the beginning that you have to take the first four as one. You've got two primaries and two caucuses back-to-back, basically. And not a single person has won without overwhelming support from the black community -- overwhelming -- overwhelming, OK? So, here --\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nJARRETT: In case you missed it, it's overwhelming.\nBernie Sanders, meantime, beating a familiar drum to go after Buttigieg -- billionaire money and politics.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am running against a candidate -- Pete Buttigieg, among others -- who has raised contributions from more than 40 billionaires.\nBUTTIGIEG: The hundreds of thousands of people who've supported our campaign, some of them have a lot of money. And just as I'm going to expect them to pay more in taxes when I'm president, I invite them to contribute as much as they can if they share our vision for defeating Donald Trump.\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nKOSIK: This week, there's also a lot at stake for Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. Warren came in a disappointing third in Iowa. Klobuchar placing fifth, but she had more support than many had expected. She also had a strong debate performance on Friday.\nPresident Trump wasting no time punishing his enemies in the aftermath of the impeachment trial. His actions undermining claims by Republican senators about the shame of impeachment tempering the president's behavior.\nThe U.S. ambassador to Europe, Gordon Sondland, sent packing. His testimony implicated the president in a direct quid pro quo exchange of favors with Ukraine.\nJARRETT: Lt. Col.

Plus, a congressional staffer reporting a sexual assault. Why investigators want to speak with the secretary of Veterans Affairs.\nKOSIK: Just one day to go until New Hampshire's Democratic primary. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg way ahead in the polls and showing momentum. But, Joe Biden is struggling and he's going negative in a way that could backfire in the long run.\nJARRETT: Joining us to discuss, Princeton University historian and professor Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst as well. Julian, good morning.\nJULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, CO-AUTHOR, \"FAULT LINES: A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES SINCE 1974\": Good morning.\nKOSIK: Good morning.\n[05:40:00]\nJARRETT: Always great to have you on set.\nZELIZER: Thank you.\nJARRETT: So, the New Hampshire primary is shaping up a little bit like Iowa. You've got Buttigieg and Sanders in the top tier right now. Obviously, Sanders ahead in most of the polls. It's almost shaping up to be the moderate millennial against the boomer socialist, self- described Democratic socialist.\nIf Buttigieg comes in a close second tomorrow night in New Hampshire, what does that mean for the race?\nZELIZER: Well, I think the two of them have positioned themselves well and I'm not sure it matters if either of them are slightly in second place. In some ways, the big story is who comes in third and fourth.\nWhat happens to Sen. Warren? Can she deliver in this neighboring state? And does that put her campaign in peril?\nAnd what happens if Joe Biden does poorly again? Everyone's always anticipated his campaign will be about Super Tuesday. But this does shake up fundraisers and deflate organizers.\nKOSIK: Yes.\nAnd speaking of Joe Biden, he's getting some criticism that he's not aggressive enough. So guess what? He's going negative. You look at the ads -- you look at how he's talking to potential voters and being negative.\nWhat risks are there? Does he risk alienating every mid-sized city in America by doing this?\nZELIZER: Well, you can go negative. Politics ain't beanbag, as they say. You have to be tough.\nBut he's always been a little bit of a mystery in terms of what he's about. His claim is he's electable. His claim is he was vice president. So the risk is that it all becomes about the attack and that he never fills out the substance.\nSen. Sanders, we know what he's about. In some ways, we now know what Mayor Pete is about. Biden still has defining to do and that's the risk if it's just attack, attack, attack.\nJARRETT: But was this a good idea right now? I mean, he's kind of described this race as the first four -- you know, that's one bloc and then we'll all move along. But -- I mean, how are people in the Midwest supposed to receive and ad like that and think oh, that's somebody who speaks to me and my issues?\nZELIZER: No, you're right. There is a way to turn off the voter if that's all that they see. And in some ways, Biden's an aspirational candidate in that he's supposed to be politics can be in a better place.\nJARRETT: Yes.\nZELIZER: Politics can be different.\nSo I think some might receive that and say well, he's more of the same and I'm going to go with these other choices who are more defined and who seem to have a little more --\nJARRETT: Sure.\nZELIZER: -- there there in terms of the substance.\nKOSIK: You brought up Elizabeth Warren. Can Elizabeth Warren, can Amy Klobuchar -- can they survive a bad night? Let's say, one of them or both have a bad night in New Hampshire.\nZELIZER: They can survive in that we have a multicandidate process, but I do think it would really hurt Warren. This -- the first two contests were somewhere Warren was expected to do well, like Sanders and Buttigieg. She has not. And I would imagine if she performs really poorly, she's going to be struggling or cutting funds and then that hurts you in the next run.\nKlobuchar, she's staying in this place and waiting for things to break and I think there's space for her to continue doing that.\nJARRETT: Yes. Before we let you go, I want to get your thoughts on the president firing Ambassador Gordon Sondland and also Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. We saw that over the weekend.\nAnd it's not just them. I mean, if you look at this map here you can see there are eight different officials -- career diplomats who have either been forced out or who have essentially retired and decided they're getting out of this.\nI mean, what do you -- what do you make of this and this retaliatory firing? I mean, that's what it is. These are people who spoke out against the president in testimony and are now out of a job.\nZELIZER: It's a purge and this is what President Trump does. He's very vindictive. He's very uncomfortable with any disloyal around him and he goes after anyone who has gone after him.\nSo if you're in his inner circle, this is what's happening. He's trying to clear out his Oval Office.\nBut it's a dangerous message to people who are open to testifying, who are open to being honest about what's going on or what's going wrong. This sends a message there's no room for that in the White House.\nJARRETT: Yes, and it makes you wonder -- I mean, what career folks who are still at the State Department are supposed to think about all of this.\nZELIZER: No, it's a totally politicized environment.\nJARRETT: Yes.\nJulian, it's always good to see you.\nZELIZER: Thank you.\nKOSIK: Thanks for joining us.\nJARRETT: Thank you so much.\nKOSIK: And the newly-minted best picture is making history at the Oscars.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\nFONDA: And the Oscar goes to \"Parasite.\"\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\nKOSIK: Critical darling \"Parasite\" becoming the first non-English language film in Oscar's 92-year history to win the top prize.\nThe show did not have a host but there was no shortage of political humor.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE MARTIN, ACTOR-COMEDIAN: A couple of years ago there was a big disaster here at the Oscars where they accidentally read out the wrong name, and it was nobody's fault.

There are now 65 new cases of the virus onboard the ship, bringing the total to 135.\nThe global death toll has now climbed to 910. That surpasses the 2003 SARS outbreak. There's now more than 40,000 cases worldwide.\nCNN's Will Ripley live in Tokyo outside a hospital where an American woman from the ship is being treated. So, Will, break this down for us. If you have any indication that you have the virus, even if you don't have symptoms, you're off the ship.\nWILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. In fact, we have pictures from the ship where you can see a very large -- the largest we've seen, so far -- a line of ambulances that have been taking people off the ship because they're being taken to hospitals like this one. There are hospitals across Japan that are being used to treat coronavirus patients. This is just one of them.\nIn fact, we just saw an ambulance a few minutes ago pass by. The lights were off. It was kind of quietly moving in as not to disturbed this residential neighborhood that the hospital sits next to, but the people who were driving it were in full hazmat protective gear. So we know that that was an ambulance with coronavirus patients most likely taken from the cruise ship because it looks just like all of the other ones that we've seen rolling away from the ship.\nBut, yes, if you have no symptoms, if you have a minor case, you're still in quarantine because they just know so little about coronavirus and there is no, at this point, necessarily effective treatment for it other than the individual body's own immune system. They're not taking any chances.\nBut for the vast majority of patients, this is not a death sentence when you get a diagnosis. It's basically -- you know, we spoke with an American woman, Rebecca Fraysure, who's in the hospital here. She doesn't even have any symptoms. She's not getting any medication or treatment for the coronavirus.\nSo, to try to dial back some of the panic that can ensue from these rapidly rising numbers, the captains -- the ship's captain actually saying that this is not unexpected. All of these people were actually exposed before the quarantine period began.\nChina is doing everything it can to censor information that's coming out about this.\nWe know that a citizen journalist who had been posting videos from inside Wuhan, kind of exposing what he claimed was the city's lack of preparation and lack of equipment to handle what's happening there. Obviously, the vast majority of deaths have been in Wuhan. He has now disappeared. His family believes the Chinese government put him in forced quarantine and they're very worried about his safety, Laura.\nJARRETT: (audio gap) what happened to him there.\nWill, thanks so much for being there for us.

If you would like to see excellent worthy articles on this subject, please consult this link on why the win is significant for the global film industry and this link on the singular beauty of the film itself (written before it was awarded Best Picture).\n\"Parasite,\" like most great works of art, is infused with rivets of meaning. It is not designed for mass appeal. It is not a comfortable film. That is why it deserves our attention and respect.\nOur world is heaving under the mangles of capitalism, violence and hatred. It is a world of winners and losers. Of popularity. Consumerism. Endless founts of student debt.\nThe key to conquering this world is usually money. To get money, you must dive headlong into the throes of capitalism-the white man's world.\nThe patriarchy of success is evident. It is built of thick bricks and cement and a slow-moving poison that worms its way into our books, TV shows, movies and music.\nI am, as a white girl, very tired of seeing stories about white people.\nI do not care if they are well done. I do not care if Greta Gerwig directed the film, if the acting was perfection itself, if the soundtrack was dreamlike and homey. Please, get off the stage for now.\nThis is not to say the white woman's plight is of no significance to me. I earnestly believe in the significance of every voice, every story, on this earth. But the white woman's plight, and the white plight in general, has long dominated the popular audience.\nLet's make room for diverse stories, new stories. Stories that are not about the world we have always known and worshiped. Stories that do not end with the girl kissing the boy.\nThe beauty of storytelling and artistry is that every story uncovers its own gold. We tell stories because of their meanings, the stories within the stories. We tell stories to draw a spotlight to something that has perhaps been hiding in the shadows for far too long.\nThe singular beauty of \"Parasite\" lies in its autonomy. It weaves themes of class conflict, greed, desire, selfishness and culture together in carefully constructed scenes. It does not apologize for them.\nThese stories deserve their places in our midst.\nThe world of subtitles, countries that are not America (yes, other countries do exist) and people who are not Caucasian are the players we have shoved to the side in favor of more Brad Pitt movies and stories about white women feeling trapped into marriages.\nThere is an entire world out there. Do not wait for the Oscars' stamp of approval to go find it."}, {"text": "[summary]\u2002From \"Parasite\" to \"Minari,\" South Korean films, songs and series broke through borders and won audiences and awards around the world during the pandemic. Motivated by this strength, reporter tells of his immersion in the cultural life of the country and the experience of learning Korean in quarantine.\n      \nAt the beginning of last year, the prospects of a sweeping \"Parasite\" oscar win were similar to that of me learning to speak Korean -it would be cool if it happened, but unlikely. A Korean film had never received an award nomination before, and the favorite of that edition was the war epic \"1917\". However, Bong Joon-ho came out with four trophies, including best picture and director.\nLittle has remained the same in the world since then. Declared a month after the awards, the Covid-19 pandemic stopped everything: globo soap operas, the Olympics, dreams of traveling on vacation. However, south Korea's cultural industry has not been slowed down, which has only been celebrating since last year.\nThe ball of the time are the six nominations of \"Minari\" to the Oscars. Although the film is American-its director, Lee Isaac Chung, born in the United States, the son of immigrants-is almost all spoken in Korean.\nFor the film, Steven Yeun and Youn Yuh-Jung compete, respectively, for best actor and supporting actress, an unheard-of fact for artists of Asian origin at the awards. Youn is also the favorite, having won the award of the actors' union in the USA and the Bafta, the English Oscar.\nIn film, TV and music, last year Korea has not stopped pasting stickers on its album of exploits: first Grammy nomination, with the band BTS; first Korean song to reach the top of the Billboard chart, with \"Dynamite\", sung in English by BTS; first song to reach the top of the Billboard chart sung in Korean, with \"Life Goes On\", by the same group.\nThe list of records is also great: according to ifpi (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry), BTS was the world sales champion in 2020. What about the best-selling record? \"Map of the Soul: 7\", also of them. Last Monday (12), \"Dynamite\" reached 1 billion views on YouTube, the third time a video of the group reaches this mark.\nThis cultural strength was key to another unlikely event a year ago: I decided to learn Korean. Social isolation seemed like a unique opportunity to do something unthinkable under normal circumstances-to study a language that did not adopt the Latin alphabet.\nUntil then, almost nothing knew about South Korea. For years I thought k-pop was just a network of fried chicken restaurants in S\u00e3o Paulo, not the famous one, as I discovered later, Korean pop music genre. The scale swung into the language, however, because of \"Parasite\". Although he didn't see opportunities to use the language in practice, he could take advantage of quarantine to see other Bong Joon-ho films.\nStudying the language only with the help of the internet over the last year has proved, at the same time, a much more difficult and much easier endeacity than I imagined.\nOn the one hand, if learning English is like starting to ride a bike, learning Korean is being able to piroulate on a bicicross circuit. While the prayers in Portuguese are formed by subject, verb and object, in Korean the object comes before, the verb at the end and the subject often does not even give the faces.\nOn the other hand, I have noticed that Korea has not been standing out in the cultural scene for nothing. The offer of content in the language is immense, and the country's production scheme seems to have been thought for export.\nThis is particularly clear in the k-pop industry. In many ways, Korean boybands and girlbands are very fond of Western ones. The groups have members of complementary personalities, present elaborate choreographies, and the releases of records are accompanied by visual changes.\nOne important difference, however, is the level of accessibility and the amount of content. While American stars such as Beyonc\u00e9 seem almost unattainable, Korean artists share with fans the minutiae of their work processes and their lives, albeit with a lot of curatorship.\nIn the first season of the pandemic, when staying at home was still new, musicians like Chris Martin and John Legend made lives to entertain their fans. Watching these broadcasts gave the impression that, yes, stars are like us, and we had a sense of community in the midst of isolation.\nIn Korea, this power of rapprochement of lives has long been used. V Live allows celebrities to create channels to make live streams, responding to real-time comments. The biggest one, as you can imagine, is BTS, with more than 27 million subscribers who see the band members playing guitar, having lunch or simply doing nothing.\nEach anniversary of the singers is celebrated in front of the cameras, each achievement is celebrated with fans. Thus, the audience gets the feeling that they know rm, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook, the band members. And it's a huge audience: in March, a live of Jungkook had over 22 million simultaneous views.\nTo reach international visitors, V Live also provides subtitles in more than ten languages, including Portuguese and Korean itself, making it a great ally of the language student.\nOne of the great difficulties in studying the language on your own is the lack of conversation-talking to the dog in Korean was my only alternative, but the advance was nil. Audios made for students, in turn, are artificial, and not all Korean productions on Netflix come with the option of language subtitles.\nThe lives were the outlet and proved to be a powerful entry drug for k-pop addiction. In a few months I went from \"what is BTS?\" to \"one of them is allergic to potatoes\". Jumping from lives to other content was easy, as Korean artists continued to produce during the pandemic, as if nothing had changed.\nPart of this is due to the fact that, although vaccination there is also delayed, Korea faced Covid-19 faster than the rest of the world in general, conducting mass tests from the beginning. Thus, it allowed artists to work even in the sharpest periods of the pandemic in the world.\nAnother determining factor was the adaptability. Each year, for example, the BAND BTS records a reality tour in a different country. As now it was no longer possible, they filmed the isolated singers in the field and released the series \"In the Soop\". Recordings of a tour became a film and, since they could not perform in person at the Grammys, they replicated in Seoul the theater in which the award was awarded.\nIn addition, k-pop took the shows to the computer. And not in a stool and guitar scheme: without being able to do a world tour, the female band Blackpink promoted in January a large-scale virtual presentation, with multiple costume changes and pyrotechnics.\nSame thing did the BTS. To see one of his virtual shows, with simultaneous translation, 756,000 fans from more than 100 countries bought tickets starting at US$26.\nUsing these tools, Korea has managed to circumvent obstacles faced by artists who do not speak English in the pursuit of global success. American radio stations are still reluctant to play k-pop, which seemed to be an insurmountable barrier for the genre to reach the top of the Billboard chart. The fan downloads are so many, though, that BTS has succeeded.\nThis success did not go unnoticed by the Western entertainment industry. From one year to now, it is common to see k-pop stars on American television shows or doing collaborations with artists in the country.\nIn 2020, the Blackpink quartet recorded \"Sour Candy\" with Lady Gaga and \"Ice Cream\" with Selena Gomez. One of the group's singers, Ros\u00e9, also became this year the first Korean artist to perform alone on Jimmy Kimmel's traditional American talk show.\nAnd there are deeper cooperations between Korea and the United States underway. In February, Korean entertainment conglomerate HYBE, responsible for BTS, announced a partnership with Universal Music to \"rewrite the history of world music.\"\nTogether, companies will create a boyband with selected members at global auditions. While Americans will be responsible for music production, marketing and distribution, Koreans will be given the selection and training of singers, as well as the production of content for fans.\nThis month, HYBE also acquired the company Ithaca Holdings, which manages the careers of the likes of Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato. Bang Si-Hyuk, founder of HYBE, said companies willwork together to \"transcend borders and break cultural barriers.\"\nScooter Braun, leader of Ithaca Holdings and one of the most influential names in The American industry, added: \"Global opportunities for artists will grow exponentially with this partnership. It's an opportunity for us to make history, innovate even more in the music industry and revolutionize the game.\"\nSimilar movement takes place in the audiovisual. According to CNN, Netflix will nearly double its budget for producing original content in Asia, especially in Korea. The platform doesn't reveal audience numbers, but South Korean series like \"Itaewon Class,\" \"Kingdom,\" \"All Right Not To Be Normal,\" as well as bombing on Twitter, have won rave reviews in the U.S. media -the latter two were cited by The New York Times among the best international series of 2020.\nLast year, Netflix also began a partnership with Korean media company JTBC and producer Studio Dragon for distribution and co-production of series.\nOn Apple TV, it is in pre-production \"Pachinko\", a book-based series of the same name that tells the saga of a Korean family for generations. With international cast, it will be spoken in Korean, English and Japanese.\nSince there is no release date yet, I can dream that, until then, I will understand about 70% of the dialogues. Learning Korean -or at least starting with-was a roller coaster that accompanied the pandemic. In the first few weeks, when staying at home it seemed like something out of this world, but fleeting, it was reasonably simple.\nSeveral sites teach the alphabet, consisting of 21 vowels and 19 consonants, and on YouTube you can learn to emit the sounds that do not exist in the Portuguese language -in Korean there are no sounds of F or V, but there are many others that we do not do (it is easy, for example, to say \"defecate\" instead of \"buy\", which makes it difficult to acquire pants).\nThe following months of learning grammar were an escalation. For six months, studying one hour a day, nine levels of the wonderful (and free, basic) course on the Talk To Me In Korean website were completed-a total of 270 lessons.\nThere was also the period of the decoreba, in which daily he recorded in a slate six new words and recorded the memorized in an application. At night, he recited verbs until he got to sleep.\nWithout the series, the music and the movies, however, it would have been impossible. From them I learned that in Korea, you don't have your birthday, but on New Year's Eve, and that everyone is born a year old-so there you are one or two years older than here. I also found that it is common for couples with children to call themselves \"So-and-So's father\" or \"Sicrano's mother\", rather than using their own names. That made it easier.\nKorea is well known to the potential of its culture to popularize the country around the world. HYBE, for example, has launched with other institutions the Learn Korean course with BTS, which uses group videos to teach the language at international universities.\nThis wave also caused internal changes in the country. In December, a law was passed that allows popstars to delay their military enlistment by two years, mandatorily complied with by all men up to the age of 28 -age of the oldest member of BTS, Jin.\nDespite recent achievements, however, the Korean cultural wave has challenges ahead. Blackpink fans, for example, were disappointed not to see the band on the list of nominees for the Grammy reveal, although the quartet sets a record after record.\nThe barrier of subtitles, cited by filmmaker Bong Joon-ho in one of his awards speeches for \"Parasite\" last year, also persists. Even \"Minari\" was affected: United States production and story about the American dream, could not compete as best drama film at the Golden Globes.\nSpeaking in Korean, it was embedded in the foreign film category, causing discussion on the internet, since feature films such as \"Babel\" and \"Ingl\u00f3rio bastards\" also contained dialogues in more than one language and disputed the main categories.\nOn Oscar Sunday, the 25th, I'll be, like a year ago, rooting for Korea. The chance of another big win may be minimal, but if we've learned anything in the last year it's that the unlikely often happens. With the Covid-19, it seems that everything repeats itself as tragedy and as a farce, but there are also some small gains.\nIf the latest results are indicative of what Korea can do in the future, I may have more opportunities than I thought to put into practice the language learned. In the end, Korean culture and language have been a good mental escape valve for the past 12 months, but I hope that next time I can learn a new language without going through a pandemic."}, {"text": "Star Rating: 4 stars\nThere's a moment in Terry Zwigoff's 1994 documentary about R      \u00a0    obert Crumb when the cartoonist leans over his teenage son, tweaks the colour on TV so the film he's watching becomes black and white, and says: \"There! Isn't that better?\"\nMaybe. Audiences might be wary of special black and white presentations of new movies. Bong Joon-ho's award-winning Parasite is now getting this treatment, which in 2016 was also conferred on Mad Max: Fury Road with a \"black and chrome\" edition.\nIs this \"luxury arthouse\" monochrome experience a genuine way of enhancing or adding to the film? Or merely a snob marketing ploy, gouging repeat box-office business from an existing fanbase on the fallacious assumption that black and white is somehow classier and more artistic than colour? Would anyone for example, dare offer a colourised version of a new black-and-white movie? Roger Deakins shot the Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There on colour film stock and then corrected it to black and white. Perhaps it is possible to show that in colour. But would it find favour on the same basis? I remember the old colourisation debate from the 1970s, when my parents' old black and white TV was incidentally offering a connoisseur's monochrome presentation of The Wizard Of Oz and also of BBC Two's Pot Black, with the snooker balls in exquisitely nuanced gunmetal shades.\nIt does have to be said that there is a real fascination in seeing Parasite through the monochrome lens, and it has a certain crystalline beauty - but then it did in colour. It's invigorating to see this tremendous film again on any basis, in a way that goes some way to restoring the shock of the new. At the Berlin film festival last month, an industry executive asked me if I thought black and white would help Parasite's CGI effects. After a short pause, she had to break it to me that those fierce colours in the garden were not entirely natural and nobody was falling down the cellar stairs for real.\nSo here we are again, with the cheeky Fagin-style charlatan family - loafer dad (Song Kang-ho), grumpy mum (Chang Hyae-jin), moody teen son (Choi Woo-sik) and smart daughter (Park So-dam) - living in a squalid semi-basement flat and sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich. When the son is engaged as a tutor for a rich kid (Jung Ji-so) from a privileged family who live in a colossal modernist house in the posh part of town, he sees how he can get his entire clan employed there too, pretending to be unrelated strangers. The daughter gets to tutor the kid brother (Jung Hyun-jun) in art, the mum ousts the existing housekeeper and the dad takes over the driver's job. And all the time, the na\u00efve mistress of the house (Cho Yeo-chong) and her overworked husband Mr Park (Lee Syun-kun) get the wool pulled over their eyes, until everyone realises that another terrifying trick is being played on all of them.\nBong has said the advantage of black and white is that it allows the performances to come across more strongly. For me, that isn't quite it. The performances came across quite superbly enough in colour - the monochrome advantages and disadvantages lie elsewhere. In the opening section of the film, seeing the family's scuzzy and ineffably yucky flat in black-and-white gives it an intriguingly kitchen-sinky, Brit social-realist look that it didn't have before, especially when the son and daughter hunch together over that nasty lavatory that is raised on to the flat's chaotic \"mezzanine\" level. And when the whole place is submerged in smoke from the fumigation official, the resulting fog is hilariously stylised, as if Nosferatu is going to emerge from the mist.\nAnd in fact, when all their con-trick shenanigans start to kick off in earnest, the black-and-white Parasite emphasises another Brit dimension that I'd only vaguely sensed from the original: an Ealing comedy.\nIt's when the action moves to the wealthy household that things become less satisfying. We don't see the house's magnificent d      \u00a0    ecor in all its richness and out in the garden, the vivid blue of the sky and rich green of the grass are no longer. When violence erupts, the splashes of blood are less overtly shocking in grey. (But then this is why Scorsese preferred       \u00a0    Raging Bull in black and white.)\nYet it is too reductive to say that only the \"lower-class\" parts of Parasite are better in black and white. Monochrome gives something very elegant to the Park family's illuminated glass crockery cabinets positioned either side of the cellar door, replaced later with wine bottles and glasses. And there is something very queasy and dreamlike in seeing the final bloodbath in black and white. It's a different sort of queasiness and dreaminess than the colour version ... but not necessarily better.\nThere is something very startling about this specialist monochrome-flavour version of Parasite. It gave me a renewed appetite to watch the film all over again. In colour.\nParasite: Black & White Version screens on 5 March at the Glasgow film festival, and is released in the UK on 3 April"}, {"text": "Joseph Han\nIn every country, there's poverty. But wherever there's poverty, wealth can be found nearby. Sometimes, this wealth can be found only as a dream in the minds of the poor; sometimes, it can literally be seen down the block in a stunning luxury mansion with a lovely lawn of green grass. In Bong Joon-ho's gripping, powerful new film, \"Parasite,\" wealth is found in both places.\n\"Parasite,\" set in South Korea, tells the story of the impoverished Kim family. Father, mother, son and daughter live together in a dingy, cramped basement apartment, pilfering their neighbor's wifi, struggling to make ends meet and constantly searching for a new way to make money while relying on their filial bonds to sustain them. Their golden ticket to prosperity falls in the hands of son Kim Ki-woo (Choi woo-sik), who lands a job tutoring for the daughter of the affluent Park family.\nThe Parks - a family with a businessman father, housewife mother, teenage daughter and rambunctious son - live in the aforementioned luxury mansion, a stunning piece of modern architecture with a lovely yard. As Ki-woo gets into the family's good graces, he cunningly finds jobs for his father, mother and sister in the Park household, although the wealthy family has no idea they're all related. The families develop a symbiotic relationship: the Kims have found a steady stream of income, a way out of poverty and the Parks have all their needs - cooking, cleaning, driving, etc. - taken care of in the way that only an extravagantly rich family can.\nBut this isn't a happy movie or a rags-to-riches story. This is a Bong Joon-ho movie. His 2013 film, \"Snowpiercer,\" tackles class struggles by adding a whole lot of violence and conflict to a fantasy world, and \"Parasite\" does it by adding suspense and horror to the real world. The film takes a turn in the third act too good to spoil in a review - you'll have to watch this one yourself. The final act is as gruesome as it is crushing, a fitting end to the roller coaster ride of emotion that is the second half of the film.\n\"Parasite\" lies somewhere between drama and horror; there's one genuinely creepy scene that'll be giving me nightmares for a while, but an overall lack of jump scares and monsters in the dark. It doesn't have the pure terror of \"Hereditary\" or a twist as totally wild as \"Get Out.\" Still, \"Parasite\" ramps up the suspense in a few key moments while letting the overarching question - Can the Kims maintain their relationship with and hide their secret from the Parks to escape poverty? - inject the whole film with a feeling of anxiety. It's gripping from beginning to end, all while delivering a powerful message on timely social issues like poverty, class resentment and wealth inequality.\n\"Parasite\" was a huge hit in South Korea and has received acclaim at film festivals worldwide, winning the Palme d'Or, the highest award at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. It debuts in theaters across the U.S. on Oct. 31 - it's a good Halloween flick - and will likely be in contention for an Academy Award in February. If you want to stay in-the-know when it comes to trendy films in 2019 and also just see a great movie, you should definitely watch \"Parasite.\"\u00a0\nTitle: \"Parasite\"\nStarring: Choi Woo-sik, Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\u00a0\nGenre: Drama/Thriller\nIf you like: \"Get Out,\" \"Snowpiercer,\" \"Midsommar\"\nShamrocks: 4.5 out of 5\nTags: 'Get Out', Bong Joon-ho, Cannes, Hereditary, horror, Midsommar, movie, Oscars, parasite, poverty, snowpiercer, thriller"}, {"text": "Movie: \"Parasite\"\nRelease Date: Nov. 8, 2019\nDirector: Bong Joon-Ho\nRuntime: 2 hours 12 minutes\nGenre: Comedy, crime, drama\nRating: A+\nIn the past, foreign films have completely evaded mainstream culture and appreciation. This year, however, the film \"Parasite\" has received immense critical acclaim. The first-ever foreign film to win a Screen Actors Guild award, it has clearly reached a broader audience.\n\"Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,\" Bong Joon-Ho, the director of \"Parasite,\" said when he accepted the award for his film.\nFor most, the thought of watching a film that is not only in a foreign language but also comprised of almost entirely foreign composition is understandably daunting. However, if approached with an open mind, this confusion will turn into appreciation for Joon-Ho's story. An attitude of enthusiasm and attentiveness will succeed in both evoking emotions and telling an important story of humanity, class, love and wealth.\nIt is not a classic story of action or adventure, but it is an artistic piece that comments on human struggle through its characters. Joon-Ho's subtle and direct choices for the settings, the haunting imagery and the compelling and relatable dialogue are all so captivating.\nThe complex characters that are simultaneously deceptive thieves and lovable humans suffer the injustices of everyday people. The story reveals aspects of humanity like disgust, annoyance, pity and love through these characters.\nAll the components of this film, even in their total estrangement, are still accessibly human because of how interesting the development of the story is. Similar to movies like \"Snowpiercer\" or \"Okja,\" this film remains colorful and complex while also portraying simple themes of humanity and simultaneously a story of the darker sides of the world. The camera angles, the subtleties in dialogue, the coloring of the shots, the symmetry and geometry of the scenery create something of an intensely human thriller full of gritty components and beautiful coloring.\nOnce the viewer accepts the South Korean influence and begins to identify with the story, it becomes a beautiful human tale of deep, thematic traits and is representative of the common struggles of peoples in all areas of the world. The experience is more than worthy to view this uniquely painted essay on humanity shown through dirty characters and a colorfully bloody film."}, {"text": "Story: A poor, unemployed family play out a well-laid plan to secure jobs for themselves in a wealthy household, only to unleash a series of unexpected events.  Review: 'Parasite's' opening shot of a small glass window looking up from a basement house to the view of a narrow winding road, sets the visual language of the film firmly, right at the onset. There are many more such shots which metaphorically convey the social and economic disparity that is the central theme of this film. Especially the use of stairs going up and down, cramped spaces versus lush, open green lawns, delectably and elegantly laid out fruit slices as opposed to a heaped plate of an assortment of food from a local kitchen. \nKim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family live in a pokey, underground house and are generally unemployed. When we meet them, the family is perturbed that their access to free wifi has been cut short. Obviously not able to afford their own, they have been sponging off their neighbor's connection. In fact, even as a fumigation carried out on their street, Kim tells his family to leave the windows open so they can have a free extermination of the insects in their house, despite almost choking on the fumes. On some days, they get by with temporary jobs like fixing pizza boxes. So when his son Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is offered by a friend to be set up as an English tutor to the daughter of a wealthy Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), he agrees. Only hitch, Kim Ki-woo doesn't have a college degree having failed his university exams. But his sister, Kim Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) presents a quick solution to this with her expert artistic and photo-shopping skills. Armed with a forged degree document, Kim makes an easy impression on Mr.Park's wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) and their teenage daughter, Park Da-hye (Jung ji-so). There's also their nine-year-old son, Park Da-song (Jung Hyeong), scampering around the house, who Yeon-kyo believes has untapped artistic talents. With one foot firmly inside the Park household, Kim Ki-jeong craftily places his sister as Da-song's art teacher cum therapist. Yeon-kyo is naivety and gullible nature makes this inclusion quite smooth. Soon with some careful scheming, fake identities and a well-rehearsed plan even his parents, Kim Ki-taek and Chung sook (Chang Hyae-jin) are employed in the household.  It seems like a flawless plan with the Kim family settled into their new found roles and the sunlit, lavish mansion of the Park's giving the perfect backdrop. But just like that, director Bong Joon-ho's screenplay springs upon us unexpected plot twists and a thrilling run up to a grisly yet astounding climax. Through a well-crafted maze of events the prevalent class conflict and social disparity come to the fore. The Kim's are often shown huddled together as a family, gobbling away at their meals and the Park's are often in their own expansive rooms, almost isolated from each other. In a telling scene, when Mr. Park discusses Mr.Kim's smell that wafts through the car when he drives, 'crossing the line' and reaching the backseat, he describes it as an 'old rag that has been boiled' and 'that smell that people who travel in the subway have'. It's evident there is unspoken disdain is on both ends, as Chung sook quips how Yeon-kyo is 'nice because she is rich.' With not a moment that seems unnecessary or extra, 'Parasite' is exceptionally well-paced and edited (Yang Jin-mo). Director Bong Jon-ho is in complete command as he masterfully constructs stylized, dramatic sequences set to a brilliant background score (Jung Jae-il). The ensemble cast enhance the proceedings with superlative performances, especially Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik.  With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch.

But it's entirely distinctive on its own (bizarre) terms: a film about animal cruelty (loosely inspired by the 19th-century children's novel A Dog of Flanders by Marie Louise de la Ram\u00e9e, perennially popular in Korea) and it begins with a huge \"no animals were harmed\" disclaimer. As well it might. The various moments of dog-jeopardy and dog-distress will have you hiding under your seat - and a certain dog rescue scene is like something out of The Shining.\nLee Sung-jae plays Yun-ju, a hapless postgrad student with a pregnant partner. The pair live in a crumbling apartment building whose front doors open outwards - which is to be important in one chase scene. Yun-ju's worries are compounded when he realises that he is expected to pay a hefty bribe to the elderly faculty professor to get a tenure-track job.\nThe combination of financial anxiety and disillusionment triggers a mental breakdown and he becomes obsessed with a dog in a neighbouring flat whose incessant barking is driving him mad. He decides he has no choice but to kill the unfortunate animal. In fact, his misdeeds are to involve three dogs and bring him into fateful contact with an administrator called Hyun-nam (Bae Doona) who has to press an official stamp on all \"Lost Dog\" notices. The movie is by turns wacky, farcical and grimly realist. The dogs might bark, but the ones doing the biting are the humans: the lazy, venal, corrupt, depressed, greedy people who have no one but themselves to blame for living a dog's life. \n\u2022\tBarking Dogs Never Bite is available online through Curzon Home Cinema from Friday, and screens on Saturday at Camden Market in London."}, {"text": "Lights dimmed in movie theatres across the globe late last year as rooms were lit up by Bong Joon-ho's most critically acclaimed film, \"Parasite,\" with the first shot panning down to the initial glimpse of the Kim family's home. Little did viewers know the ingeniously crafted social satire was to become an award-winning motion picture.\u00a0\u00a0\nThank you, @TheAcademy#Oscars #PARASITE pic.twitter.com/eeUZ6zBGz4\n- Parasite (@ParasiteMovie) February 10, 2020\nThe smell of the film's success is something that movie fanatics are unfamiliar with, considering that it was written and filmed in Korean. But, unlike the Park family's reaction to the Kim kin's odor - a theme that proved to be definitive in later parts of the story - the South Korean film was unapologetically celebrated in all of its glory.\u00a0\nWith the rising recognition of foreign films in American culture, accompanied by a leap toward overcoming the English-speaking community's fear of subtitles, \"Parasite\" swept four Oscars on Sunday night, on top of being recognized with hundreds of other awards and nominations.\u00a0\nTo put the cherry on top, \"Parasite\" also made history by being the first non-English film to receive the Best Picture title in the Academy Awards' 92-year run.\u00a0\nThe movie has even been approved by the strict critics of Rotten Tomatoes, as it currently has a 99% rating on the Tomatometer. Clearly, they can recognize the real deal when it's in front of them, a skill the Park family lacked when welcoming their newest recruits into their home.\n\"Parasite\" exists as a comment on classism, following the Kims' penetration into a wealthy, yet clueless, household. Money can indeed buy comfort, but the Parks outdid themselves by falling host to the impoverished family.\nKim Ki-woo, played by Woo-sik Choi, was the first to infiltrate the Park's modernistic home, previously built and inhabited by the infamous fictional architect Namgoong Hyeonja. Ki-woo lucked out in having the connection that he did, because if it wasn't for his friend, Min, played by Seo-joon Park, Ki-woo would not have experienced the luxury of living above ground.\u00a0\nAs Ki-woo and his family scheme to get each member a job under the Parks' roof, their actions become more twisted and their morals less clear. With each con the Kims pull off, viewers begin to question where to draw the line between right and wrong, and Ki-woo begins to lose his grasp of reality as he fantasizes about having Min's life.\u00a0\nThough Min's role was minimal, it was far from insignificant. Min is the catalyst for the Kims' connection to the Parks, as well as the figure of economic prestige that Ki-woo aspires to be. Even toward the end of the film, audiences can juxtapose the stark contrast between Min, an affluent university student, to Ki-woo, a wasted talent with the mind, but not the money, to climb out of his family's lower-class status.\u00a0\nKi-woo's hopes that his family will one day live upstairs are the figurative insect blocking his better judgment, and completely deplete him of his ethical compass. But, a parasite can only survive as long as its host remains healthy; that biological concept stands within nature as much as it does in class warfare. As Ki-woo falls into a downward spiral, his parasitic thoughts consequently follow suit.\nJoon-ho does an immaculate job blending elements of comedy, crime, drama and horror into the film. He does it so well that the audience does not realize the damage that has been done until the Kims come face to face with the initial parasites of the Namgoong home. In an effort to protect their family's recent employment, occupations that are as sturdy as the lies they're based on, the Kims' actions come to symbolize the lower class's desperation for a better life.\nWhen writing the story, Joon-ho said he experienced an epiphany that allowed him to conjure up the film's ironic and heart-wrenching conclusion: there will never be an end to economic disparity. Even though Ki-woo has legitimate talents, his forged resume represents that he is merely a fraud who is attempting to survive in a materialistic society.\u00a0\nNo amount of comedic relief in the first half of the film could have prepared viewers for the surprise that was to come knocking on their doors that fateful night, ominously accompanied by rain and the stench of desperation. On the same night that the Kims' temporary comfort was disrupted, a rainstorm terrorized their neighborhood as their semi-basement home was flooded with dirty water and the guilt of the sins they have committed.\nThe film's set design is reflective of the story's layers. Overlapping genres, themes and hierarchies were built into the house to show the film's complex elements struggling to coexist. Joon-ho emphasizes the metaphoric connotation of having levels within the house, between the rich and poor neighborhoods, and in the camera angles.\u00a0\nThe film concludes with a scene panning down from the Kims' basement window onto Ki-woo's futile hopes, mirroring the opening scene which is now tainted with despair and the acknowledgment of unachievable dreams. When the theater's lights came back on, movie-goers had no choice but to applaud the agonizing yet brilliant cinematic masterpiece that is \"Parasite.\""}, {"text": "May 30, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Fresh off the heels of a major victory at the 2019 Cannes[1] Film Festival, Bong Joon-ho[2]'s acclaimed dramatic thriller 'Parasite[3]' will open in select theaters October 11.

The only antecedent was El Artista, the French film that managed to win the statuette in 2012, but there its actors did not speak, and ended up being a tribute to silent cinema that found its years of rise in the early Hollywood industry.\nLast year this race was played by Roma, the film of the Mexican Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n that told the life of Cleo, a domestic employee set in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. This film, spoken in Spanish and Mixtec, shot in black and white, had an aggravating for the Academy: it was a production of Netflix, the streaming giant. It was one thing to give him an award as a foreign film, and quite another to give him the power of the big screen. That's how Green Book took the Oscar, much to the discontent of many.\nParasite may feel far away to the United States when we consider that it portrays families living thousands of miles from where the American dream is built. Awarding the prize to this production would involve a before and after in the most important award of world cinema.\nBong Joon Ho, director of \"Parasite\", at the BAFTA Awards (Photo: REUTERS/Toby Melville) (TOBY MELVILLE/)\nIn this film Ki-taek is the patriarch of a poor family that lives on a low floor in Seoul and survives on precarious work. The life of this humble clan will change radically when the son gets a job as an English teacher for a child in an upper-class house. We are not looking at a case of a film that is difficult to see and understand, nor that it encloses high artistic issues for those who do not belong to that niche. Parasite could perfectly be a popular American, French or Argentine film. It does not belong to indie cinema (independent and low budget); on the contrary, it has so far raised about $140 million, and goes for much more.\nFor those who never saw anything about Bong Joon-Ho, a movie like Parasite will be totally surprising. Those who, on the other hand, know this filmmaker, will appreciate in Parasite tones and themes very typical of one of the most important directors of contemporary cinema. To locate this director throughout his career, he has so far made seven feature films and belongs to a generation of new filmmakers from South Korea that have emerged since the mid-1990s.\nIn all these cases there is a strong imprint of political and social cinema, an interest that in the case of Bong Joo-Ho connects even with his own academic title (before dedicating himself to film graduated as a sociologist). Within these social interests, what persists most is a personal look at power relations. Not only because in his cinema there are tensions of class or authority (which most of the time is the same thing), but because more than once that power manifests itself awkwardly and even unconsciously. A clear example of this is in The Host. What stands out is that military forces can not only be cruel, but may lackall common sense and surrender to the obedience of a greater power (in this case that of the United States) without squeaking. In Memoirs of a Killer, for example, small-town policemen use confessions via torture not only because of a context of widespread violence (the film takes place during a right-wing dictatorship suffered by South Korea in the 1980s), but because they lack too much intelligence, and even in Okja the main villains present theself as a set of grotesque people who end up being overtaken in cunning by a teenage girl.\nOf course, so much emphasis on the improbability or ignorance of certain characters results in more than one occasion when Bong's cinema uses, and much, satire and humor. But it is also true that the stupidity or ignorance of some of his characters is not only comical but also harmful and tragic. And this is where we enter one of the most amazing features of its cinema: its unpredictability. Whoever enters Bong Joon-Ho's world enters a universe where it seems that anything can happen. His cinema is rich in narrative twists, and abrupt record changes that make it quickly move from the comical to the terrible. However, the interesting thing about your cinema is that these record changes, while looking rough at first glance, end up revealing as logical when you review the film or even finish thinking about it. I mean, Bong's cinema may be unpredictable, but this unpredictability is never free. Deep down, it ends up being a hopeful consequence, sometimes even logical both by the environment in which their characters live and by their own decisions.\n\"Parasite\" could perfectly be a popular American, French or Argentine film. It does not belong to indie cinema (independent and low budget); on the contrary, it has so far raised about $140 million, and goes for much more\nParasite is a perfect example of the latter aspect. Its plot revolves around a marginal family group in South Korea that uses the scam to gradually inhabit the home of a wealthy family. Their strategy will be that, progressively, each family member is occupying a different position, both from the servitude and the particular teaching staff of his children. At some point, Parasite is thematically twinned with two particularly resonant American films from last year: Us, by Jordan Peele, and especially Joker, by Todd Phillips. All these feature films have in common a similar idea: to present ourselves with a society divided into two very marked social classes, of which the lowest are furious and eager to occupy more privileged places, and the highest completely ignorant of what's happening with the most unfortunate sectors.\nHowever, there is one thing that makes Parasite very different from the other two: people who occupy privileged places are not shown at any time with contempt. Their petty attitudes, while they may exist, not necessarily make them horrible villains or even bad people, but simply people who were lucky enough to be born in peaceful places where they could build a much better future. In any case, what gave them that privileged life is a world surrounded by a bubble of happiness that turned them into very naive people tocertain things, which do not know who are the people who entered your home or fully know each corner of your own home.\nI KEPT READING\nThe \"Parasite\" event: why the South Korean film could kick the board on Oscarnight\n\"Parasite\": aspirations, wild capitalism and the brilliant portrait of a social carnage\n\"Camila\" at the Oscars: A priest's forbidden love with a young aristocrat that marked an era"}, {"text": "While a post-Oscars box office boost was already expected for Bong Joon Ho's       \u00a0    Parasite\u00a0tonight even with Best International Film and Best Director wins, now with a Best Picture win, the pic has a shot to go into the $40M-plus zone, possibly even more.

A slow progression of a poor family working for a rich family is where the movie derives its name, \"Parasite,\" as both leech off of each other in order to survive.\u00a0\nThe storyline of \"Parasite\" centers on struggles that the poor Kim family and the rich Park family each experience. The Kim family work at menial labor jobs and lament about their unfortunate life. One day the family's fortune changes when the poor son is presented with a prosperity stone and is offered the opportunity to tutor the rich family's high school daughter.\u00a0\nThe son's entry into the Park's affluent life provides him with opportunities to get the rest of his family jobs working for the rich Park family. The poor sister becomes an art therapist/counselor for the Park family's young son. The father is hired as Mr. Park's valet/driver. Mrs. Kim lands the coveted position as the Park's housekeeper after employing some dastardly machinations to oust the current long-time housekeeper.\u00a0\nBoth the rich and poor families are helpless without each other. This is evident when the naive Mrs. Park tries to cook and clean and Mr. Parks says his wife is an awful housekeeper. Mrs. Parks relies on her hired help to help her run the household and maintain her social status.\nThe true nature of the narrative is revealed when it starts to rain. The rain acts as a metaphor to accentuate the differences between the rich and the poor. To the rich, the deluge of water is viewed as a welcome act that is needed to wash away the city's grime, filth, and unpleasant odor that emanates from the \"the poor\".\u00a0\nMeanwhile, the deluge has the opposite effect for the Kim family.\u00a0 The Kim's family home is flooded and their belongings destroyed. While everything they own is ruined by the deluge of sewage, the rich remain unaffected and indifferent to how much the storm costs others.\u00a0\nThe movie's message doesn't stop there. The undercurrent digs even deeper to reveal how both the rich and poor need one another to survive. The old housekeeper brings back secrets to the house that shatter the integrated life of the Kims. The true cost of keeping up such a life of feeding off the rich is revealed.\u00a0\nParasite is a testament to the beauty of cleverly written characters working within a complex storyline. There is no one character in \"Parasite\" because they all dynamically work together to drive the plot.\nThe film cleverly interweaves a comedic storyline that is essentially about the symbiotic relationship of survival and interdependence between the haves and have-nots. The ending cleverly depicts how society exploits wealth inequality. The rich family solves their problem by moving on while the poor must figure a way out of their financial prison."}, {"text": "Is Cats actually going to be good? What are best practices when it comes to calming online haters? How did Parasite break through the clutter to become one of the year's biggest box office surprises? Do movie marketers love, hate or love to hate Rotten Tomatoes?\nThose were just a few of the subjects covered during \"Marketing Masterminds Roundtable: How to Break Through the Noise,\" a Wednesday afternoon\u00a0featured panel during Clio Entertainment's Creative Fest at NeueHouse Hollywood. Moderated by The Hollywood Reporter's editorial director, Matthew Belloni, it featured Dwight Caines, co-president of domestic marketing at Universal; Christina Kounelias, president of worldwide marketing at Participant; Tom Quinn, founder and CEO of Neon; and Angie Barrick, head of industry, media and entertainment at Google.\nThe first question Belloni tossed to the group at the event - billed as \"a community gathering that celebrates the art of entertainment marketing to create superfans around the globe,\" presented in partnership with THR - was their take on the year's biggest big-screen surprises, successes or failures. Caines quipped that he knows well enough \"never to speak about other people's failures,\" so instead he talked about his studio's recent success Good Boys. The performance of director Gene Stupnitsky's August release proved, to Caines, that \"the R-rated comedy is viable.\"\n\"We went into the campaign not fully knowing if we could get it done,\" he said. \"It was surprising that we were able to break through.\" He chalked the win up to multiple factors, including \"some key art that was just extraordinary\" that told the story in an effective way, including bold red coloring and the tagline \"You must be this tall to see this movie.\" The film opened to $21 million and has done more than $110 globally, he said.\u00a0\nKounelias turned her attention to Quinn and his company, praising their handling of Bong Joon-Ho's\u00a0Parasite\u00a0and how the indie distributor created a \"must-see\" event that she called a cultural touchpoint. \"They've done an amazing job with that,\" she said. \"It just popped. ... It feels urgent and strikes a lot of chords.\"\n\"How did you do that, Tom?\" Belloni asked Quinn, who gave a layered answer that ended with him giving full credit to the filmmaker. He said Bong Joon-Ho went to Cannes with the idea of asking journalists and fans not to include spoilers in their coverage, something that was largely respected by everyone. Quinn added that the veteran filmmaker is intimately involved in the marketing process. \"Every single frame of this campaign has been signed off on by Bong. Bong is a huge film fan. He loves the poster and trailer and just as much as he loves making the movie,\" Quinn said. \"All of that together, working together with the filmmaker, helped inform the campaign.\"\nThe group then spent a fair amount of time on the day's buzziest topic: Rotten Tomatoes. Belloni wanted to know how it influences moviegoers today, and if that has changed in recent years. \"I love Rotten Tomatoes,\" Kounelias said before quickly adding that her company's next release - Todd Haynes' Dark Waters - is currently sitting with a glowing 94 percent. \"It's a useful shorthand. It's the modern-day version of [two thumbs up].\"\u00a0\nQuinn got some laughs when he said that he used to loathe the rating system aggregated from critic reviews, but now that Neon has a lot of movies in the top 20 of the year, \"I love it.\" He said Neon has used the 99 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating for Parasite and\u00a0Apollo 11\u00a0\u00a0in marketing materials by putting it \"front and center.\"\n\"It's one more wonderful third-party affirmation that we desperately seek,\" Quinn continued. He did say, however, that he believes rival Metacritic will one day \"be more impactful,\" because \"it's definitely more accurate,\" as it relies on a more curated group of critics. That said, \"There is true merit to a Rotten Tomatoes score.\"\nCaines entered the debate with the disclaimer that Universal owns Rotten Tomatoes. With that out of the way, he said he agreed with Kounelias that the service provides a shorthand. \"We like it and good matters,\" he said, after explaining that one casualty is that it has taken the need to read thoughtful analysis and whittled it down to a juicy red tomato of approval or a negative green splat. That said, \"We can survive a bad Rotten Tomatoes score if we have a movie that is a crowd pleaser.\"\nBelloni then broached the subject of online backlash and asked the panelists how they determine when to respond to criticism of films and/or specific creative decisions. For example, he noted how Paramount responded after the studio weathered criticism over the look of the title character in its upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog film. Caines applauded Paramount's decision, particularly because he grew up with a Sega Genesis and considers himself a fan boy. \"That was a smart move,\" he added.\nTony Ung\nKounelias, who worked with Caines and his team on the Oscar-winning Green Book, said they received lots of feedback about that film during its long awards season haul. She said marketers don't necessarily have to act in response to \"whatever the thing\" is at the moment. \"Stay ahead of the audience,\" she said. \"Be with them. Be one of them. That's where the art comes in with the science. You have to understand what's happening culturally, emotionally with people and how you are relating to them, and what they want from you. They often want a relationship.\"\nBarrick jumped in with a point about how Google picks up on what the audience wants by digging through comments as well as seeing where users may rewind and replay specific moments in trailers. For example, she said after the launch of the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood trailer, analytics showed a large number of people were zeroing in on the Bruce Lee scene. \"The amount of rewinding that happened for Bruce Lee was really incredible for us to see,\" she said.\nSpeaking of trailers, Caines addressed the phenomenon that is the Cats trailer, a subject initially brought up by Belloni. \"The response to Cats is that it's tracking just like Cats the musical. It's a very polarizing property,\" he said, before defending what he's seen as the opposite of what many critics or skeptics believe it will be. He called the finished film delightful. \"It's a dance movie. It's really great family entertainment.

It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho. Parasite is a bizarre black comedy about social status, aspiration, materialism and the patriarchal family unit, and people who accept the idea of having (or leasing) a servant class. Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern-day Downton Abbey upstairs-downstairs situation, one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises. The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean, and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch. But it is an enjoyable, elegant, scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema. The film, which is sumptuously designed, could be compared with, say,       \u00a0    Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden, an adaptation of the novel Fingersmith by Sarah Walters; and also       \u00a0    Im Sang-son's 2010 Cannes entry The Housemaid, a remake of Kim Ki-Young's classic Korean thriller from 1960. Also notable is the film's focus on poverty, desperation and the phenomenon of those in debt having to vanish to escape creditors (also a theme in       \u00a0    Lee Chang-dong's 2018 film Burning ). Song Kang-ho plays Ki-taek, a shiftless, unemployed man who lives in a chaotic, stinky and squalid basement with his wife, Chung-sook, his smart yet cynical twentysomething daughter, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), and son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik). They are all out of work and out of cash. \nThen Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune: an old school-friend helps him get a lucrative tutoring job. With a fake college diploma created by Ki-jung, he shows up at the fabulously lavish home of the Park family, wealthy entrepreneur Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun), his delicate, unworldly wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), their teen daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso) and her wacky kid brother, Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). They have a loyal, live-in housekeeper named Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee). Likable Ki-woo is an instant hit with his new employers and his demure pupil Da-hye gets a real crush on him, which the coolly ruthless Ki-woo does nothing to discourage. Then the distrait lady of the house, Yeon-kyo, reveals that she also needs an art tutor for her young son, to mould his painting talents; Ki-woo suggests his sister (while concealing their relationship), and soon the brazen Ki-jung is also a success with these rich suckers. It looks as if the wealthy Parks could be a meal ticket for the whole crooked family, all pretending to be complete strangers to each other. But little-kid Da-song has noticed something that the grownups haven't: why do these people smell the same? The servant is someone with an intimate knowledge of his or her employer, and yet this intimacy is so easily - and inevitably - poisoned with resentment. There is a licensed transgression in servitude, and this transgression is nightmarishly amplified when it is a question of a entire family seeking to get up close and personal. The poorer family see themselves in a distorting mirror that cruelly reveals to them how wretched they are by contrast and reveals the riches that could - and should - be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story; an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its tendrils into you."}, {"text": "Mar 27, 2020( BGR: Your Mobile Life: http://www.bgr.in Delivered by Newstex)  If you're stuck at home due to the Coronavirus lockdown, chances are you've been binging on movies and shows that you've been wanting to catch up on for a long time.

However, there are both Hindi and English subtitles.Watch: Oppo Reno 3 Pro Review Parasite: List of awardsThe South Korean movie recently made history by becoming the first foreign-language film to bag an Academy Award in the Best Picture category. It also won director Bong Joon-Ho the Best Director award for a non-English film. Moreover, the film also won a third Oscar award for Best Original Screenplay. Apart from the Oscars, Parasite[2] has also won numerous awards. These include the 2020 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film, 2019 Palme d'Or, and the 2020 BAFTA Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. The film also won the Best Original Screenplay, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for 2020, among many others. Parasite revolves around the tale of two families. One is quite rich and well-to-do. Meanwhile the other is poor and will go to any lengths to make ends meet. The emphasis on class discrimination, greed and apathy are brought to light when the families meet and enter a unique inter-dependent relationship.  https://www.bgr.in/news/pornhub-offering-premium-to-everyone-for-free-to-encourage-staying-at-home-coronavirus-882384/Also ReadPornhub made Premium free for everyone to encourage staying home[3]Amazon also recently made a bunch of content free on its Prime Video platform.

Bong Joon-Ho, the South Korean writer-director who brought us \n                   Okja                   \n and \n                   Snowpiercer                   \n, has returned with another hilarious, strange and wildly imaginative concoction. It centres on a family of four: Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), his wife Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-Jin) and their twentysomething son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam)\nThey make a sorry quartet, crammed into a tiny basement flat, where they earn tiny sums from folding pizza boxes, watch drunks urinate against their window and scrounge free wifi from neighbouring caf\u00e9s. Ki-jung crouches beside the toilet to get a signal and they open cans of beer to \"toast their reconnection\".\nYet their good-humoured squabbling conceals a streak of creative opportunism that surfaces when a friend of Ki-woo's offers him the chance to take over his job tutoring the daughter of a wealthy businessman. He and his family live in a vast modernist house that couldn't be more different from Ki-woo and co's dismal digs. It's an extraordinary space, all clean lines of glass and stone, that almost becomes a character in the film.\nKi-woo's sister forges him a university diploma and he wastes no time in inveigling his way into the affections of the girl and her mother (the excellent Cho Yeo-jeong), who is as trusting as she is generous with her husband's money. \"She's rich, but she's still nice,\" says Ki-taek. \"She's nice because she's rich,\" Chung-sook corrects.\nEither way, the rest of Ki-woo's family are soon assuming aliases to get on the payroll of their oblivious benefactors, as chauffeur, housekeeper and art teacher to their disturbed young son. The deceptions become increasingly byzantine; the scenes in which they practise their lines are a hoot, as is Chung-sook's impression of North Korean news announcers.\nWhat's already an entertaining yarn - like a heist movie crossed with a domestic farce - is then sent spinning off in a new direction by a totally unexpected twist. The film veers between comedy, social commentary and much darker fare with the woozy confidence of an intoxicated person attempting a death-defying feat. Whatever Bong puts in his bong must be darn strong. You expect the whole enterprise to come crashing down around his ears, but this is a film-maker in total control of his craft. \n                   Parasite                   \n must be a long shot to win the Palme d'Or."}, {"text": "Star Rating: 4 stars\nB ong Joon-ho broke through to global acclaim with an Oscar for his film Parasite, and now the rerelease of his black comic thriller Memories of Murder from 2003 reminds you that, along with all his other glittering prizes and achievements, this director also helped catch the most notorious serial killer in South Korean history. His film is based on the Hwaseong serial murders of the late 1980s; they remained unsolved until this film came out, sparking a renewed upsurge of interest in the case, which led finally to the identification of the culprit last year - who was already serving a life sentence for the murder of his sister-in-law in 1994.\nWith the benefit of hindsight, we can see how the film challenges and subverts the serial killer procedural in its entirety; Anglo-Hollywood cops on the trail of psychopathic monsters tend to be tough professionals, or forensic savants - or they can be fascinatingly \"flawed\" with weaknesses or vulnerabilities that only underline how sympathetic they actually are. The officers in Memories of Murder are quite different. Veteran actor Song Kang-ho (the dad from Parasite) is the beefy, cynical Inspector Park; his dopey and aggressive sidekick is Inspector Cho (Kim Roe-ha) who beats suspects and uses a special woollen oven mitt-style overshoe to put on his boot when he wants to kick someone to avoid leaving a mark. A young cop transferred from Seoul, Inspector Seo (Kim Sang-kyung) has more professionalism but he, like the other two, is hopelessly out of his depth.\nThe crime scene itself - that holy of holies in serial killer movies - is chaotically compromised, with press and public barging all over the place, ruining the evidence, and the incompetent cops unable to stop them, and more than content to try beating confessions out of fantasists and inadequates. They are humiliatingly reliant on superior DNA labs in the US, and when Seo has some good ideas, his superiors can't give him the manpower he needs because all of the police are needed to suppress demonstrations. Memories of Murder is a great satire of official laxity and arrogance, and its final scene is very chilling."}, {"text": "The director Bong Joon Ho discusses a sequence from his film.\nIn \u201cAnatomy of a Scene,\u201d we ask directors to reveal the secrets that go into making key scenes in their movies.

Faced with their obvious economic needs they have made a culture of research, of the trap (of the \"plan\", as they tell it) and that will be what they will use when entering, one by one, in the luxurious house of the Parks to work all there, from an opportunity that will be p Resent Ki-woo from being the English tutor to the eldest daughter of that wealthy family.\nThe young man, who was unable to pursue college school as his friends and has to forge his credentials, first brings in his older sister, Ki-jeong (who introduces himself with the studied expression \"Jessica, only daughter, Illinois, Chicago\"), who convinces the unborn so innocent \"mom Park\" that her youngest son needs an art therapy that she can provide. The girl then kicks out the Park driver and puts her father in fulfilling that function. And immediately afterwards, through an even more elaborate plan, Ki-jeong manages to sicken the maid of the house and replace her with her own mother. So the Kims have gone on to be all employed by the Parks without these millionaires, a little distracted in their own follies, to realize. Of course, homeowners have no idea that the Kims are a family: they assume they don't know each other. The only one who feels anything strange is the little boy, who notices that the four \"smell alike\".\nThis is just the beginning, the narrative starting point of Parasite, the movie-feeling of the season, another unclassifiable cross-genre jumping game from Bong Joon-ho, the Korean director of the magnificent Memories of Murder and The Host. This mix of comedy, thriller, police thriller, horror film and politically tinged family drama won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and has just earned six Oscar nominations, which is rare in non-English-spoken films. Rare is also the critical unanimity and fervor that aroused in its wake. Unlike 99 percent of such lyre films, it's virtually impossible to read or hear bad reviews about Bong's film. This isn't where they'll necessarily read that, but they will.I have the impression that the film \u2013 of almost perfect narrative construction and visually impeccable based on its limited spaces of action and movements \u2013 has some complicated or challenging ideas, depending on the view of each viewer, about each viewer's point of view, about of the world it portrays. And they're not that simple to unravel.\nMost of Parasite's analyses put the focus \u2013 in addition to celebrating its impeccable plot of deception, the accumulation of narrative surprises in its second half and the growing tension that develops \u2013 in the kind of literal class struggle that would take place between the Park and the Kims, when the film actually conceals or hides other equally or more central battles: the Kims's with the other people of their own social stratum (yes, those they get kicked out of their respective jobs) or with those who are even worse off , characters that will then emerge from the depths when one least expects them. Since it is impossible to advance further on this line of thought without revealing details of the plot, I will leave it here, in suspense, understanding that the viewer, when watching the film, will know what I mean.\nIt is there that Parasite becomes a movie no longer in terms of \"cat versus mouse\" (or vice versa), in which the tricks and traps of a needy family become justifiable in terms of cheating on self-absorbed millionaires, but in a kind of \"dog eats dog\" (by \"dog eats dog\" (by \"dog eats dog\" (by continue with the metaphors of the animal world), a kind of worth everything among the desclasated of the system to be able to enter it, to belong, to be safe from the dangers, natural or socioeconomic, of the real world. It's a format we've seen in several films - only in Argentina are the cases of The Owners or Good Life Delivery, while, internationally, some Michael Haneke titles also have similar ideas and themes - only here they are framed in a proposal in appearance so genderthat any social commentary seems to be in the background.\nBong's clever trick, which makes the film much more complex than that simplistic initial look at the world seems to present, is to deflect attention to one side when the real story passes on the other and then spin it again on its axis. Not only that, but when one already thinks he has assimilated the logic of the film, the filmmaker puts those lines together in the most unexpected ways, revealing his magic pass and justifying, in a way perhaps somewhat cruel and cynical but certainly intelligent , their previous narrative decisions. It is a bloody and aggressive, aspirational world, in which the one who has nothing wants to have something, the one who has that something wants to have more at the expense of whoever and, finally, the one who has everything would prefer that everyone below continue to live in hiding , without \"going over the line\", in subsoils or shelters, where they are not smelled and, preferably, also not seen.\nParasite \u2013 the ingenious thing about the title is not knowing who the film is talking about \u2013 is a brilliant portrait of that social carnage, a kind of sinister experiment of those that so many psychologists tended to organize by putting some conflicting element in the midst of a heterogeneous group of people until some of its members were brought out, the worst of themselves in order to win that battle. In its ideologically confusing but narratively very effective way (to such apoint that takes a couple of visions to notice such ambiguities), Bong ends up reaffirming that there is no culprit among the characters of this funny but ultimately macabre story, that the guilt is fundamentally systemic and that for many it has the name of \" wild capitalism.\" In fact, that expression would not look bad as a title for this film that will surely leave almost everyone ecstatic but, at the same time, looking suspiciously for all sides as they leave the cinema.\n*The original note was published in The Agenda\nFOLLOW READING:\nLatin American cinema takes Sundance Film Festival\n100 years by Federico Fellini: a tour of the gaze and essential works of a unique director"}, {"text": "Bong Joon-ho's Palme d'Or winner \"Parasite\" revolves around a family that overtakes a wealthy residence, bit by bit, but the best sequence finds them trapped. When an unexpected development (no spoilers here) puts their scheme at risk, they're forced to hide in various corridors of the expansive house, under floorboards and in the walls. It's a startling visual embodiment of the class warfare at the heart of the movie - and in much of Bong's work, from \"Barking Dogs Never Bite\" to \"Snowpiercer\" - wherein less fortunate people attempt to take control of the conditions holding them down, and wind up stuck somewhere in the middle.\nBong's directorial talents were long overdue for this prize: His slick ability to compose rich visuals in every frame, with complex characters almost too driven for their own good, has made him one of the greatest working filmmakers for years now. But \"Parasite\" was also an ideal choice for the top prize at this year's Cannes in a year when many of the best movies in Competition dealt with the same potent theme.\nConsider \"Atlantics.\" Mati Diop's surreal Grand Prix winner follows a group of women in Dakar abandoned by several young men who flee to the ocean in a quest to reach the coast of Spain. Ada (Mama San\u00e9) is left to contend with a forced marriage to Omar (Barbara Sylla), a wealthy man whom her family hopes will support them. Ada feels trapped: On the one hand, she resents her lover abandoning her in a dreary, impoverished life; at the same time, she's expected to suppress her emotions for the sake of her family's stability.\nAs \"Atlantics\" heads in an eerie, supernatural direction, and the ghosts of men who departed for the sea come back to haunt Ada's small community, the movie creates the impression of a world defined by the haves and have-nots. Only through a profound, otherworldly set of circumstances can Ava even begin to contemplate the idea of an escape, but never once does it seem realistic.\nSo it goes in \"Les Miserables\" and \"Bacurau,\" the movies that shared this year's Jury Prize. In Ladj Ly's \"Les Miserables,\" thick-skulled police officers persecute a Muslim community in Paris for no reason other than their ongoing desire to confirm their superiority. Their mounting acts of aggression toward one rebellious Muslim youth lead to a dynamic showdown in an apartment complex when the entire neighborhood acts out in revolt.\nThat ending is mirrored rather closely in \"Bacurau,\" Kleber Mendonca Filho and Juliano Dornelles' futuristic Brazilian Western, when a remote town bands together to fight back against mysterious vigilantes. Their purpose hovers in an ambiguous state for much of the story, but they take on a profound symbolic quality as the movie builds to its bloody finale, as a self-sustaining world defined by its self-sustaining ethos suddenly must fight to sustain its existence.\nThe stakes take on more personal ramifications in \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire,\" Celine Sciamma's screenplay winner, which finds a wealthy young woman named Heloise (Adele Hanele) falling for lower-class painter Marianne (No\u00e9mie Merlant) in the 18th century. Their bond is powerful, intimate, and essentially impossible: While the movie doesn't waste time exploring the taboos associated with same-sex attraction at the time, remaining close to its main characters' developing bond, it magnifies just how much Heloise has been trapped by her palatial circumstances. As with Ada in \"Atlantics,\" Heloise is expected to marry a man who can support her and keep her comfortable, but that assumption doesn't take into account what she actually wants for herself. Her love affair is a quiet act of rebellion against the system holding her in place.\nWhile the fixation of these Cannes entries suggests a mounting discontent with wealth and persecution around the world, Ken Loach got there first. The British auteur has been the ultimate chronicler of underclass frustrations for over half a century, and his Competition entry \"Sorry We Missed You\" is a vintage example. Tackling the gig economy head-on, Loach focuses on desperate family man Ricky (Kris Hitchen) as he takes on a contract gig driving a delivery van around London, signing away his rights in the process. Loach excels at showing how vast industrial systems exploit the working man, and Ricky's innocuous descent into a machine keen on eating him alive is tragic to watch, mostly because it feels so real.\nNevertheless, the narrative of this year's Cannes goes back to the beginning. Jim Jarmusch's \"The Dead Don't Die\" opened the festival to lukewarm reviews, but the master of deadpan's dark zombie comedy is nothing if not a pointed critique of an exploitative system. The undead in Jarmusch's kooky ensemble are drawn to products that they obsessed over in their lives - wifi, Xanax, coffee, you name it - and it doesn't take much to see just how much contempt Jarmusch has for the way we've all become materialistic slaves.\nIt's a blunt metaphor, explained in bitter terms in Tom Waits' apocalyptic voiceover, but in retrospect it set the stage for the festival's many depictions of global outrage against capitalist persecution. Wealth attracts and it takes away; in the process, it catalyzes dramatic narratives that must be told. Even bad movies can be portals to the fears, anxieties, and frustrations of the times in which they're made; the 2019 Cannes Film Festival brought us some great ones.\nLaunch Gallery: 2019 Cannes Film Festival Red Carpet: Taron Egerton, Richard Madden, and More (Photos)"}, {"text": "Arich man walks up the stairs of his extravagant home. With each step, a lamp goes on above his head, lighting his path. He doesn't think twice about why the lights are timed to his steps. He's so used to always being in the light he hardly notices.\nWhat's going on with those lights is one small mystery among many in Bong Joon Ho's brilliant social thriller \"Parasite.\" It's the third film (after \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja\") in which Bong turns the inequities of late capitalism into unnerving, darkly funny and constantly surprising high-end entertainment.\nWhile \"Snowpiercer\" turned the class system into a series of train cars hurtling on an express ride to nowhere, \"Parasite\" turns the metaphor on its end. At the literal bottom of an unnamed South Korean city is the Kim family, crowded together in a semi-basement apartment that gives them a ringside seat to watch drunks peeing in the street.\nThe family scrapes by on menial jobs like folding pizza boxes, but teenage son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) dreams of something better. A friend gives him a heavy stone that's supposed to bring good luck, a metaphor for the elusive dream of upward mobility. If it's so lucky, then why does it weigh him down so much?\nBut luck does come. A friend is off to college, and offers Ki-woo the chance to take his place tutoring the teenage daughter of a rich family who lives up the hill. As Ki-woo heads up to their mansion, the difference between his circumstances and theirs is literally night and day ? the first time we see sunlight in the film is the moment when he enters their perfectly manicured backyard.\nThe house (actually a set built for the film) is an architectural marvel, a series of interlocking boxes with giant picture windows everywhere. But the windows only offer views of the grounds ? giant hedges block the messiness of the outside world. The family pays a lot of money to forget that the rest of the world doesn't live as they do.\nMr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) glide through life, pleasant but distant, so used to things going their way that they can't imagine any other way of living. Ki-woo is entranced by their world, and soon convinces his sister Ki-jung (Park Sodam) to forge some credentials and get a job as an art therapist for the Parks' young son. Then comes mom and dad, hired on as the Parks' maid and personal driver. This means finding some diabolically sneaky ways of getting the current staff fired, and as clever and funny as the schemes are, the laughs stick in our throat a little. We're watching a family do whatever's necessary to go from the bottom rung of the ladder to the second-from-the-bottom rung. Meanwhile, the rich family is oblivious ? what's one maid compared with another?\nI won't reveal any more, except that the family's scheme to keep living the good life ? or at least, to serve those who live the good life ? is tested in ways they never imagined. Bong is brilliant at dispensing some wild plot twists, and shifting between several tones for the film. Some scenes have the daffy precision of a bedroom farce, others the claustrophobic tension of a home invasion thriller.\nBong handles these shifts confidently, and beneath the film's visual wit and narrative elegance burns an undeniable anger at a world divided into Parks and Kims. Which family is the real parasite, feeding off the other, is a provocative question that lingers long after the movie's ended and our heart rates have returned to normal.\nPARASITE\nFour stars\nChoi Woo-sik, Cho Yeo-seong\nR for language, violence and sexual content\n2 hours 11 minutes\nNow playing at AMC Madison 6 and Marcus Point"}, {"text": "Oscars 2020 is here and the best of Hollywood is being honoured tonight.

Here are my choices for the top 10 movies of 2019\n1. \u201cParasite\u201d \u2022 A family of poor con artists insinuate themselves in the lives of a rich Seoul family, taking servants\u2019 jobs through means fair and foul \u2014 only to find out there\u2019s a deeper secret within the walls of the opulent house. Director Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s modern-day thriller is a bloody mystery, a precisely observed family drama, and a sly but sharp commentary on the haves and the have-nots. (Now in theaters.)\n2. \u201cThe Irishman\u201d \u2022 The late-career work we\u2019ve been waiting for Martin Scorsese to make recounts the memories of fixer and hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). His tales of working through the Philly mob and becoming a confidante of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) are fascinating, even if they might be historically suspect. With a cast led by De Niro, Pacino and an out-of-retirement Joe Pesci, Scorsese builds on his gangster-movie reputation to create a searing drama and a meditation on the grave that awaits us all. (Streaming on Netflix.)\n3. \u201cHer Smell\u201d \u2022 Meet Becky Something, a punk-rock queen who\u2019s spiraling out of control \u2014 and writer-director Alex Ross Perry takes us along for the ride, as Becky (brilliantly played by Elisabeth Moss) alienates her bandmates, tries to wield control over an up-and-coming band, and burns almost all her bridges toward recovery. With Moss and a strong supporting cast, led by Agyness Deyn as Becky\u2019s much-abused bass player and collaborator, Perry creates a kinetic masterpiece of a rocker\u2019s fall and unsteady revival.

Marianne\u2019s challenge is that H\u00e9loise doesn\u2019t want to sit for a portrait, so the artist must befriend her subject and observe her looks \u2014 and paint from memory on the sly. Writer-director C\u00e9line Sciamma herself paints a luminous picture of passions, sexual and otherwise, and the liberation of female connection. (Opens at the Broadway Centre Cinemas on Feb. 28.)\n5. \u201cAvengers Endgame\u201d and \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d \u2022 In a year when some franchises \u2014 like \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cStar Wars\u201d \u2014 ended with some disappointment, the Marvel Cinematic Universe stuck the landing with the satisfying \u201cAvengers Endgame.\u201d Our heroes sacrifice much, sometimes all, to restore the universe altered by Thanos, in a story that balances humor, heartbreak and action perfectly. The franchise also produced \u201cCaptain Marvel,\u201d a rousing Marvel character introduction, with Brie Larson as the headstrong heroine caught between her human past and her Kree present, and Samuel L. Jackson showing us how Nick Fury became the Avengers\u2019 chief recruiter. (Streaming on Disney+ and available on Blu-ray.)\n6. \u201cApollo 11\u201d \u2022 Want to go to the moon? Director Todd Douglas Miller does the next best thing in this engrossing documentary, reconstructing the first mission to the moon through a wealth of archival footage \u2014 much of it never seen since the launch in 1969 \u2014 and a sound design that makes the viewer feel the rockets are under their seats. (Available on demand or on Blu-ray.)\n7. \u201cMs. Purple\u201d \u2022 Kasie (Tiffany Chu, in a stunning debut) works as a karaoke hostess in a Koreatown bar, trying to make enough money to help her dying father. Desperate when her dad\u2019s caretaker quits, Katie calls on her estranged brother, Carey (Teddy Lee), to help out \u2014 and, in so doing, reopens old wounds from their abusive childhood. Director Justin Chon\u2019s detailed, intense drama burrows under the viewer\u2019s skin and doesn\u2019t let go. (Available on demand.)\n8. \u201cOne Child Nation\u201d \u2022 Nanfu Wang had something growing up in China that few girls her age did a sibling. Wang, now living in America, returns to China to talk to officials and family members about that country\u2019s brutal one-child policy, in place from 1970 to 2015, and how it forever altered generations of Chinese people. (Streaming on Amazon Prime.)\n9. \u201cBooksmart\u201d \u2022 This raucous and winning teen comedy is refreshingly of the moment, as it tracks two straight-A students (Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein) on the last day of school, when they realize they\u2019ve missed out on partying and try to make it all up in one night. The results, in the hands of first-time director Olivia Wilde, is both riotously funny and a perfect distillation of freshly minted high-schoolers both eager for and terrified of the next step. (Available on demand or on Blu-ray.)\n10. \u201cThe Farewell\u201d \u2022 Director-writer Lulu Wang tells the true story of a Chinese-American writer (Awkwafina) who\u2019s told her favorite grandma (Shuzhen Zhao) has terminal cancer. What\u2019s more, the family has opted not to tell her, but are all going to China to visit her one last time, using the pretense of a wedding.

But in fact, he's had a terrific career in Korean films for more than 20 years.\nSong was first mentioned in Variety on Nov. 23, 1998, in a review of the film \"The Quiet Family.\" Asked if he remembers the review, he says, \"Of course I was aware of Variety at the time, because Variety is a famous magazine. I don't remember the review, but it's positive, so thank you!\n\"In the beginning, I read every single review. I was affected by each one, whether praise or criticism. As time has passed, I don't think reviews are so important.\"\nNeon's \"Parasite\" marks the actor's fourth film with writer-director Bong Joon Ho. \"When making it, I had the feeling it was special. The structure is unique, and I understood the message he wanted to deliver.\"\nWhen did you know you wanted to be an actor?In my early 20s. I wanted to become a good actor, but I didn't have a role model. Nobody else in the family was in entertainment. They didn't approve of my choice. They didn't like it. It's not just my family: In general, if a family is told you want to be a theater actor, they say, \"No, are you crazy?\" I thought of acting as a career from the beginning. I envisioned remaining a theater actor. I went to school, to an acting program, but only for a short while. My real training was with a theater company that I was a member of for years. The name of the company translates as \"Theater Friends Stage.\" My pay was very low, of course. I think culturally, theater is not where you make money as an actor.\nDid you audition much?The last time I auditioned was 20 years ago. I never auditioned for stage, because I was a member of that theater company. For film, it was more of a meeting with the director than an audition. Auditions are pretty common these days for young actors. I consider myself lucky. If I had to audition, I probably would not get any roles.\nWhen you started out, did you want to do film work?At the beginning, I was reluctant to act in movies. At that time, 20-30 years ago - no, say 20: I'm not that old! - the status of the Korean film industry was not as high as it is now. And the film industry was not so welcoming to actors from the theater. I had watched other actors struggle or fail in making that transition. But I was lucky enough to have a fairly easy transition. With films, it was hard to have all the waiting. What's funny is that now, I wish I could have a little more down time. Directors these days are working very fast, so waiting time is less and less. I think directors and crews are much better prepared than before.\nDid you get any good advice?I don't remember a specific person, but one of my senior actors onstage said: \"Do not become a technical actor. Do not act in a typical, predictable way.\" That was advice I still try to follow.\nAny plans to return to theater?The last time I was onstage was 20 years ago. You can blame this on my inability to multitask. And the longer I stay away, the more fearful I become.\nDid you like \"The Quiet Family\"?It's one of my favorites. It's a unique film, and it was fun to make. It's about a family, and it's an ensemble film, but it's very different from \"Parasite.\"\nMore from Variety\nAfter 'Snowpiercer' and 'Parasite' Korea's CJ Entertainment Hatches Plans to Become a Global Studio      \u00a0    'Parasite' to Become Year's Highest-Grossing Foreign Film in the U.S.      \u00a0    Class Warfare Animates This Year's Awards Season"}, {"text": "Editor's note: This article contains spoilers for Parasite.\nIt's no secret that Parasite, the latest film from South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho, has swept the globe. With its shocking twists, its meditated commentary on wealth inequality, and its historic accolades, Parasite is not only a critical and commercial success, but also a personal win for its Asian and Asian-American fans at Oberlin.\nThis past Saturday, College fourth-years and East Asian Studies student representatives Will Cramer and Liam Hefta organized a free dinner and discussion followed by a group screening at the Apollo Theatre, with support from the East Asian Studies Department, Oberlin Korean Student Association, and Asian American Alliance. While Cramer personally enjoyed the film, he also saw it as an opportunity to promote East Asian cinema and the East Asian Studies department to interested students.\n\"I thought it would be good to showcase East Asian cinema, and there are [professors like] Keren He who teach on East Asian cinema,\" Cramer said. \"And then Parasite on its own is such an amazing movie, so it was a way to draw people in, get them interested.\"\nCramer and Hefta approached Associate Professor of History and East Asian Studies Emer O'Dwyer with the idea, who said she was \"all for it.\"\u00a0\nParasite presents its audience with two families: the Kims and the Parks. The Parks live in a private lot with a wide green lawn, a personal housekeeper, and the best private tutors for their children. In contrast, the Kims lead a more modest life; we first meet the Kim siblings Ki-woo and Ki-jung as they scuttle about their semi-basement apartment trying to pick up on a free Wi-Fi signal while their father, Ki-taek, lets pesticide spray inside as \"free extermination.\" There is no reason for these families to ever cross paths - but when Ki-woo's friend Min asks him to take over as Da-hye Park's English tutor by faking his credentials, it is an economic prospect that Ki-woo cannot resist.\u00a0\nThus begins an erratic, nearly unbelievable string of events all motivated by lies, deception, and greed. Parasite teeters wildly between genres, but it retains a dark satirical commentary on the pitfalls of capitalism throughout.\nWhile Parasite is a contemporary film about South Korean society, it includes wider global issues and influences that intertwine seamlessly: wealth inequality, classism, and climate change. Midway through the film, a torrential rainstorm hits Seoul, flooding the Kims' apartment and forcing them to take shelter with hundreds of other displaced families in a gymnasium. As the scene cuts to the next morning, we open on the Park family home, where the family's matriarch, Yeon-kyo, marvels at how nice the sunshine is for her spoiled son's birthday party. While not intentionally malicious toward the lower class, the Parks embody the utter obliviousness that is characteristic of privileged upper-class society.\u00a0\n\"No place is immune from this environmental devastation,\" O'Dwyer commented on the rainstorm. \"However, as Director Bong suggests, the wealthy have many more resources and choices when confronted by it.\"\u00a0\nFor Oberlin's Asian students and faculty, Parasite's widespread viewership and critical acclaim is a personal victory. Visiting Instructor of History Jiyul Kim, who is Korean-American, recalled how he was \"amused and appreciative\" of non-Korean viewers who were so willing to watch a movie that was \"so quintessentially Korean\" in its imagery, themes, and script.\u00a0\n\"My first impression after the movie was to ask myself how someone not familiar with South Korean society and culture could really understand the nuances of the images and language [in the film],\" Kim wrote in an email to the Review. \"But my 13-year-old son's reaction made me realize how wrong I was. This young man, who [is] only half-Korean by blood and all-American teenager in culture, emphatically said, 'That was the best movie I have ever seen.'\"\u00a0\nKim further explained various details that were distinctive of South Korean culture in the film.\n\"For example, [the film alludes to] the politics of private tutoring, which has been made illegal because it gave the rich unfair advantage in the hyper-competitive South Korean education system.\"\u00a0\nThe way Parasite explores universal themes with a distinctly South Korean presentation is what makes it truly groundbreaking. From winning the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival to sweeping the four major categories at the Oscars - becoming the first foreign film to win Best Picture - Parasite, along with Roma in 2018, could be reflective of a changing American entertainment landscape opening its doors to non-Western cinema.\n\"Clearly I agree with the vast majority of non-Korean viewers that Parasite's universal appeal has to do with its socioeconomic subject and message, which comes across regardless of any opaque cultural filters,\" Kim wrote. \"And it's also because that universal message was presented through an entertaining and memorable story, an intoxicating cocktail of drama, comedy, and horror that lingers long after.\"\nParasite's masterful storytelling and its numerous awards legitimize foreign films as not only worth watching, but capable of winning awards alongside Hollywood blockbusters, and whose non-white, non-English-speaking casts proudly grace the stage.\nCollege second-year and Chinese-American student Michelle Tyson attested to the value of international representation and the use of films to focus on marginalized groups such as the Kim family.\u00a0\n\"I'm so proud of a film that features really amazing South Korean actors and a story that so blatantly deals with class,\" Tyson wrote in an email to the Review. \"The public reception to films like Moonlight and Roma, which, like Parasite, made me so grateful to see marginalized identities and class so clearly portrayed on the big screen.\"\nCollege second-year Rachel Fang, while having a slightly different perspective as a Chinese international student, discussed that after growing up watching numerous high-quality, Asian-made movies, she hopes that Parasite introduces white American audiences to everything that global cinema has to offer.\n\"As an international student seeing lots and lots of Asian movies ... Parasite is just one of the good movies that I've seen,\" Fang said. \"I hope more people can get the chance to watch more good Asian movies because there are a lot of Asian movies that are as good as Parasite that [have] not [been] nominated [at] the Oscars.\"\nWhile Parasite is only one film, and may not guarantee greater diversity in future awards shows, it has still disrupted what has long been a stagnant lineup.\n\"Will [Parasite] have staying power?\" Kim pondered. \"The true impact won't be known for decades. Still, at the very least, I think Parasite's win has opened many people's eyes to Korean cinema, which has become very vibrant and relevant, so I hope it will lead to wider viewership and appreciation for Korean films.\""}, {"text": "January 14 -- The 92nd Academy Awards take place on February 9, 2020, and it's undoubtedly the hottest ticket in the Hollywood calendar. Every big movie star will be there, all to celebrate the very best the movie industry work from the past year. Who, though, is likely to win in 2020? The 2020 Oscar nominations are now out there, so we know which movies and starts are in contention.\u00a0\nBelow, we've taken our best guess at who'll win big on Oscar night. We've based our predictions on the shortlists and winners for other big Hollywood awards (the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the BAFTAs) and tapped into pre-Academy Award buzz to work out who we think will have the best chance on Oscar night.\nWill The Irishman make a killing for Netflix? Will Once Upon a Time in Hollywood give Quentin Tarantino his first Best Picture win? Or will Joker become the first comic book movie to take the big prize? That last one might be a little optimistic, but you never know.\u00a0\nWe take a look at the contenders to work out the likely nominations for this year's Oscars - and predict who might be delivering a victory speech on the night...\u00a0\nWhen are the 2020 Oscars?The awards themselves take place on Sunday, February 9.\u00a0\nBest Picture 2020 Oscar predictions\n\u2022\tFord V Ferrari\n\u2022\tThe Irishman\n\u2022\tJojo Rabbit\n\u2022\tJoker\n\u2022\tLittle Women\n\u2022\tMarriage Story\n\u2022\t1917\n\u2022\tOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\u2022\tParasite\nIf you were hoping Avengers: Endgame might squeeze out a nomination this year, it's hard luck. This is pretty much what we predicted the shortlist would be, although Ford V Ferrari surprised us by making it in, and it's a shame Bombshell didn't get a nod in the best picture category. Otherwise, it's wall-to-wall prestige movies with the exception of Joker, which feels more likely to win in an acting category rather than Best Picture.\u00a0\nWho do we think will win? Given the talent involved and the technical achievement of successfully de-ageing Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, it's hard to look past The Irishman.\u00a0But 1917, winning the Golden Globe for the equivalent category and getting a sweep of Bafta nominations, may have an edge in awards season.\nWho do we want to win? It would be exciting to see Parasite take this award instead of the more predictable contenders.\u00a0\nBest Director Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tMartin Scorsese (The Irishman)\n\u2022\tTodd Phillips (Joker)\n\u2022\tSam Mendes (1917)\n\u2022\tQuentin Tarantino (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)\n\u2022\tBong Joon-ho (Parasite)\nThe Academy snubbed Greta Gerwig this year, which is a real shame, leaving an all-male category of contenders. The competition will be stiff, nonetheless: Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes (whose all-in-one-shot war movie 1917 brings plenty of wow factor) are both vying for their second Best Director prize, while Quentin Tarantino will be hungry for his first after his best-received movie in years. And don't bet against Korean director Bong Joon-ho's work on Parasite.\u00a0\nWho do we think will win? A much-loved movie directed by an icon of cinema means Scorsese is the person to beat - assuming there's no anti-Netflix backlash, as there has been in previous years.\u00a0Tarantino, however, won the Golden Globe, which suggests he's more likely to win in this category than Best Picture.\u00a0\nWho do we want to win? With Gerwig out of the running, it'd again be nice to see Bong Joon-ho win outside of the International Feature Film category.\u00a0\nBest Actor Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tAntonio Banderas (Pain and Glory)\n\u2022\tLeonardo DiCaprio (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)\n\u2022\tAdam Driver (Marriage Story)\n\u2022\tJoaquin Phoneix (Joker)\n\u2022\tJonathan Pryce (The Two Popes)\nWhere else would you find the Pope in competition with The Joker? Jonathan Pryce has attracted plenty of buzz for his convincing outing as Pope Francis (a role he was arguably destined to play), while Pedro Almod\u00f3var traditionally coaxes a great performance out of Antonio Banderas. After Joker pushed the boundaries of what a comic-book movie can do, however, it would be a brave person who bets against Joaquin Phoenix following up his 2005 victory for Walk the Line.\nWho do we think will win? It's a toss-up between Adam Driver - equally charismatic, whether he's ruling the galaxy or dealing with divorce in Marriage Story - or Joaquin Phoenix's chillingly unhinged performance in Joker. Phoenix won the Golden Globe, though, which makes him feel like the more likely winner. \u00a0\nWho do we want to win? Adam Driver's sensitive performance in Marriage Story shows what a superstar he really is. No wonder directors are trying to cast him in everything.\u00a0\nBest Actress Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tCynthia Erivo (Harriet)\n\u2022\tScarlett Johansson (Marriage Story)\n\u2022\tSaorise Ronan (Little Women)\n\u2022\tCharlize Theron (Bombshell)\n\u2022\tRen\u00e9e\u00a0Zellweger (Judy)\nThe shortlist here could've been five entries longer this year than it is. The nominations are a mix of up-and-comers (Cynthia Erivo), genuine A-listers (Scarlett Johansson) and regular Oscar contenders (Saoirse Ronan, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Charlize Theron). Let battle commence!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWho do we think will win? Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's performance as Judy Garland feels like the Hollywood choice (indeed, she won the Golden Globe) but after Johansson's emotionally powerful performance in Marriage Story, who knows?\nWho do we want to win? This would be a fourth Oscar nomination for Saoirse Ronan by the age of 25 - she probably won't win this year, but surely her time must come soon, as it did for Kate Winslet. \u00a0\nBest Supporting Actor Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tTom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood)\n\u2022\tAnthony Hopkins (The Two Popes)\n\u2022\tAl Pacino (The Irishman)\n\u2022\tJoe Pesci (The Irishman)\n\u2022\tBrad Pitt (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)\nThis category is traditionally a Lifetime Achievement Award by stealth, and never has that been more true than this year, when the shortlist is entirely composed of bona fide Hollywood legends. In fact, the only one of our quintet yet to get their hands on a golden statue is Brad Pitt - and that may just work in his favor...\nWho do we think will win? With The Irishman vote likely to be split between Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and The Two Popes both likely to be Oscar night outsiders, the stars are aligning for Brad Pitt (who arguably gave his best performance in the last year in Ad Astra, rather than Once Upon a Time).\u00a0\nWho do we want to win? Brad Pitt's laconic stuntman was one of the best things about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and few could begrudge him an Academy Award as reward for an impressive career.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBest Supporting Actress Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tKathy Bates (Richard Jewell)\n\u2022\tLaura Dern (Marriage Story)\n\u2022\tScarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit)\n\u2022\tFlorence Pugh (Little Women)\n\u2022\tMargot Robbie (Bombshell)\nUnlike its male counterpart, our nominations only feature one previous Oscar winner (Kathy Bates). With a Best Actress nomination already secure, Scarlett Johansson's unlikely to win here against her Marriage Story co-star Laura Dern - though up-and-comer Florence Pugh could be an outside bet.\u00a0\nWho do we think will win? Laura Dern got the Golden Globe in this category, deservedly so for her role as a ruthless lawyer in Marriage Story, so it feels like she's got this.\u00a0\nWho do we want to win? It's hard to believe that it's only seven years since Margot Robbie burst onto the scene in Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. After a string of memorable performances since, her turn as a Fox News producer in Bombshell could launch her into the elite. \u00a0\nBest Original Screenplay Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tKnives Out\n\u2022\tMarriage Story\n\u2022\t1917\n\u2022\tOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\u2022\tParasite\nThis category may be the best chance of a win for Best Picture contenders Marriage Story and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but they won't get it all their own way. \u00a0Rian Johnson's Knives Out is a wonderfully sharp whodunnit, and you can't rule out a clean sweep for 1917.\nWho do we think will win? Seeing as Hollywood traditionally loves movies about itself, expect Quentin Tarantino to pick up his third writing Oscar for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - especially if he doesn't win for Best Picture.\nWho do we want to win? The compelling and frequently hilarious mystery of Knives Out deserves this, to make up for being snubbed in the other major categories.\u00a0\nBest Adapted Screenplay Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tThe Irishman\n\u2022\tJojo Rabbit\n\u2022\tJoker\n\u2022\tLittle Women\n\u2022\tThe Two Popes\nAnother category that has a strong Netflix contingent, with The Two Popes (adapted by Anthony McCarten from his own play) up against The Irishman, Steven Zaillian's take on I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. Little Women gives it strong competition, although we'd be very surprised if Joker is the winner here compared to other categories.\u00a0\nWho do we think will win? If The Irishman doesn't win in other categories, expect it to pick up an award here.\nWho do we want to win? Given that Greta Gerwig didn't get the Best Director nod for Little Women, this would be a well deserved consolation.\u00a0\nBest Animated Feature\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tHow to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World\n\u2022\tI Lost My Body\n\u2022\tKlaus\n\u2022\tMissing Link\n\u2022\tToy Story 4\nDisney is likely to take this prize home, though it's a surprise that Frozen 2 didn't get a nomination. Netflix enters the fray with with Christmas-themed Klaus and the leftfield I Lost My Body, while Laika (the company behind Paranorman and the sublime Kubo and the Two Strings) won the Golden Globe with Missing Link. Finally, the latest How to Train Your Dragon completes the nominations. \u00a0\nWho do we think will win? In a clash of the Disney titans, Toy Story 4 seems to have the edge over Frozen II, and maintain Pixar's record of winning the prize, on average, every other year. That said, Laika won with Missing Link at the Golden Globes, so it has a shot.\u00a0\nWho do we want to win? While it would be nice to show some love to an unconventional newbie like I Lost My Body, Toy Story 4 was such a perfect end to a wonderful saga that the heart belongs to Woody and Buzz.\u00a0\nBest Score Oscar predictions\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u2022\tHildur\u00a0Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir (Joker)\n\u2022\tAlexandre Desplat (Little Women)\n\u2022\tRandy Newman (Marriage Story)\n\u2022\tThomas Newman (1917)\n\u2022\tJohn Williams (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker)\nTraditionally one of the hardest categories to call\u00a0- yes, every category in the Oscars is subjective, but the success of a score is so down to personal taste that it's incredibly difficult to second guess what Oscar voters will go for. There's an absurd level of composer royalty going on in this category.\nWho do we think will win? He's just completed the score for the ninth movie in a saga he began in 1977 with the original Star Wars - don't be surprised if this turns into a lifetime achievement award (and fifth Oscar win) for the 87-year-old John Williams for The Rise of Skywalker.\u00a0\nWho do we want to win? Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir is the only newcomer on the list, but her foreboding, string-heavy Joker score added to the uneasy, grimy atmosphere of an unsettling movie.\u00a0Plus she won the Golden Globe.\u00a0\nBest International Feature Film Oscar predictions\n\u2022\tCorpus Christi\n\u2022\tHoneyland\n\u2022\tLes Mis\u00e9rables\n\u2022\tPain and Glory\n\u2022\tParasite\nThe fact that there's no requirement for Academy voters to have watched every foreign language movie in contention arguably has a larger effect on this category than any other - most of the releases won't have received a wide release in the United States, so won't be in the general consciousness. That means that - even with a pre-released 10-movie shortlist to work from - the more famous, most-talked about movies are at a big advantage. That's surely going to work in favour of Parasite, which is also nominated for Best Picture among other categories.\u00a0\nWho do we think will win? It's already won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, has received brilliant reviews and is on the shortlist for Best Picture - it's impossible to look past Parasite.\u00a0\nWho do we want to win? Parasite would be a worthy winner, but seeing as the consistently brilliant Pedro Almod\u00f3var won his only Oscar 20 years ago (for All About My Mother), it feels like a second - for Pain & Glory -\u00a0is long overdue."}, {"text": "With most of the top categories long locked in, if there was any real drama in the 92nd Oscars on Sunday it was how well another year of no host would fare.\nNot so great turned out to be the answer for Hollywood and ABC after the more than three-hour-long ceremony.\nAfter the novelty of last year's forced lack of a host after the Kevin Hart fiasco, this year seemed to hope going hostless again would hide the cracks in a show produced by Lynette Howell Taylor and Stephanie Allain that had nothing much new to say on Tinseltown's biggest night. Hope sometime can't close the deal, sorry to say.\nYes, with 1917 left out of the party, it was certainly a big and historic night for Parasite and director Bong Joon Ho. Major acting category wins went to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's       \u00a0    Brad Pitt, Marriage Story's       \u00a0    Laura Dern, Joker's earnest       \u00a0    Joaquin Phoenix and Judy's Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. Certainly, no one who loves movies could stay dry-eyed at the lovely standing ovation for \"our great       \u00a0    Martin Scorsese,\" prompted by Bong       \u00a0    in his Best Director acceptance speech at the Dolby Theater.\nHowever, with relatively little to shock in the big categories, if your big surprise of the night is bringing an album-peddling Eminem back to belt out his 75th Academy Awards-winning Best Original Song \"Lose Yourself\" and it was the night's first standing ovation at past the 90-minute mark, you have a problem - and I love Mr. Marshall Mathers and that 8 Mile tune.\nPeddling the same choir book as last year's Oscars produced by Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss, with as much music to almost rival a half-hearted Grammys, and throwback montages to the songs of past cinema, the 2020 Oscars bellowed out for a ringmaster to harness what soon became a lackluster circus. Bested early on by multiple Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais in      \u00a0    his online mocking Sunday, the low point on a night of many dips had to be Randy Newman back on that Toy Story beat with a tune that appears to have taken just over twice as long to write as it took to perform.\nOscars: Wins By Film & Studio\nStarting off with a high-octane glamapalooza of Harriet star Janelle Mon\u00e1e with Billy Porter and Best Picture-garbed dancers blasting out the Mister Rogers theme and a slew of Hollywood classics while going right into the crowd at the Dolby, the show looked like a winner.\nStrolling out past hosts Steve Martin and Chris Rock out for a second consecutive hostless Oscars seemed like another smart play. Until the first Iowa Caucuses joke and audience shout-outs started with nominee Pitt, two-time winner Mahershala Ali and a string of lame swings at Jeff Bezos' expense. With those opening minutes fading fast in the creative twilight, it was then back to the future, in the most toothless way.\nThe fact is the immensely talented Martin and Rock were the hosts for all practical purposes with their pretty standard opening monologue - parts of which the latter supposedly practiced on an L.A. comedy stage Saturday night. In a predictable night of anticipated winners, Martin and Rock's blunted jabs at the sorrowful lack of women nominated in the Directing category and Harriet's Cynthia Erivo as the solo person of color nominated in the top acting categories would sadly have stood the test of almost any Oscars the past few years. Yet, the reality is the comics had little new to say for 2020, a year that was screaming out for relevance and opportunity.\nTo bring out ex-SNL duos like Bridesmaids co-stars Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig or Downhill's Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell and have them caught in a leg-hold trap of bad writing and clear network time-killing is a sin on any Sunday, but especially Oscar night. To remind us just how bad Cats was, James Corden's and Rebel Wilson's appearance in full furry regalia was the wind blowing through the awards shows graveyard of irrelevance. The fact that no one had the guts to even utter the words Harvey Weinstein, his victims or the fight of the #MeToo movement and Time's Up with the once powerful and now much accused producer currently on trial for rape in New York City right now only made Gervais' scathing words nearly lost at the end of the Golden Globes last month more biting.\nWhich means, at some point soon, if God is just in her Heaven, what constitutes an award show will have to meet the wrecking ball and be rebuilt. That effort of renewal will require much more than having or not having a host because of controversy, incompetence or hope of another ratings bounce. Sure, the way-too-long Oscars of tonight wasn't as much of a cluster as the Democrats' efforts to secure delegates in the Hawkeye State on February 3, but America's storytellers should know better to do so much better by now.\nWith another winning speech this awards season, Pitt's Best Supporting Actor win for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood saw a swing at the stunted impeachment of Donald Trump and the brakes Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP put on witnesses such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Capping an impressive awards-season streak, a near birthday celebrating Dern brought the competitive crowd even further to her side with shout-outs to her heroes, her parents Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern.\nStill, not even an Oscar-winning Elton John coming out in the last half hour to semi-fulfill the classic rock role that a semi-reunited Queen blasted out last year could hit the high notes that tonight needed.\nIn a show that drew heavily from Broadway's new talents and Zazie Beetz and hence had way more inclusion onstage than in the actual nominations, ads like past winner Regina King for Cadillac; Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, James Cameron, Kathryn Bigelow and Scorsese for Rolex; and a preview of the masterful Erivo in Nat Geo's Genius: Aretha offered a fresher take, and a more direct one, literally and figuratively.\nAnd when the ads are the real stars, you really have a really serious problem Oscar - host or not.

Then we waited one more year for a Korean film to win the Golden Palm and subsequently open in Cyprus cinemas \u2013 but it happens this week with Parasite. (We\u2019ll actually have to wait a few more days; the film opens on Thursday at the Pantheon, with Greek and English subtitles.) The two films have more than a top festival award and geographical proximity in common. Both revolve around a slightly disreputable \u2013 but very close-knit \u2013 family of hustlers, though the tone is admittedly quite different. Shoplifters was cosy, humane, and a little bit staid; Parasite is a sharply satirical, highly enjoyable thriller with a good deal of swagger, if perhaps slightly hollow.\n\u201cThis is so metaphorical,\u201d young Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) says more than once \u2013 and I guess it is, though it\u2019s also rather blatant. Ki-woo and his family, the Kims, are the titular parasites, not just leeching off a wealthy family \u2013 the Parks \u2013 but caught in a symbiotic relationship: the Parks support the Kims, lifting them out of their squalid unemployed existence in a semi-basement flat, but in fact the Parks are happy to do it, blissfully unaware that their driver, their housekeeper, their daughter\u2019s tutor and their son\u2019s \u2018art therapist\u2019 all belong to the same family. \u201cThey smell the same!\u201d says the little boy, picking up that semi-basement reek, but his parents are embarrassed. They\u2019re parasites too, in a way, living empty lives off the backs of ordinary people.\nIt takes about 45 minutes for the scam to be set up, which is arguably too long. There\u2019s a slightly laboured quality to the first act \u2013 though it gives us a chance to meet the Parks, hard-nosed Mr. Park who\u2019s mostly fair-minded but doesn\u2019t like his staff \u201ccrossing the line\u201d and weak, rather gullible Mrs. Park, twittering on about her son\u2019s artistic genius (\u201cHe has a Basquiat-esque sense, even at age 9!\u201d). \u201cShe\u2019s rich, but still nice,\u201d marvels Mr. Kim later (he\u2019s played by Song Kang-ho, probably the best-known of all Korean actors), but his wife disagrees: \u201cNice because she\u2019s rich,\u201d she corrects, adding that \u201cmoney is an iron\u201d, it takes out the creases. The Parks keep neuroses primly hidden, living on a hilltop and basking in the sunshine in their front garden; the Kims laugh and argue and live underground, with the rest of the basement-dwellers.\nThere\u2019s a twist, of course, which I won\u2019t spoil here. Director Bong Joon-ho dealt with class struggle before, in Snowpiercer, though in that film, which was set on a train, the physical divide was horizontal (front/back) whereas here it\u2019s vertical (up/down). The only real question is where Parasite goes after establishing that divide \u2013 and it\u2019s fair to say that it goes into anarchy, working-class solidarity turning out to be a chimera. A rain falls, the Kims\u2019 seedy neighbourhood turned into waterlogged chaos (there\u2019s a striking, orange-filtered shot of the dank Dickensian warren criss-crossed by cables; the very opposite of the clean lines in the Parks\u2019 comfy home), then Mr. Kim \u2013 asked by his son what the plan is \u2013 wearily replies that there\u2019s no plan, and that\u2019s how it should be. \u201cPeople shouldn\u2019t make plans. With no plan, nothing can go wrong.\u201d It doesn\u2019t get more hopeless than that.\nParasite goes down easily enough; it doesn\u2019t have the wild shifts of Snowpiercer, though the tone swings from knockabout comedy to shocking violence. Easy to see why such an accomplished movie won the top prize at Cannes (unanimously, too) \u2013 yet pinning it down remains elusive. Why the emphasis on performance (the kids coaching Mr. Kim on what to say, Kim pretending to be mad at his wife)? Is Bong\u2019s point that everyone is acting, that class divisions are assigned roles more than anything? Yet the difference, in the end, boils down to something very visceral \u2013 that aforementioned smell, like \u201cwhen you boil a rag\u201d says Mr. Park, the smell of poverty and damp stuffy homes, the smell of people who go on the subway. It\u2019s as though capitalism \u2013 the wealth gap, our polarised world in general \u2013 has created two different species, warily sniffing at each other in the jungle, able to live together but no longer recognising themselves in the other. Hopefully it\u2019s all metaphorical.\nDIRECTED BY Bong Joon-ho\nSTARRING Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-sik, Park So-dam\nIn Korean, with Greek and English subtitles.\nSouth Korea 2019 132 mins"}, {"text": "South Korean drama Parasite made history on Sunday night, becoming the first foreign language film ever to win Best Picture at the 92nd Oscars. \nThe film has been a critical hit since hitting U.S. theaters in November, with a whopping 99per cent Rotten Tomatoes rating from 393 reviews. And it has earned $165.3 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing South Korean film ever.\nEven so, Parasite only grossed $35.4million in the U.S., so for those who may not be aware of the film, we're taking a deep dive into the historic Oscar winner.\nParasite is the seventh directorial effort of South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, whose previous films include Netflix's Okja (2017), indie thriller Snowpiercer (2014) and monster movie The Host (2006).\nParasite follows two families - the poor basement-dwelling Kim family (Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-sik, Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin) and the wealthy Park family (Lee Sun-kyun, Jo Yeo-jeong and Jung Ji-so) - whose lives intersect.\nThe Kim family infiltrate the lives of the Parks, first with the children becoming tutors for the wealthy offspring, before their scheming leads to the Kim matriarch and patriarch finding work in the household.\nThe film shows how both families serve as 'parasites' in different ways, with the Kims latching onto the Park's wealth, while the Parks exploit the Kims for cheap labor.\n'Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant,' Bong said in an interview (via IGN).\n'But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites,' the directed added.\nThe filmmaker largely found inspiration for Parasite in his own experiences in his 20s, when he worked as a tutor for a wealthy family.\nDirector Bong told The Hollywood Reporter that he was introduced to the wealthy family by his girlfriend and future wife Jung Sun-young, who was already tutoring the family's son in English, but needed a math tutor.\n'They wanted another tutor for math, so she put me forward as a trustworthy friend, even though I was actually really bad at math,' Bong said.\nThe filmmaker was also inspired by French sisters Christine and Lea Papin, French maids who murdered their employers in 1930s France.\nProduction took place between May 2018 and September 2018, largely within a massive house created and built for the film by production designer Lee Ha Jun. \n'They want to show off that they have this sophisticated taste,' Bong told Architectural Digest in a profile about the sprawling house built for the film.\nParasite had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where it became the first Korean film ever to win the top award at the festival, the prestigious Palme d'Or.\nIt was also the first film to be unanimously selected as the Palme d'Or by the Cannes jury since 2013's Blue is the Warmest Color.\nThe film was released in South Korea on May 30, where it became the highest-grossing film ever in its native country. \nParasite was released in the United States on October 11 in limited release, where it received rave reviews and became the first South Korean film ever to be nominated for Best International Feature Film.\nThe movie earned a whopping $392,216 in its U.S. opening weekend from just three theaters for a per-screen average of $131,072, the highest ever for a foreign-language film.\nDespite a rather limited rollout, only expanding into over 1,000 theaters until late January, Parasite has still earned $35.4 million at the domestic box office. \nParasite was nominated for six Oscars, winning four - Best Picture (producers Kwak Sin-ae Kwak, Bong Joon-ho), Best Director (Bong Joon-ho), Best Original Screenplay (Bong Joon-ho, Jin Wan-han) and Best International Feature Film.\nIt also became the first foreign language film to win Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and just the second film to win the Palm d'Or and Best Picture, since Marty in 1955.\nAmong its other accolades are Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay at the BAFTAs and Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes."}, {"text": "Could South Korean director Bong Joon-ho\u2019s wickedly incisive black comedy Parasite lift the 2020 \u201cBest Foreign Language Film\u201d at the Academy Awards in February \u2013 or even the \u201cBest Picture\u201d Oscar?\nThe odds are steep. A handful of Japanese and one Taiwanese film have won the former title, but Parasite would be the first non-English-language film ever to win the latter category. Still,\u00a0signs are promising. On Sunday, Parasite topped off a rich awards season that includes aCannes Palme D'Or by becoming the first foreign-language film ever to win a       \u00a0    Screen Actor's Guild ensemble prize\u00a0\u2013 analogous to the Oscar's \"Best Picture\" honor.\nRegardless of win or loss, the fact that an Asian work is in contention for the English-speaking world\u2019s most prestigious film award suggests Asia\u2019s soft power is finally catching up with its hard power:\u00a0 In terms of economic clout, East Asia is on a par with the EU and North America.\nSince World War II, Asia-specific genres \u2013 city-crushing monsters, swashbuckling samurai, kung fu fighters, dreamy animes \u2013 have both enriched and influenced global cinema. Asian filmmakers have packed US mainstream theaters with actioners and art houses with quality films; a handful of Asian actors have won global icon status.\nBut US acceptance has been a long time coming.\nAsians suffered from racial stereotypes, watched white actors don \u201cyellowface\u201d and are now seeing \u201cwhitewashing\u201d of not just Asian characters, but entire movies. Asian films have been impacted by dire dubbing and the curse of the subtitle. Prejudice has impacted actors and auteurs.\nNow, as digitization hurdles both national and cultural frontiers, and as new forms of distribution come online, there are realistic hopes for a better tomorrow.\nIn 2000, \u00a0Ang Lee\u2019s Chinese fantasia Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon dissolved the barrier between critical and mainstream acceptance for a defiantly all-Asian film \u2013 complete with Asian actors, themes, aesthetics and subtitles \u2013 by bagging four Oscars.\nTwo decades later, Parasite\u2019ssix nominations indicate Americans are open to non-genre Asian films. The movie, though Asia-set, addresses a universal issue: middle-class angst amid income polarization. And signs are promising that it could seize the big one.\nWith Parasite on the brink of the\u00a0biggest-ever success for Asian cinema in the Anglophone hyperpower that hosts the world\u2019s mightiest film industry, Asia Times reviews the trials, tribulations and triumphs of Asian film in Hollywood.\n\u2022\tMaestro Bong Joon-ho's Parasite\u00a0is Asia's best-ever chance for a best picture Oscar. Video: YouTube\n\u00a0\u2018Yellow peril\u2019 and \u2018yellow face\u2019\nAlmost entirely forgotten today, one of the first heartthrobs of Hollywood\u2019s silent era was Kintaro Hakakawa (1886-1973). A Japanese-American, he wielded a brooding set of good looks that swept him through decades of film following his 1915 debut The Cheat.\n\u201cHistorically, Hollywood framed Asians within the \u2018Yellow Peril\u2019 framework and Asians were not considered for leading roles,\u201d Aaron Han Joon Magnan-Park, a film expert at the University of Hong Kong told Asia Times. \u201cHayakawa was an exception to this\u2026.his ancestry made him not completely \u2018yellow\u2019 since Japan was the only imperial power within the 'white-only club' following victory in the Russo-Japanese War.\u201d\nIt would be decades before another Asian would enjoy such a positive profile on US screens.\nIn a century that saw Asian colonies demand (and win) independence from European powers, and battle Western soldiers in a trio of murderous East Asian wars, the \u201cYellow Peril\u201d became a 20th-century\u00a0Western fear. It was reflected in cinematic representations that are, by 21st century standards, damningly prejudiced.\n\u2022\tWhite man, beware! A (not very Asian) Fu Manchu is up to no good. Video: YouTube.\nMost notorious was the Fu Manchu series, based on the novels by Edwardian Sax Rohmer. The series, which flourished in both the 1930s and the 1960s, featured a Chinese super-villain whose army of assassins \u2013 comprising Arabs, Chinese and Indians \u2013 deployed such nefarious weapons as venomous snakes, poisonous spiders and plague bacilli.\nReinforcing the un-reality of the series, the villain was not played by an Asian, but by white actors \u2013 notably, horror movie stalwarts Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee \u2013 made up to look vaguely Asian. This practice of \u201cyellowface\u201d would rob Asian actors of countless roles.\nWhite actors played one of the few positive Asian characters of 1930s Hollywood \u2013 Chinese detective Charlie Chan \u2013 but the most notorious example of yellowface was a 1956 film portraying history\u2019s most powerful Asian \u2013 one who had generated centuries of European folk memory of real \u201cyellow peril.\u201d In Howard Hughes\u2019 The Conqueror,Genghis Khan, played by Hollywood veteran John Wayne, stormed across Utah. The so-called \"Oriental Western\" today generates both bitterness and ridicule and is a staple on \"Worst Films of all Time\u201d lists.\n\u2022\tGenghis Khan as gunslinger: John Wayne in 'The Conqueror.' Video: YouTube.\ns\nNot all Asians were portrayed as perilous. In 1958, Mickey Rooney placed a doltish, buck-toothed and myopic Japanese photographer in Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s; 13 years after the atomic bomb had detonated, Hollywood was still producing World War II-style ethnic caricatures. Rooney\u2019s character, \u201cMr. Yunioshi,\u201d became such an icon of racial offensiveness that in a 2008 newspaper interview, Rooney apologized.\nNone of these portrayals were products of Asian cinema \u2013 and by the 1950s, far-sighted Western viewers were starting to look toward the real East.\nSwashbuckling samurai, city-stomping monsters\nIn 1952, a motion picture featuring a compelling plot, forceful characters, brilliant actors, superb lighting and roving camerawork hit Tokyo screens. Today, it is considered one of the greatest films of all time, its director one of the greatest auteurs ever.\n\u2022\tThe ultimatechanbara: Seven Samurai. Video: YouTube\ns\nThe film opened overseas eyes to Japan\u2019s chanbara(\u201csword-fighting\u201d) cinema. Other Kurosowa chanbaraclassics include 1950\u2019s Rashomon (winner of the\u201cBest Foreign Language Film\u201d Oscar in 1952), Throne of Blood (1957) and\u00a0Yojimbo (1961).\u00a0Other\u00a0chanbarawould win niche Western audiences, notably the Zatoichi \u201cBlind Swordsman\u201d movies, the ludicrously bloody \u201cLone Wolf and Cub\u201d series and the kinkier \"Nemuri Kyoshiri/Son of Black Mass\" series.\nBeyond genre film, Kurosawa's mastery of cinematography would be hugely influential. So would his films. Seven Samurai was remade in the US as The Magnificent Seven,\u00a0a classic Western; Yojimbowas remade in Spain as\u00a0A Fistful of Dollars,a classic \u201cspaghetti Western.\u201d The two remakes launched a plethora of Hollywood stars, while the original provided a star vehicle for Toshiro Mifune, who would achieve a modest Hollywood breakthrough.\nA very different Asian star arose in 1954. Ishiro Honda's\u00a0Godzilla (a Japanese portmanteau of whale and gorilla), an irradiated, dinosaur-like sea-dragon, crushed Tokyo under his clawed feet \u2013 then, in a rash of sequels, defended earth from outlandish, invading monsters. The \u201cguy-in-a-rubber monster suit\u201d would became a kitschy, beloved icon of Asian cinema, eventually trampling American cities in a series of remakes that, despite their CGI, lacked the charm of the originals. The franchise has generated 35 films thus far; it is still going strong.\n\u2022\tStand by for a \"tidal wave of terror\" \u2013 it's Godzilla! Video: YouTube\ns\nSamurai were not the only eastern warriors to fascinate American filmgoers. In the 1970s, another Asian combative culture would travel West \u2013 via celluloid.\nRise of the kung fu superhero\nThe 1960s brought counter-culture to the US. A new open-mindedness toward things Asian became visible in cuisine, music and religion \u2013 and martial arts.\nJapan\u2019s judo and karate, and Korea\u2019s taekwondo, globalized in the 1950s and 1960s , partly due to American servicemen learning them in Asia and their promotion as combat sports. China\u2019s secretive kung fu would win fame not via sport but via cinema.\nThe 1970s birthed not just a new genre, but the first-ever Third World superstar. Hong Kong\u2019s Bruce Lee came to America in 1959. Personally charismatic, he taught kung fu to Hollywood professionals who recognized his potential.\nLee\u2019s contacts won him TV bit parts \u2013 notably as the white hero\u2019s high-kicking sidekick in The Green Hornet\u00a0\u2013 but his hopes of being the hero of a series about a Shaolin monk wandering the 19th century American West were dashed: He was considered \u201ctoo Asian\u201d for the role. (It went to US actor David Carradine, who \u2013 despite his inability at martial arts \u2013 made it his own in the TV series Kung Fu.)\nLee returned to Hong Kong to leverage his Green Hornet fame in a newly thriving film scene. In 1972, the Shaw Brothers kung fu film Five Fingers of Death had taken the top spot at the American box office \u2013 the first foreign film to achieve the feat, Magnan-Park noted. Shaw had set up cinemas in Chinatowns worldwide, and from thence, kung fu films went global.\n\u2022\tFive Fingers of Death kicked off the global kung fu movie boom. Video: YouTube\ns\nIn Hong Kong, Lee made three superior kung fu flicks for Raymond Chow\u2019s new Golden Harvest studios. They outdid their contemporaries by showcasing Lee\u2019s martial skills, ripped physique and undeniable charisma. Hollywood took note. Lee got the call.\nThe result was 1973\u2019s Hong Kong-Hollywood co-production Enter the Dragon. Combining Lee, black and white co-stars, a Hong Kong location and US production values, it was an instant global hit, one of the finest action films ever.\nAt a stroke, Lee had demolished stereotypes.\nPreviously, \u201cAsian men were presented either as lecherous villains, emasculated into sexual non-entities or allowed to be the good racial sidekick to the white alpha male hero,\u201d said Magnan-Park. \u201cAll this changed with Bruce Lee.\u201d\n\u201cBruce Lee was the tipping point,\u201d agreed Michael Hurt,\u00a0 Social Science Korea research professor at the Center for Glocal Culture and Social Empathy at the University of Seoul. \u201cThe representation of Asians shifted away from passive and sexless to a kind of hyper-masculine manly mode \u2013 he was a kung fu badass.\u201d\nBut Lee never enjoyed superstardom; he died, aged 32, of a brain aneurism, pre-release. Early death enshrined him in legend. To this day, he is recognized worldwide as the 20th century\u2019s greatest Asian cultural icon.\n\u2022\tEnter the Dragon: Kung fu lands in Hollywood. Video: YouTube\ns\nA handful of copycats came and went before \u201cthe next Bruce Lee\u201d emerged.\nJackie Chan had been an extra in Enter the Dragon, but he \u2013 along with Chinese Opera chums Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao \u2013 did not follow Lee\u2019s macho formula. Instead, Chan blended zany slapstick and jaw-dropping physical stunt work to kung fu, conveying the genre triumphantly into the 1980s. His fame would lead to a series of Hong Kong-Hollywood co-productions in the 1990s and 2000s.\nOther martial arts stars would follow: China\u2019s Jet Li, Thailand\u2019s Tony Jaa, Indonesia\u2019s Iko Uwais and Chinese-American Donnie Yen. Women, too, would get their kicks, notably Malaysia\u2019s Michelle Yeoh and China\u2019s Zhang Ziyi.\nHuman waves\u00a0\nFollowing the positive developments in Asian cinema in 1970s, there was a backlash in Hollywood portrayals of Asians in the US as the decade wound down.\nBetween the 1940s and 1970s, American troops discovered Asians could fight. The enemy was racially demonized: The \u201cJaps\u201d (World War II), the \u201cChinks\u201d and \u201cGooks\u201d (Korea) and the \u201cDinks\u201d (Vietnam). The latter became filmic whipping boys as the US wrestled with post-traumatic Vietnam distress.\n\u201cAsians became reduced to their most simplistic forms,\u201d said Hurt. \u201cSimplistic cartoon characters \u2013 in simplistic revenge fantasies.\u201d\nAsians were largely invisible in the best Vietnam pictures, such as Platoon(1986) and Apocalypse Now(1979).\u00a0In others, such as The Deer Hunter (1978) they were deeply villainous. In others, they were mere cannon fodder \u2013 notably in Slyvester Stallone\u2019s Rambo(1985), in which the righteous white hero refights (and wins) the Vietnam War.\nIn a similar vein, an actor incubated by Bruce Lee \u2013 American karate champion Chuck Norris \u2013 avenged his death at Lee\u2019s hands in the climactic duel in Way of the Dragon (1972) by mowing down hordes of yellow and brown extras in a series of 1980s and 1990s B-movies.\n\u2022\tPrepare to die, hundreds of Asian extras \u2013 Chuck Norris is on set. Video: YouTube\ns\nA new hero/villain also emerged: the ninja. The shadow assassins of feudal Japan clearly fascinated US audiences, but the sub-genre lacked a Kurosawa or Lee; the leading ninja actor, Sho Kosugi, never elevated the genre above shlock.\nMeanwhile, Hong Kong cinema was shifting. Highly stylized, noir gangster flicks, borrowing from chanbara, kung fu and Sam Peckinpah's appeared. Blending expertly choreographed, ultra-violent, slow-motion gunplay with emotively melodramatic plots, this was the \u201cheroic bloodshed\u201d or \u201cgun fu\u201d genre.\nA Better Tomorrow\u00a0(1986), 1987'sA Better Tomorrow 2 and 1989\u2019s The Killer brought a new Asian star, Alain Delon-ish Chow Yun Fat, and a new Asian director, John Woo, to global attention. Both would transition to Hollywood.\n\u2022\tStyle, melodrama, body count: A Better Tomorrow II.

Here's at look at what they are and where to find them.\nFor Oscar viewers eager to catch up with Bong Joon Ho's ''Parasite,'' the first-ever non-English-language film to win Best Picture, the timing could not be better for streaming, because it's just become available for rental. In fact, save for ''Little Women,'' ''1917'' and ''Bombshell,'' which only won in technical categories, every Oscar winner is currently streaming for a fee in digital media stores or on subscription services, and two of the three shorts are posted for free on YouTube. Bong's twisty genre hybrid about a con that metastasizes into class warfare should be a priority, but it will be easier than usual to find out if the Academy got it right. \n  'Parasite'\n  Won for: Best picture, director, original screenplay, international feature\n  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  An underclass family infiltrates the home of a much wealthier clan in Bong Joon Ho's impeccably orchestrated allegory about social inequality, which mixes and matches black comedy, social satire and the white-knuckle tension of a thriller. The less known about the plot, the better, given the escalating series of twists that Bong pulls off as the lives of his characters become more closely intertwined. His willingness to play with different genres and tones will be familiar to fans of his previous work, like ''The Host'' and ''Snowpiercer,'' but rarely have they been more smoothly integrated.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Joker'\n  Won for: Best actor, original score\n  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  Films based on DC Comics have tended to go darker than their Marvel counterparts, but ''Joker'' goes one step further, dispensing of the standard conflicts between hero and villain in favor of a deeper sociological bent. Anchored by Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck, a part-time clown and full-time mope who lives with his ailing mother in Gotham City, the film grafts the urban alienation of Martin Scorsese's ''Taxi Driver'' and ''The King of Comedy'' onto the origin story of DC's most famous villain. Where Heath Ledger's Joker in ''The Dark Knight'' reflects a broken system, Phoenix's Joker is the product of it.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Judy'\n  Won for: Best actress\n  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  The Academy loves a splashy biopic performance, and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger locks into a doozy in Judy Garland, the transcendently gifted singer and actress whose triumphs on stage and screen were darkened by mental health issues and substance abuse. Rather than cover the full scope of her life, ''Judy'' focuses on her last year, when Garland's sour reputation in America brings her to London in 1968. There, her efforts to revive her career are undermined by her persistent addiction. Zellweger captures both her vulnerably and her volatility as she struggles to put on one last great show.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood'\n  Won for: Best supporting actor, production design\n  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  When it was announced that Quentin Tarantino was going to make a film about Charles Manson and the Sharon Tate murders, surely no one expected anything like ''Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,'' which builds to that fateful night on Cielo Drive, but approaches it from a side angle. Through the fictional characters of the fading Western star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his faithful stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), Tarantino revivifies Hollywood in the summer of '69 and captures its turbulent undercurrents with the sensitivity of a seismograph. Before the inevitable spasms of violence, the film is a bittersweet elegy for the end of an era.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Marriage Story'\n  Won for: Best supporting actress\n  Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n  Divorce has colored the life and work of the writer-director Noah Baumbach, and he brings all that experience to bear on ''Marriage Story,'' a comedy-drama about the agonies and possibilities of uncoupling. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are both superb as a creative couple who cannot come to terms amicably on their own, so they engage in an emotionally and financially costly legal dispute. Baumbach makes an enemy of the process, which brings out the worst in both of them, but even the lawyers have a human dimension, especially Laura Dern as a powerful L.A. attorney who approaches the job with empathy and aggression.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Jojo Rabbit'\n  Won for: Best adapted screenplay\n  Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  Turning Adolf Hitler into a little boy's imaginary friend sounds like an unworkable conceit, but Taika Waititi's nervy crowd-pleaser treats Der F\u00fchrer as a Beatles-like phenomenon that whipped young people like Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) into a nationalist frenzy. Jojo's time in a Hitler Youth camp is like watching ''Moonrise Kingdom'' with Nazis, but Waititi undercuts the absurdity by detailing the boy's relationship with a Jewish girl his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has hidden behind his bedroom walls. In the battle for his conscience, Hitler proves to be a formidable adversary.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'American Factory'\n  Won for: Best documentary\n  Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix.\n  When the Chinese glass company Fuyao reopens a Dayton, Ohio factory that once housed General Motors, many former G.M. employees return to the work force with the hope of renewed prosperity and cross-cultural harmony. The filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar are present for that optimistic moment and they stay through the difficulties that follow, as differences in work ethic, employee safety and compensation open up a rift between Chinese management and disgruntled American line workers. The promise and peril of this globalist experiment is evoked through Reichert and Bognar's compassionate eye.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Toy Story 4'\n  Won for: Best animated feature\n  Where to watch: Stream it on Disney Plus. Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  The breakout character in this Pixar sequel is Forky, a humble and dimwitted little spork with pipe-cleaner arms, misaligned googly eyes and Popsicle sticks for feet. He's a charming creation who doubles a signal for the low-stakes ambition of ''Toy Story 4,'' which includes the expected Rube Goldberg set pieces and heartstring-tugging of the previous three, but feels more like a stand-alone adventure. Here Woody and the gang are waylaid at a carnival, where they reunite with Little Bo Peep, but have to face the possibility that life may send them on separate destinies.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Hair Love'\n  Won for: Best animated short\n  Where to watch: Stream it on YouTube.\n  From Kickstarter phenomenon to Oscar winner, ''Hair Love,'' directed by Matthew A. Cherry, Everett Downing Jr. and Bruce W. Smith, is about nothing more than a black father struggling to style his daughter's seemingly untamable hair. But within that simple premise, played for equal parts whimsy and sentiment, the movie tells a story about black confidence and identity as well as the rewarding hard work of parenthood. Father and daughter don't say a word to each other. They don't need to.\n  [Read a feature article on the film.]\n  'The Neighbor's Window'\n  Won for: Best live-action short\n  Where to watch: Stream it on YouTube.\n  After three nominations for documentary Oscars -- including one for ''Street Fight,'' about a young Cory Booker's insurgent campaign for mayor of Newark -- the director Marshall Curry finally wins one for a tight piece of short fiction that uses a ''Rear Window'' scenario to reflect on a rocky marriage. Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller star as the beleaguered parents of young children who naturally get jealous when a good-looking, amorous couple moves into the building across the street and doesn't bother to put up drapes. But that grass-is-greener feeling dissipates as the strangers they're watching turn out to have more complicated lives than they initially believe.\n  [Read the New York Times review of the Oscar nominated shorts.]\n  'Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl)'\n  Won for: Best documentary short\n  Where to watch: Stream it on Hulu.\n  Founded in 2007, the nonprofit organization Skateistan has included skateboarding as part of a larger educational mission to serve disadvantaged children in Afghanistan, South Africa and Cambodia, 50% of them girls. Carol Dysinger's 40-minute documentary short narrows the focus to Kabul, Afghanistan, where a brutal patriarchy has persisted after the Taliban. Many girls are denied access to schools and face restrictive and often violent conditions at home. At a secure facility, they're taught how to read and write, but as the title promises, there are skateboarding lessons, too, intended to empower and delight them.\n  'Ford v. Ferrari'\n  Won for: Best editing, sound editing\n  Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  The ultimate in Dad-friendly entertainment for a Sunday afternoon, James Mangold's muscular gear head drama about the quest for supremacy between automakers in 1966 stays squarely within its lane, banking on nitro-charged racing sequences and old-fashioned star turns by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby, who's commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to build a car fast enough to defeat the dominant Ferrari fleet at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With the volatile Ken Miles (Bale) as his driver, Carroll and his team of engineers put together a winner through hard work, sweat and a lot of spit and bubble gum.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n  'Rocketman'\n  Won for: Best Original Song\n  Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes. Rent it on Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.\n  If this Elton John biopic feels like a more well-engineered piece of craftsmanship than last year's Queen biopic ''Bohemian Rhapsody,'' it might be because Dexter Fletcher, who replaced Bryan Singer as the director of the earlier film late in production, was on board here from the beginning. ''Rocketman'' defies precisely none of the genre's clich\u00e9s, but the ascendence of young Reginald Dwight into the pop legend better known as Elton John is a satisfying arc nonetheless. Taron Egerton's robust lead performance is one reason, but classic singles like ''Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting,'' ''Crocodile Rock'' and ''Your Song'' give it the quality of a jukebox musical.\n  [Read the New York Times review.]\n\u2028https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/movies/oscars-winners-movies-streaming.html\u2028\u2028\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \nPHOTO: Clockwise from top left, scenes from ''Parasite,'' ''Joker,'' ''Marriage Story'' and ''Judy.''

It is utterly marvellous.\nTo be honest, you are better off knowing as little as possible about the film before you go in. Just let the madness unfurl, taking you on a very wild ride.\nIf you don't need persuading with a rundown of the plot, skip ahead a few paragraphs.\nFor those who need a little encouragement, here is what we have to play with. The Kims are a family of four living in poverty in a Seoul basement, contending with people urinating outside their window.\nThey rely on the government to fumigate the streets, so they in turn can leave their window open to get the roaches out of their flat and carry on nicking free wifi from upstairs. It is a grim existence and they are fed up with it.\nWhen an opportunity arises for the son to teach English to the daughter of a rich businessman, they hatch a cunning plan to infiltrate their lives and leech as much as they can.\nThey are grifters, chancers, liars and thieves - and you will root for them every step of the way. In stark contrast, the Parks are super-cool, super-rich and happy but vacant.\nYou don't dislike them but their ambivalence towards the lower classes grates throughout.\nAs the Kims worm their way into the (very cool) house, replacing the staff one by one, you have no clue which way it will play out - and nothing really prepares you for the path it chooses.\n                     BRACE YOURSELF                   \nIt is completely gripping. Director Bong Joon-ho displays incredible dexterity here.\nOn the face of it, this is a farcical black comedy at its centre, with a crispy thriller coating.\nYet it is the social and political statements around the class divide that give it real bite.\nThanks to his incredible track record (he was responsible for the wonderful Okja, for instance) one of the most satisfying elements of this film's success is that it will almost certainly avoid the standard Western remake.\nThis is good news, as its Korean origins are what gives Parasite its sharp edges. In Western culture, we rarely reflect the disparity of the classes in quite the same way.\nThat is not to say it isn't as harsh elsewhere. But the basement-dwelling culture is synonymous with cities such as Seoul.\nAnd for us sanitised Westerners, the unfamiliar surroundings - coupled with the familiar glossy-mag Grand Designs minimalism - really work.\nBelieve the plaudits, get your arse to the cinema and brace yourself for the most entertaining movie of the year.\n                     Parasite (15) 132mins                   \n                     *****"}, {"text": "The 92nd annual Academy Awards quickly lost its own plot amid a million distractions courtesy of ABC's frenetic, often baffling production decisions. But then, through the sheer pleasure of the groundbreaking winners of \"Parasite\" breaking through the expected narrative to triumph, the show became something far more beautifully chaotic than the show's producers could have hoped for.\u00a0\nFor about half the broadcast, the Oscars felt like a train that got jogged off its tracks. With most of the winners seemingly set in stone, ABC packed the night with presenters and performances to distract from what looked to be a predictable night, which only made the proceedings feel more crowded than ever. (In fairness: one aspect outside ABC's control is the fact that this year's original song nominees were especially uninspiring, which the elaborate stagings of every number, as well as bonus performances from artists like Janelle Monae and Billie Eilish, did their best to mask.)\nGoing host-less for the second year running ostensibly puts more pressure on the presenters, some of whom inevitably fared better than others. But the show's emphasis on not just presenters, but (younger) presenters for the (more established) presenters, seriously pushed the limits of what constitutes a high value cameo. I've always wanted to know who networks think they're luring into an awards show broadcast thanks to some star power reading the categories, and this round's especially strange attempts confirm that awards shows are especially prone to the \"more is more\" approach, regardless of logic.\u00a0\nThere's just no reason, for instance, that \"Booksmart\" star Beanie Feldstein shouldn't have presented alongside Mindy Kaling instead of alerting the audience to Kaling's presence. \"1917\" breakout George McKay truly needn't have thrown to Olivia Colman from the tippy top of the Dolby Theater. Most importantly, and perhaps in the most perfect summary of just how bizarre the night got by the halfway mark, who on earth suggested that Anthony Ramos introduce Lin-Manuel Miranda, so Lin-Manuel Miranda could introduce a montage of popular movies and the songs they made famous, which in turn introduced none other than Eminem performing the entirety of his 2002 Oscar-winning song \"8 Mile,\" for no other reason than he didn't get the chance before and that has a new album to promote? By the time Utkarsh Ambudkar was rapping about what had already happened in the ceremony so far, in a tepid reboot of Neil Patrick Harris' go to closing bit for the Tonys, it seemed like the show had completely lost the thread.\u00a0\nBut towards the end of the night, a double whammy of surprise wins changed the tide of the night and show, ABC's forced idea of fun be damned. After picking up Oscars for original screenplay and international feature (and giving two distinctly funny and poignant speeches), a visibly shocked Bong Joon Ho took best director - and then \"      \u00a0    Parasite\" won best picture, becoming the first international feature to ever do so. The rush of joy accompanying each win, Bong's open shock, the room's delight at a supposedly set awards season narrative falling apart in front of their eyes all combined to make the kind of thrilling moments that can only happen on live TV when all the best laid plans have been long left by the wayside. \nThere's maybe no better metaphor for when ABC, no doubt sweating bullets as the show approached its three-and-a-half hour mark, tried to go dark on the winding final speeches from the \"Parasite\" team, only to have the audience (led by front row fanatics Charlize Theron and Tom Hanks) erupt in a chant of \"up! up!\" until the poor control booth relented and put the house lights back on to let the winners finish their thoughts. Unlike James Corden and Rebel Wilson's rambling \"Cats\" banter, this sharp left turn from the expected course of events wasn't exactly in ABC's plans, but it really couldn't have asked for a better finale than it accidentally got. Nothing written in advance could beat the sight of deserving winners basking in their victory while sharing pointed, personal insight on why the wins mean so much.\u00a0\nPut another way: the late-breaking \"Parasite\" run brought the kind of shock to the system and refreshing verve that only a live event like the Oscars can - and after almost three hours of frantic vamping, a downright relief.\u00a0\nMore from Variety\nKorea, Asia Rejoice in 'Parasite' Oscar Wins      \u00a0    Oscars Scorecard 2020: Wins by Studio      \u00a0    Hollywood Celebrates 'Parasite's' Best Picture Oscar: 'Massive!

However, Parasite will premiere at cinemas across the UAE on Thursday, January 16.\nTaking home the biggest prize of the night was 1917, the First World War epic directed by Sam Mendes, who was also named best director for the picture, which is made to look as though it has been filmed in one continuous shot.

It is the first masterpiece in a foreign language film to have won the honour.\nCritics, movie buffs and admirers across the world had waited for this revolutionary acknowledgement for decades and since February 10, they haven't stopped going gaga over the most unexpected surprise of almost a century for the cinematic universe.\nWhile Parasite also won Best International Film, Bong won Best Original Screenplay accolade and Best Director, beating legends such as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Sam Mendes and Todd Phillips.\nAnd why not? Direction-wise, Bong used his directorial skills with prominence, making him worthy of the honour. The by-product of his cast and crews' efforts is no less than a marvel to classic movie lovers. By creating this grand work of art by ticking off all the theoretical yet practical elements of story-telling, he and the film will no doubt go down as an integral part of the movie-making curriculum. Let's not take away the fact that the film indeed fulfilled the basics and key features of filmmaking. Not just this, Joon-ho also seems to well speak the language of cinema - be it Akira Kurosawa's or Alfred Hitchcock's.\nAfter having given birth to K-pop, a whole new genre of music, this may very well be a turning point for Korean Cinema. But is it for movies in general especially when I see Sam Mendes's war epic 1917 NOT being named the Best Picture from the eight other novelty artworks nominated in the same category?\nThe painfully beautiful story of 1917 deserves the tag more than any other film (or equally for those who are emotional about the winner) for the tragic magic the one-shot movie created on screen. The movie running at three paces - visually, mentally and musically, was no short of a slow poison that brings to life hope by the end of it all. Even while playing on screen, 1917 is a reminder of the breakthrough techniques used to make cinema live up-to-date, eventually making it timeless.\nHitting the highest note of cinematic experience, the camera perspective made its audience the biggest part of the story-telling. No credits to that too? It also looked the biggest creation of all times, so far, for it seemed to also be a musical parody like Dunkirk, giving goosebumps sometimes with sound effects alone.\nSurreal yet creepily real, mind-bending and heart orgasmic, 1917 is a tale running against time; there is no reason why this was not better than any of the eight films nominated: Ford v Ferrari, The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit, Joker, Little Women, Marriage Story, 1917, Once Upon A Time In...Hollywood and Parasite, of course.\nEverything apart, what is done is done and if you go by reviews particularly after 1917 was nominated in key Golden Globe categories (because that's exactly when the film's power came to light), there are chances you will believe the movie was worth winning the biggest Oscar.\nBut isn't the timing a little off, say by a year? Flashback to the event ceremony a year ago, when Alfonso Cuaron's Spanish film Roma was the most likely to have won the Best Picture title but lost only to Greenbook, a take on African American racism. Call it political, inclusive or a move to break stereotypes, it seems change is for the better."}, {"text": "Bong Joon-ho's story of the antics of a down-on-their-luck clan as they inveigle themselves into the lives of a wealthy family is an unsettling exploration of greed and class\nParasite (15) ****\n Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) (15) ***\n Dolittle (PG) *\n Bong Joon-ho's Bafta-winning and Oscar-nominated Parasite sees the South Korean genre master return to home territory with a darkly amusing and disturbing social horror film about a fallen-on-hard-times family insinuating themselves into the lives of a much wealthier clan. Swiftly establishing the resourcefulness of its marginalised protagonists, the film's richly metaphorical opening introduces us to the Kim family living a somewhat subterranean existence in a basement apartment where they filch free wi-fi from neighbours and nearby coffee shops and endure the choking fits that come from leaving the windows of their insect-infested home open while the streets above are being fumigated. \n  Scraping together a meagre living folding pizza boxes, their fortunes soon take a turn for the better when the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), bluffs his way into a job as an English language tutor for the teenage daughter of the tech-rich Park family. Exploiting the gullibility of his new employers, Ki-woo's father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin) and sister (Park So-dam) waste no time engineering ways to usurp the Park household's other domestic staff, a task they execute with a ruthless efficiency that's both awful and amusing. \n Here Bong is careful not to demonise or valorise either family; as a filmmaker he's less interested in finger-wagging admonishments than he is in taking us to uncomfortable places with outr\u00e9 plot twists that deepen and reframe what we think we know about the characters. Setting the action mostly within the sleek confines of the Park family's modernist home, he makes great use of the film's location to emphasise the ingrained feelings of superiority and inferiority that exist within his characters. As resentments build and the professionally courteous line between employers and employees is crossed in at first subtle but then shocking ways, what lingers is the way the film's title increasingly refers to the complexities of a world that feeds off the simple dreams of anyone with a vested interest in improving their status and protecting what they've got. \n Of all DC's attempts to create an extended cinematic universe to rival Marvel's, 2016's super-villian team-up Suicide Squad was the worst: a crass slice of corporate edginess that couldn't even capitalise on having the Joker (then played by Jared Leto) in its roster of reprobates. Its one bright spark was Margot Robbie's histrionically unhinged turn as the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, a punky, baseball-bat-wielding psycho wholly subservient to her beau's anarchic worldview. It makes sense, then, that in an effort to keep the franchise going Robbie's character should get her own interim spin-off movie ahead of next year's sequel. (For all its flaws, Suicide Squad still made close to $750m.) As the parenthetically elongated title suggests, Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) is a deliberately over-the-top attempt to make something true to the gonzo spirit of the character as she frees herself from the literal and figurative toxicity of her chemical-plant-forged romance with the Crown Prince of Crime. \n Striking out on her own, Robbie's cackling, kill-crazy kook now finds herself facing a slew of vendetta-hungry criminals no longer worried about reprisals from her ex. Chief among these is Ewan McGregor's campy gangster, Roman Sionis, a sadistic nightclub owner whose bid to take over Gotham City's criminal underworld forces Harley into an uneasy allegiance with a crossbow-wielding assassin (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a hard-bitten cop (Rosie Perez), an ass-kicking nightclub singer (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and a teenage pick-pocket (Ella Jay Basco). Here, newbie director Cathy Yan and Bumblebee screenwriter Christina Hodson give Gotham City a Day-Glo makeover in keeping with their anti-heroine and, likewise, they adopt an insouciant attitude to violence that recalls the self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking style of Deadpool, albeit with shallow comic-book feminism replacing shallow comic-book nihilism. The end result is occasionally entertaining and frequently enervating. \n The 1967 musical version of Dr Dolittle hastened the end of the old studio system. The 1998 comedy version gave Eddie Murphy's career a second wind. The most notable thing about the new Robert Downey Jr version is the Iron Man star's decision to follow his career-defining role driving one of the most successful, industry changing franchises in movie history with such a badly conceived and poorly made family film. Like previous iterations, Dolittle is loosely based on British author Hugh Lofting's early 20th century children's stories about a physician who realises he can talk to animals. Aside from an intriguing opening that introduces us to Dolittle as a grief-stricken recluse living in a country mansion with a menagerie of exotic animal pals, the film fails to enchant on any level. \n Downey Jr's wandering Welsh accent is the first stumbling block, though the chief blame surely lies with writer/director Stephen Gaghan. Better known for scripting taut, Oscar-winning political thrillers such as Traffic and Syriana (which he also directed), he's got no feel for effects-heavy adventure films. Built around a dull plot involving Dolittle's globe-trotting quest to save the Queen of England (played by Jessie Buckley), this is little more than a series of chaotic set-pieces full of shoddily rendered CGI. Vocal and live-action cameos from the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Antonio Banderas, Rami Malek and Emma Thompson add little to a film in which the comic highpoint is Downey Jr pulling a set of bagpipes from a grumpy dragon's rear end.

After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, \"Sonic\" was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul - including fixing Sonic's eerily human teeth.\nThe makeover worked and audiences responded by making \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" the weekend's top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation. For Paramount, it's a welcome success following misfires such as \"Gemini Man\" and \"Terminator: Dark Fate.\" The studio estimates \"Sonic\" will gross $68 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.\n\"If you don't listen to your customer, and this goes for any business, then you're going to fail,\" said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. \"We retooled Sonic in a way that was obviously very satisfying for the fans and they were very forgiving. Now that they've seen the movie, they love the movie. It all worked out.\"\nThe Sega video game adaptation, directed by Jeff Fowler, drew decent reviews (63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an A CinemaScore from moviegoers. The $87 million production co-stars Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik with Ben Schwartz supplying Sonic's voice.\nBong Joon Ho's \"Parasite\" had its biggest weekend in its 19th week of release. Neon put \"Parasite\" into its widest release yet (2,001 theatres) following its historic win at the Oscars. (\"Parasite\" was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.) And despite the film already being available for weeks on digital platforms and on DVD, its $5.5 million weekend is the largest Oscars bump for a best-picture winner since \"Gladiator\" in 2001.\nLast week's opening of \"Birds of Prey\" followed up its limp debut by sliding to second with $17.1 million. Following its disappointing opening, some theatres retitled the movie \"Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,\" instead of \"Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn).\"\nIt was a busy weekend in theatres, with a handful of other new releases - \"The Photograph,\" \"Fantasy Island,\" \"Downhill\" - seeking to capitalize on both Valentine's Day on Friday and Presidents Day on Monday.\n\"Fantasy Island,\" the Blumhouse horror remake of the '70s TV show, fared the best, collecting $12.4 million in ticket sales despite terrible reviews. Sony Pictures handled the release of the low-budget, PG-13 film, which earned just a 9% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes.\nUniversal Pictures \"The Photograph,\" a romance starring Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield and produced by Will Packer (\"Girls Trip,\" \"Ride Along\"), opened with $12.2 million. The film, written and directed by Stella Meghie, cost $15 million to make.\n\"Downhill,\" from Disney's Fox Searchlight Pictures, debuted with $4.7 million, a modest start for a film starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell. A remake of the acclaimed Swedish film \"Force Majeure\" by Ruben \u00d6stlund, \"Downhill\" didn't do great with critics but fared even worse with audiences. They gave it a D CinemaScore.\nNeon followed up its \"Parasite\" Oscar win with the Valentine's Day release of \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire,\" one of 2019's most acclaimed films. Following a one-week qualifying run in December, Celine Sciamma's French period romance opened in 22 theatres with a strong per-theatre average of about $20,000.\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.\n1. \"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" $57 million ($44.3 million international).\n2. \"Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey,\" $17.1 million ($23 million international).\n3. \"Fantasy Island,\" $12.4 million ($7.6 million international).\n4. \"The Photograph,\" $12.3 million.\n5. \"Bad Boys for Life,\" $11.3 million ($11.1 million international).\n6. \"1917,\" $8.1 million ($6.4 million international).\n7. \"Jumanji: The Next Level,\" $5.7 million ($1.9 million international).\n8. \"Parasite,\" $5.5 million.\n9. \"Dolittle,\" $5.1 million ($8.8 million international).\n10. \"Downhill,\" $4.7 million.\n___\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP"}, {"text": "Feb 14, 2020( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  On the heels of its historic and celebrated multi-win night at the 92nd Academy Awards, the South Korean powerhouse studio behind 'Parasite' is looking to parlay its best picture win into a bigger spotlight in Hollywood. CJ Entertainment and Merchandising, headed by Miky Lee, along with RedBird Capital Partners, this week announced an investment of $275 million in Skydance Media, the film and TV production vehicle founded by David Ellison. The move not only positions Skydance for foreign expansion, even as it comes off two significant box office flops with 'Terminator: Dark Fate' and 'Gemini Man,' but also extends the reach into Hollywood for CJ Entertainment, which already has a host of english-language films in the pipeline, including a Kevin Hart remake of Korean box office hit 'Extreme Job.'[1] 'Every successful foreign film company wants to plant its flag in Hollywood,' said Sky Moore, a partner at the law firm Greenberg Glusker. 'This is the center of the universe.' \nLee, who stepped to the microphone on the Dolby stage on Oscar Sunday to uproarious encouragement, is an heiress who took her slice of the family fortune to become the most powerful media mogul in South Korea.Also Read: Skydance Lands $275 Million Investment From 'Parasite' Studio CJ ENM, RedBird Capital[2]CJ Group was founded in the early 1950s by Lee's grandfather, who was also the first chairman at Samsung. The CJ entertainment arm, which Lee oversees, financed not only 'Parasite,' but Bong Joon Ho's other films, 'Snowpiercer,' 'Mother' and 'Memories of Murder.' Lee's Korean conglomerate is not the first foreign company to show interest by dumping a chunk of change in Hollywood. Despite the company's success already, Moore isn't convinced CJ Entertainment will thrive where so many have failed before it. 'Generally, American films play better around the world, but if history be our guide, they're going to have a tough time finding success,' Moore said. 'It's hard, the road is littered with dead bodies fundamentally, the model of you give money to a studio and hope to get money back is a scary proposition.'Also Read: Bill Bost Promoted to President of TV at Skydance[3]Skydance, meanwhile, is looking to tap into overseas markets as growth at the U.S. box office slows. 'There are a lot of reasons to get into the foreign market with content, but the thing is, the U.S. box office is never growing again,' said Ross Gerber, CEO of media investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. The $275 million investment comes as Skydance clears the smoke from a pair of high-profile, big-budget box office bombs for the production house. Such a one-two punch as a succession of bombs followed by new investments in Hollywood typically raises questions about the state of a company, especially for an industry that's eaten so many independent studios alive. Skydance declined to comment for this story, as did representatives for CJ Entertainment. 'We are honored to partner with RedBird Capital and CJ ENM. These are sophisticated strategic partners who believe in our creative vision and our ambitious strategy to build the studio of the future,' Ellison said in a statement 'Their partnership will help propel us to another decade of exponential growth as we look to shape the future of where entertainment is heading.' Gerber said it's a sign that Skydance 'desperately needed the capital,' which shouldn't necessarily be a knock against Skydance. Part of the cost of doing business when you own and operate an independent studio in Hollywood is constantly needing to raise money to fuel and grow the company.Also Read: David Goyer Signs Overall Deal With Skydance Television[4]'I'm sure these investors aren't stupid. You're not there to just bail out the studio,' Moore argued. 'I work on these deals all the time. They're likely going to cabin off past losses and make sure the money is used for future growth.'Also Read: Skydance Animation's Production Head Holly Edwards Promoted to President[5]Last year, Skydance suffered two of its biggest box office let downs in 'Terminator: Dark Fate' and 'Gemini Man.' Both were done in conjunction with Paramount. Ellison's company also co-produced Netflix's '6 Underground' with Michael Bay's production company. While 'Terminator: Genisys' garnered a solid international draw, reviews and domestic box office suggest that Skydance and Paramount haven't quite been able to pull-off a Terminator reboot. The box office for 'Dark Fate,' however, was especially poor. The film grossed $261.1 million worldwide, on a production budget of $185 million \u2014 that's before prints and advertising. 'Dark Fate' ended up posting a loss of more than $70 million. 'Gemini Man' fared worse, pulling in $173.5 million on a $138 million budget. Skydance doesn't distribute the films itself, and instead partners with of Paramount, Tencent, and now CJ Entertainment in order to mitigate risk and soften the blow of box office under performers.Also Read: 'Oklahoma!' TV Adaptation Set at Skydance in Deal With Rodgers ...mmerstein[6]Skydance also doesn't own the properties it helps produce. Without knowing the nitty gritty of the deals the studio does for films with Paramount, in this town, the power resides with the distributor. 'I don't think the revenue streams of renting out the catalog is enough to offset the costs,' Gerber said. The son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison \u2014 the co-founder and current chief technology officer of software company Oracle \u2014 David Ellison founded Skydance in 2006. The studio had a tepid beginning, releasing 'Flyboys' in 2006 starring James Franco, as well as Ellison, until landing a production partnership with Paramount Pictures. With Paramount Pictures in its corner, Skydance was able to get its hands on brands such as 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Star Trek' and 'Terminator.' Not to mention, the backing of a major studio, plus Ellison's father, helped Skydance raise $350 million in equity to get the ball rolling.Also Read: Vine Alternative Investment Acquires Lakeshore Entertainment Library, International Sales[7]From then on, Skydance began focusing on event-level blockbusters for global audiences. Since 2010, Skydance has co-produced upwards of 20 films, including box office gold, such as 'Mission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout.' The big boon for Skydance, more than the gravitational pull that big Hollywood films bring, is the studio's TV division, which was launched in 2013 and continues to be a growth arm for the production company. Skydance produces some of streaming's most popular shows in Netflix's 'Grace and Frankie,' as well as 'Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan' and 'Jack Reacher' on Amazon. As more streamers come on line \u2014 Apple TV+, Peacock and HBO Max \u2014 Skydance seems to be all-in on the prospects of more TV opportunities, especially with streaming's ability to reach global audiences. In a lot of ways, however, the same problem exists as with its film projects, Skydance doesn't own its shows.Also Read: STX Entertainment Seeks Saudi Arabia Investment as Indie Studio Struggles[8]That aside, a $275 million injection of cash and a partnership with one of Asia's premier film and TV producers is a big get. Moore told it to TheWrap best: 'More money is always a good thing.' And this level of commitment from CJ Entertainment coming off of its monumental, possibly game changing win at the Oscars, might say a lot about the future of foreign films and investment in the U.S. as well as Hollywood productions around the world. Or it's possible CJ and Skydance benefit for a few years before CJ Entertainment retreats back to South Korea and David Ellison is out raising more capital to fuel the company and its growth. 'There's a lot of things in Hollywood that don't make economic sense,' Gerber said. 'Hollywood has always worked because of the glamour and glitz, and people buy into that stuff.' Only time will tell.Related stories from TheWrap: 'Parasite' Director's Korean American Interpreter Wants to Make Her Own Movie - About the Oscar Season[9]Inside the Oscars, 'Parasite' Points an Elated Hollywood Forward[10]Oscars 2020: South Korea Jubilant After Historic 'Parasite' Win[11] [ 1]: https://www.thewrap.com/kevin-hart-to-remake-extreme-job-universal/ [ 2]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/skydance-lands-275-million-investment-from-parasite-studio-cj-entertainment-redbird-capital/ [ 3]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/bill-bost-promoted-to-president-of-tv-at-skydance/ [ 4]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/david-goyer-tv-deal-skydance-television/ [ 5]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/skydance-animation-production-head-holly-edwards-promoted-to-president/ [ 6]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/oklahoma-tv-adaptation-set-at-skydance-in-deal-with-rodgers-hammerstein/ [ 7]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/village-roadshow-vine-alternative-investment-acquisition-lakeshore-entertainment/ [ 8]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/stx-entertainment-seeks-saudi-arabia-investment-as-indie-studio-struggles/ [ 9]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/bong-joon-ho-interpreter-sharon-choi-awards-season-film/ [ 10]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/inside-the-oscars-parasite-points-an-elated-hollywood-forward/ [ 11]:       \u00a0    https://www.thewrap.com/oscars-2020-south-korea-celebrates-historic-parasite-win/"}, {"text": "South Korean Parasite Bong Joon-Ho made history: it became the first non-English-spoken film to win the Oscars jackpot. In addition, she was the one with the most statuettes from last night's ceremony in Los Angeles: she also became the best director, best original screenplay and international film. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which delivers the Oscar, had never recognized a South Korean film.\nParasite thus set aside those who came as the big favorites in a group that featured 11 nominations and 1917 that had 10 nominations and all the way to sweep the awards.\nGuas\u00f3n took the obvious Best Actor award for Joaquin Phoenix and best original music (which for the first time was won by a woman, the Icelandic Hildur Gusnad\u00f3ttir).  1917 by Sam Mendes also took home the categories he had the safest: better photography (Roger Deakins, for the second year in a row), visual effects and sound mixing.\nOnce in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino's last to come up with aspirations in 10 categories, he realized two: best production design and best supporting actor for a Brad Pitt who, upon receiving him, was friendly but much more sober than in the Globes of Gold.\nMore forceful was the defeat of the other film that came with 10 nominations.  The Irishman, the last of Martin Scorsese, took nothing and that meant leaving his director, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino empty, for example. Despite this, Scorsese was given a standing ovation when Bong Joon-Ho dedicated the award to him and mentioned it as one of his main influences.\nIrish is a Netflix production. The platform came to the party with 24 nominations and left with only two: Laura Dern for Best Supporting Actress for Marriage Story and the documentary American Factory, the platform's first association with Barack and Michelle Obama's production company.\nHe also won two awards in technical areas (editing and editing sound), Against the impossible that he aspired to best film.\nAs best lead actress, she won Renee Zellweger for her judy Garland's composition. It's her second Oscar, making her one of the most awarded actresses of her generation.\nThe Academy clearly preferred for the leading the most histrionic performances, over the subtleties of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Marriage Story or Antonio Banderas in Pain and Glory.\nTaika Waititi won best adapted screenplay by Jojo Rabbit and Women's Best Costume Design, a fair but insufficient recognition for one of the best films of the year.  Toy Story 4 was the best animated film, beating FavoriteMissing Link and Spanish, Klaus.\nThe best song of the year was for Elton John and Bernie Taupin for \"[I\u2019m Gonna) Love Me Again\", Rocketman's song, John's biopic.\nParasite became the first film in 65 years to win the two great recognitions of world cinema: the Palme d'Or in Cannes and the Oscar for best film. The only time that had happened was in 1955 with Marty, a drama with Ernest Borgnine, of which few memories remain.\nBong's film tells the story of two South Korean families: the Kims are very rich and the Parks are delicious. However, by a series of circumstances they cross paths and show an impassable social rift. It is a reflection on the inequities that South Korean prosperity has left, but its hypothesis is universal. It is a great film that in Uruguay was presented at the Jos\u00e9 Ignacio International Film Festival (where it won the jackpot) and is still on the lineup in Montevideo.\nBong matched Walt Disney's record of being the person to take four awards inone night. Last year, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for Rome was made of three.\nThe ceremony lasted three and a half hours and showed, as always, the best of American cinema. He had no designated driver and appealed to the grace of some of the award anchors to keep interest. It wasn't as boring as other years.\nThe list of hosts included Salma Hayek, Oscar Isaac, Will Ferrell, Steve Martin, Chris Rock, Sigourney Weaver, Brie Larson, Gal Gadot, Steven Spielberg, Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, James Corden and Rebel Wilson draped in Cats costumes and mocking that and Diane Keaton and Keanu Reeves, the most charming couple in the world. Tom Hanks presented the opening Academy Museum and Jane Fonda presented the award for Best Picture.\nThere were a lot of musical numbers. In addition to all the nominated songs and a review of the best from some films, he acted, resirantly, Eminem. And Billie Eilish, the girl of the moment, performed, with her brother at the piano, a surrender from \"Yesterday\" that accompanied the emotional segment of the deceased film world.\nDespite what usually happens, the ceremony was not marked by politics. Although there were female claims and a confused allegation from Phoenix about animal rights and climate change, no one referred to the convulsed local politics.\nIt was, in short, a movie night. And for those who say they're predictable prizes, this year the Oscars were sent with an unexpected prize. Fair, certainly, but unexpected.>"}, {"text": "By Brennan Atkins, Editorial Staff\nBy Noah Barnes, Editorial Staff\n\"Parasite\" deserves all the recognition it got.\nWe don't always agree with the Oscar nominations and winners, over the last couple of years, we've actually been somewhat disappointed by their decisions.\nWhether it's a film that never got nominated we feel as if should've gotten recognition, such as \"Waves\" by Trey Edward Shults, or a film we feel as if shouldn't have won, such as \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" winning Best Editing, sometimes the Oscars leaves us wanting more.\nHowever, one thing that we will never do is crawl to Twitter to vehemently attack other people's opinions - If you enjoy a film, you should be allowed to do so openly without people belittling your views.\nUnfortunately, This seems to be the case all over Twitter and Youtube when it comes to Bong Joon Ho's \"Parasite,\" which got the Oscars' for Best Foreign Language film, Best Original Screenplay, and the main topic of debate - Best Picture.\nParasite is an excellent film - We are aware that if the movie didn't get as much attention with American audiences as it did, the Academy would have likely ignored it for Best Picture. But the proof is in the pudding, and it did extremely well in the American box office for a foreign film, grossing at $35 million.\nBoon Jong Ho got recognized at the Cannes International Film Festival with the Palme d'Or, a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language film, and won best international independent film at the British independent film awards. It's even getting added to the Criterion Collection, which for many directors, is a dream come true.\nSo then why is Bong Joon Ho facing so much resistance for winning Best Picture at the Oscars.\nSimilar to how they ruin anything they touch, one huge problem emerging from Twitter are blatant racists. If you don't want to read, sure, but it crosses the line of criticism when you legitimately say it's less of a film if it's in a different language.\nOne viral tweet via @Millerstream writes \"A man named Bong Joon Ho wins #Oscar for best original screenplay over Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917. Acceptance speech was: 'GREAT HONOR. THANK YOU.' Then he proceeds to give the rest of his speech in Korean.\nThese people are the destruction of America.\"\nWhile he continued to backpedal after making that tweet, it created an outlet for many other racist comments to be circulated through the web via comments. We genuinely don't understand why these people even watch the Oscars, as film is becoming more progressive every single day.\nAnother reason people are unhappy with \"Parasite\" is the fact that it won both Best Foreign Language film and Best Picture. Some believe that if it's the best foreign film, it should be immediately disqualified from being nominated for best picture. While it's true that a foreign film has never won Best Picture, this is something that happens almost every year with other categories.\nTake Peter Farrelly's \"Green Book\" for example, on top of winning Best Picture it also received the Oscars' for Best Screenplay and Best supporting actor.\nWhy should some films be restricted to certain accolades while others aren't?\nFilm, like many other art forms, can be enjoyed universally. Even without subtitles, one can appreciate certain elements in film such as cinematography, the actors' physical acting, soundtracks and editing.\nIf you genuinely didn't enjoy the writing from Boon Jong Ho, or the acting from Kang-ho Song, or any other element of the film, it's absolutely fine to be dissapointed with it winning Best Picture. We wanted \"The Lighthouse\" to be nominated for Best Picture, and were surprised to see it only got nominated for Best Cinematography.\nAdmittedly, we were a bit upset by this - But we would never verbally attack someone for disagreeing with what we believe. If you like something that we reviewed as not particularly great, that doesn't mean we think you're wrong, we simply have different tastes.\nAnyways, we couldn't be happier that \"Parasite\" won, and it's temporarily being brought back to theaters if you didn't catch the chance to watch it."}, {"text": "Photo//CJ Entertainment\n\"Parasite\" is a very complex movie, from beginning to end. It's a film that is definitely worth repeating because it'll keep you on your toes and make you think. My overall rating of the film is a 5 out of 5. I was caught off guard at first with it being a foreign film and questioning its premise, but that question didn't matter by the end of the film.\nDirected by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho, the film was first released last year in South Korea on May 30, and then in the U.S. on Oct. 5.\n\"Parasite\" is about the Kim family, who are poor and live in a small basement apartment with dreams to become rich someday. When the opportunity to get more money arises, the family devises a plan to pose as the wealthy Park family. The film touches on the idea of socio-economic classes, and how it affects the Kim family.\nThe film meets the criteria of being a good movie with an amazing director, great actors/actresses, and a terrific screenplay. Throughout the movie I was confused, laughing, and on the edge of my seat as I watched what became an innocent action turn into something more unexpected.\nBesides the actors giving great performances in the film, I think that the production crew also did a phenomenal job. Production designer Ha-jun Lee made sure that the environment and the buildings told a story. Costume designer Se-yeon Choi demonstrated that you can tell a story with subtle things, like the clothes you wear. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong made sure that the shots and angles were set up to give the characters and settings were the main spotlight.\nThe film has 6 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Director. It has also received widespread critical acclaim, earning an 8.6/10 on IMDb, 96% on Metacritic, and a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. I highly recommend seeing \"Parasite.\""}, {"text": "The 2020 Oscars last night delivered the biggest surprise\u00a0yet of this awards season, with South Korean film Parasite becoming the first non-English movie ever to win Best Picture.\n  Bong Joon-ho's darkly satirical thriller\u00a0also saw off competition from some of Hollywood's most seasoned filmmakers\u00a0to pick up Best Director, Best International Feature Film and Best Original Screenplay.\nSo what was it that won over the Academy?\nA pitch-perfect theme\nParasite \"doesn't just have something to say, but it says it artfully\", says Vox's\u00a0Alissa Wilkinson.\u00a0\nThe film follows the Kims, a poor family who scheme their way into the employment of a wealthy household and infiltrate their home.\nWilkinson argues that this \"deserving\" Best Picture winner taps\u00a0into a prevailing theme in world cinema in 2019: \"that rampant inequality all over the world was building to some kind of inevitable breaking point\".\nYet \"Parasite makes humans of everyone in its story\", she adds. \"Nobody's a caricature. Nobody's even really a villain. Instead, the system in which they live is the villain.\"\nA top acting ensemble\nAs\u00a0The Washington Post noted last week, while\u00a0Parasite was up for six Oscar nominations in total, none of its actors received individual Academy nods, reflecting a history of under-representation of Asians in Hollywood.\nHowever,\u00a0Parasite's status as an Oscars front runner was \"thanks in no small part\" to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) ensemble award that the cast bagged last month, says the newspaper.\nThe Post predicted, correctly, that \"although the actors won't be able to collect individual trophies on Sunday, their work could still prove crucial in helping make Oscars history\".\nThe Bong charm\nDirector Bong has long had a loyal following in the US, says Glenn Whipp in the Los Angeles Times.\u00a0\n\"But with Parasite, he also demonstrated a tireless energy during the long awards season, charming voters with his authentic, gracious spirit, his humor and the way he celebrated his cast's ensemble win at the SAG Awards, filming them like a proud dad,\" says the entertainment reporter.\nThe awards season momentum for Parasite \"had been building for months\" as adoration for Bong and his film \"played out at event after event\", Whipp adds.\nThe Roma backlash\nWhipp also suggests that the attention Roma received in 2019 \"paved the way for Parasite to triumph this year\".\nAlfonso Cuaron's Netflix film earned Mexico its first ever win in the Best Foreign Language Film category last year, but missed out on Best Film and Best Director, to the disappointment of many critics.\nDuring his acceptance speech, Cuaron joked that he \"grew up watching foreign-language movies... like Citizen Kane, Jaws, Rashomon, The Godfather, Breathless\".\u00a0According to The Atlantic's\u00a0Hannah Giorgis, the barb contributed to the Academy's decision to change the category's name to Best International Film in time for the 2020 awards.\nGiorgis\u00a0adds: \"Last night, Parasite built on Cuaron's challenge to the Academy.

A high-risk Korean-language fusion of farce, satire and horror, it centres on a family of four: Ki-taek (\nSong Kang-ho\n), his wife, Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin), their twentysomething son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and their daughter, Ki-jung (Park So-dam).\nThey make a sorry quartet, crammed into a tiny basement flat where they earn tiny sums from folding pizza boxes, watch drunks pee against their window and scrounge free wifi from neighbouring caf\u00e9s - Ki-jung crouches beside the toilet to get a signal and they open cans of beer to \"toast their reconnection\".\nYet their good-humoured squabbling conceals a streak of creative opportunism that surfaces when a friend of Ki-woo's offers him the chance to take over his job tutoring the daughter of a wealthy businessman. He and his family live in a vast modernist house in Seoul that couldn't be any more different from Ki-woo and co's dismal digs. It's an extraordinary space, all clean lines of glass and stone, that almost becomes a character in the film.\nKi-woo's sister forges him a university diploma and he wastes no time inveigling his way into the affections of the girl and her mother (the excellent Cho Yeo-jeong), who is as trusting as she is generous with her husband's money. \"She's rich, but she's still nice,\" Ki-taek says. \"She's nice because she's rich,\" Chung-sook says. It's one of several stinging lines in a story that was partly inspired by Bong's experience working as a tutor for a rich family.\nKi-woo's relatives are soon assuming aliases to get on the payroll of their oblivious benefactors as chauffeur, housekeeper and art teacher to their disturbed young son. The deceptions become increasingly Byzantine - the scenes in which they practise their lines are a hoot, as is Chung-sook's impression of North Korean news announcers.\nWhat's already an entertaining yarn - a heist movie crossed with a domestic farce - is then sent spinning off in a new direction by a totally unexpected twist. The film veers between comedy, social critique and much darker fare with the woozy confidence of an intoxicated person walking along a window ledge. Whatever Bong puts in his bong must be darn strong.\nSuch daring means the screenplay creaks ever so slightly in places. Yet although you expect the whole enterprise to come crashing down around Bong's ears, it never does. This is a film-maker working with delightful confidence and moral conviction.\n                   15, 132min"}, {"text": "But the lack of diversity in the nominees dominated the award ceremony, with Joaquin Phoenix calling out \u201csystemic racism\u201d in the movie business.\nLONDON \u2014 \u201c1917,\u201d Sam Mendes\u2019s visually extravagant World War I drama that takes viewers into the chaos of the trenches was the big winner at the EE British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, taking seven awards including best film.\nMendes was also named best director at the event, better known as the BAFTAs, Britain\u2019s equivalent of the Oscars.\nThe haul adds to the movie\u2019s wins for best drama and best director at the Golden Globes and will increase hype around the movie in the run-up to the Oscars.\n\u201cIn the midst of all this hoopla, it\u2019s sometimes easy to forget the actual experience of shooting a movie,\u201d Mendes said, accepting his best director award. \u201cI had a kind of director\u2019s paradise in this film that I think I\u2019ll never, ever have again.\u201d\nThe sweep for \u201c1917\u201d came despite the film receiving mixed reviews in Britain.

Joaquin Phoenix said he felt \u201cconflicted\u201d when he accepted the best actor award for \u201cJoker.\u201d\n\u201cI think that we send a very clear message to people of color that you\u2019re not welcome here,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the message we send.\u201d\nPhoenix also called out \u201csystemic racism\u201d in the film industry. \u201cIt is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression to be the ones that dismantle it,\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cThat\u2019s on us.\u201d\nPrince William, the president of BAFTA, referred to it, too, when introducing the event\u2019s final award. \u201cIn 2020 and not for the first time in the last few years, we find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to ensure diversity in the sector and in the awards process,\u201d he said. \u201cThat simply cannot be right in this day and age,\u201d he added.\nOther major winners at the BAFTAs included Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who won best actress for her portrayal of Judy Garland at the end of her life in \u201cJudy\u201d; Laura Dern, who won best supporting actress for \u201c      \u00a0    Marriage Story\u201d; and Brad Pitt, who won best supporting actor for \u201c      \u00a0    Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood\u201d \u2014 all three repeating their successes from the Golden Globes.\nPitt missed the event, but his acceptance speech \u2014 which included a reference to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union on Friday \u2014 got one of the evening\u2019s biggest laughs. \u201cHey Britain, heard you just became single,\u201d he said in a speech, read out by the actress Margot Robbie. \u201cWelcome to the club.\u201d\n\u201cThe Irishman,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s latest epic, failed to win any awards.\nThe BAFTAs are widely viewed as a bellwether for the Academy Awards, because there is some overlap between the 6,500-strong membership of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which organizes the BAFTAs, and the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\nThis year the two ceremonies are just a week apart, with the Oscars on Feb. 9.\nPHOTOS (PHOTOGRAPHS BY KRISTA SCHLUETER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES; TOBY MELVILLE/REUTERS)"}, {"text": "There has only been a handful of non-English language films to ever get a Best Picture nomination\nFOR SOME YEARS now, hallyu or the so-called Korean wave consisting of a wide variety of cultural products from melodramatic TV soaps and K-Pop to some very good films, have been lapping up on foreign shores and becoming something of an international obsession. A book-Han Kang's bestselling The Vegetarian which won the 2016 Man Booker International Prize-had made for an unusual hallyu product. We now have a film, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, that's has just booked a seat at the ultimate cultural high table, the Academy Awards.\n\nLike Alfonso Cuaron's Roma last year, this dark comic film has broken out of the Award's Best Foreign Language Film box and picked up a slew of Oscar nominations, from that for directing, original screenplay, editing, production design, international feature categories to the prized Best Picture category. It ideally should have picked up acting nods too.\n\nThere has only been a handful of non-English language films to ever get a Best Picture nomination, and, except for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, none from Asia. By the buzz Parasite began generating all of last year, it certainly has a shot. Parasite was a crowd favourite at the Cannes last year (it picked up the Palme d'Or at Cannes, the first South Korean film to do so). Since then, it's generated fawning reviews everywhere, won best foreign film at the Golden Globes a few weeks ago; and has won or been nominated for a slew of other awards.\n\nAnd it has done what international arthouse phenomena rarely do, one even Roma couldn't manage-become genuinely popular with the crowds. As AO Scott of The New York Times (NYT) wrote in his review of the film, it is 'the kind of smart, generous, aesthetically-energized movie that obliterates the tired distinctions between art films and popcorn movies.' It is already this year's theatrically most watched foreign film in the US. According to NYT, it has earned over $US25 million. In comparison, South Korea's last year's entry for best foreign picture, Lee Chang-dong's Burning, again another very good film, an adaptation of a Murakami story, which in turn was inspired by a Faulkner story, made only $719,000. Parasite is still some way away from the all-time record of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ($128m) or Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful ($57m), but who can say how it will eventually fare once the Oscar buzz picks up.\n\nIf the ultra-violent Oldboy (after picking up the silver ware at the 2004 Cannes) first opened up international audiences towards Korean cinema, Parasite might cement that industry's reputation. The film is essentially a genre-hopping upstairs-downstairs movie about class differences. It is in reality a bitter and pessimistic film but it is so encased in humour that it is difficult to realise the pill one is swallowing. You may root for the underdog, but like in real life, the underdog is not going to make it.\n\nThe film focuses on two families-the Kims, who live in a squalid house below ground level, and the Parks, who live elsewhere, in a luxurious house, but one (minor spoiler alert) which contains a secret basement. The Kims live by performing what we may call jugaad in India. They fold pizza boxes for a living, use their neighbour's Wi-Fi, and when the road above their house is fumigated, open the windows so their house's mosquitoes are exterminated. One by one, by forging documents and creating new identities, the Kims infiltrate the Parks' household by becoming their servants. The son, Ki-woo, becomes a tutor to the daughter in the Park household. He in turn gets his sister to pose as an art tutor; the two then scheme together to get their father to replace the Parks' driver; and finally, all three of them come together to plot the removal of the maid and get her replaced by the final member of the Kim family. The Parks are what we may recognise as the nice liberal elite, the types who are conscious of their privilege and speak respectfully to their help. But, the film will show, this is of course a mask, one perhaps their wearers don't even know they wear. Wealth can afford luxuries, even of becoming nice. One of the characters will say in the film, Mrs Park is 'nice because she's rich'.\n\nThe Kims are the parasites. But in some moments, even the Parks appear to be so. In one scene, the Park couple arouse themselves by talking about drugs and cheap knickers used by the poor, as though they can only sexualise their lives by invoking elements of the working class. In the middle of the act, Mrs Park strangely whispers to her husband, 'Buy me drugs.'\nThe term han-said to encompass a wide array of feelings such as anger, revenge, grief, suffering, resignation, longing and pain-became popular in the 1970s, as Koreans advocated for a kind of cultural authenticity, but its origins are older, from the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century\n\nSouth Korean movies-and the book The Vegetarian-tend to have an aesthetic that is very distinct from Western films. Their best films are more contemplative, often slower paced, and at their hearts, they carry tender stories of love between partners or within families, themes that should be more easily identifiable to Indians. But they almost always contain a strong unrecognisable undercurrent of rage. A languid story moving peacefully will inexplicably explode into an orgy of violence. People will be hacked, decapitated, disembowelled, or hammered to death. In The Vegetarian, as simple a decision as that of abstaining from meat, will upend a character and her family's lives, leading to rage and violence. For all the mirth and pleasantness of its earlier parts, Parasite also ends in violence. For a culture so steeped in values such as obedience, respect and good manners, these films are particularly shocking.\n\nThe Korean word han is often used to describe the type of rage portrayed in these films and books. A review of The Vegetarian in The New York Review of Books (NYRB) quotes the Korean author Euny Hong (in The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation Is Conquering the World Through Pop Culture) to describe the word as 'a culturally specific ultra-distilled form of rage' arising 'from the fact that the universe can never pay off this debt [of unfair treatment of Koreans], not ever.' The term (said to encompass a wide array of feelings such as anger, revenge, grief, suffering, resignation, longing and pain) became popular in the 1970s, as Koreans advocated for a kind of cultural authenticity, but its origins are older, from the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century. The NYRB article says, 'Han is a sort of unique Korean national trait or spiritual condition-a characteristic rage against other people, enemies of the nation, or even history itself.'\n\nBut where does this rage come from? An NYT article which explores this idea of rage in Korean cinema-and finds its spread even across Japan and China-suggests that it might have something to do with the Confucian philosophy and its fundamental beliefs about obedience and respect and how these have been manipulated to create a highly unequal society. In Parasite, the arrival of an ornamental rock (supposed to be venerated in Confucianism) brings luck into the Kim family. Yet, the same rock later becomes a tool of violence. 'Rage is a destructive emotion but within art, it is also radical and, in rare moments, elucidating,' the article reads. 'The best of these films understand that the outcome of pitting people against one another can be violent, that it will invariably end badly. But they also understand that a repressive society can transform individuals into monsters.'\n\nLast year, Roma came close to doing what no non-English-language film had done before. It entered the ceremony as the odds-on favourite, it made history by taking best director, but tripped up at the final hurdle of Best Picture. The cast and crew of Parasite, the millions who loved watching it and an entire generation of filmmakers across the world will be rooting for a different outcome this time."}, {"text": "After weeks of awards campaigning and hundreds of interviews, \"Parasite\" began Sunday as a successful and well-appreciated movie. Yet its Academy Awards wins for best picture and for       \u00a0    Bong Joon-ho as best director were shocks that thrilled the Asian movie industry.\n\"I'm so happy for all the Asian Film industry. It has now created bigger dreams for Asian filmmakers,\" said Jonathan Kim, Korean producer. \"Now I have a different view on Hollywood. Even Hollywood is becoming more open minded.\"\n\"Game changer!!! So happy for all of us. The Asians have finally arrived in Hollywood!\" said Andrew Ooi, president of Echelon Talent Management, a Vancouver-based management firm with a predominantly Asian clientele.\nFor many in Asia, the award was a well-deserved prize for a brilliant and imaginative director who had been known regionally, but not on a world stage, perhaps for a pesky technical problem.\n\"The Oscar win by 'Parasite' is as stunning as it is historic. It is a tremendous achievement for both Bong Joon Ho and Korean cinema as a whole. But its biggest contribution going forward may be to break apart many viewers' preconceived notions about the so-called 'limitations' of subtitled films,\" said Darcy Paquet, Korean cinema historian, former Variety correspondent, and author of the film's sub-titles.\nNo subtitled film has won the Oscar's best picture award in nearly a century.\nThat point was underlined by Thai film critic Kong Rithdee, who echoed Bong's Golden Globes acceptance speech, in which the director referred to \"the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles.\" Rithdee said that Hollywood elites \"gasped with embarrassment and sudden realization\" when they understood that Bong was pointing his finger at them.\nFor some commentators, this was a case of individual brilliance. \"There are few directors in the world who receive prizes at film festivals and cater to commercial tastes,\" film critic Jeon Chan-il told Korean news agency Yonhap. \"Bong's definitely become one of the top filmmakers in the world.\"\n\"This is surely the best possible combination - best film, best director, best original screenplay - that any movie can possible earn,\" said Winnie Lau, producer at Ivanhoe Pictures.\nFor many others, the four Oscar haul is a justification, and necessary catch-up for, the wider South Korean film industry. Korean filmmakers, including Bong, Park Chan-wook, Kim Jee-woon, Lee Chang-dong, and Hong Sang-soo, have led the way in Asia and on global the festival stage for two decades, but the country had not previously received even a single Oscars nomination.\n\"We never write to represent our countries. But this is very first Oscar to South Korea,\" said Bong on stage after receiving the award for best original screenplay. \"As there is Hollywood in the U.S., in       \u00a0    Korea we have Chungmuro (the old heartland of Korean cinema). I'd like to share this honor with all the storytellers and filmmakers at Chungmuro.\"\nCoincidentally, the Seoul Metropolitan Council, announced that it had begun construction work on a cinematheque, museum and archive complex that will open in Chungmuro in 2022.\nStill others said that the \"Parasite\" wins were a victory for diversity. \"In this year of all years, with Trump, and racism still so prevalent, this a such a vindication,\" said Maria Chan, producer.\n\" 'Parasite' made history - won best original screenplay, best international feature film, best director and best picture in 2020 Academy Awards. Congratulations!,\" said the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) in a Twitter message.\n\"Guess the #Oscars aren't so \"local\" anymore.

Paramount Pictures' 'Sonic the Hedgehog' came in well above expectations, especially for a movie that just months ago was a laughing stock. After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, 'Sonic' was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul \u2014 including fixing Sonic's eerily human teeth. \n The makeover worked and audiences responded by making 'Sonic the Hedgehog\" the weekend's top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation. For Paramount, it's a welcome success following misfires such as 'Gemini Man' and 'Terminator: Dark Fate.' The studio estimates 'Sonic' will gross $68 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.  'If you don't listen to your customer, and this goes for any business, then you're going to fail,' said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. 'We retooled Sonic in a way that was obviously very satisfying for the fans and they were very forgiving. Now that they've seen the movie, they love the movie. It all worked out.' The Sega video game adaptation, directed by Jeff Fowler, drew decent reviews (63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an A CinemaScore from moviegoers. The $87 million production co-stars Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik with Ben Schwartz supplying Sonic's voice.  Bong Joon Ho's 'Parasite' had its biggest weekend in its 19th week of release. Neon put 'Parasite' into its widest release yet (2,001 theaters) following its historic win at the Oscars. ('Parasite' was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.) And despite the film already being available for weeks on digital platforms and on DVD, its $5.5 million weekend is the largest Oscars bump for a best-picture winner since 'Gladiator' in 2001.

After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, \"Sonic\" was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul - including fixing Sonic's eerily human teeth.\nThe makeover worked and audiences responded by making \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" the weekend's top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation.

Brad Pitt for sure. Jennifer Lopez almost certainly. And very possibly the Obamas, too.\nNominations for the 92nd Academy Awards, which will begin at 8:18 a.m. EST Monday (6:48 pm Sunday, IST), should bring plenty of star power to the February 9 ceremony - a good thing, too, since the show will for the second straight year go without a host.\nThankfully, this Oscar year isn't lacking for drama. Netflix is gunning for its first best picture win, a year after Alfonso Cuaron's\"Roma fell just short. It has not just one but at least two contenders led by Martin Scorsese's elegiac crime epic The Irishman and Noah Baumbach's intimate divorce drama Marriage Story.\nBut in the lead up to Monday's nominations, much of the momentum has gone to a pair of movies that exalt the big screen with showmanship and celebrity: Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, with Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, and Sam Mendes' continuous World War I thrill ride, 1917. Hollywood, in the midst of a streaming upheaval, has so far favoured the traditionally released movies.\nStill, no definite front-runner has emerged, and nominations morning could tip the scales anew in a rapid-paced awards season that, while not lacking for the usual battery of parties, screenings and Q&As, is more condensed than usual.\nThe nominations, to be read by Issa Rae and John Cho, will be live streamed on Oscar.com, Oscars.org and the academy's digital social platforms. The second wave of nominees will begin at 8:30 a.m. EST and be carried live on Good Morning America.\nThe Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences select anywhere from five to 10 nominees for best picture, depending on how many first-placed votes a film gets. That's usually meant eight or nine movies. This year, the precursor guild nominations have suggested the sure things are Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, 1917, The Irishman, Taika Waititi's JoJo Rabbit and Bong Joon Ho's Parasite.\nThat leaves a few slots to be battled out by Joker, Little Women, Ford v Ferrari, Knives Out, Bombshell and The Farewell.\nParasite will be the first Korean film ever nominated for an Oscar but it's likely to land several nominations, including Bong for best director and possibly Song Kang Ho for best supporting actor.\nThe director category will be especially closely watched. Though Greta Gerwig (Little Women) is a possibility, the academy is expected to nominate an all-male field despite a year in which women made significant gains behind the camera. The academy has nominated only men for best director in all but five years; Gerwig was the last woman nominated, two years ago.\nIn the acting categories, Renee Zellweger (Judy) has consistently led the best actress contenders. Should Awkwafina be nominated, she would be only the second woman of Asian descent nominated in the category. (The first, 1936 nominee Merle Oberon, hid her South Asian heritage.)\nPitt has a lock on the supporting actor Oscar, which would be his first ever. Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and Lopez have led the supporting actress nominees. A nomination would be the first for Lopez.\nThe best actor category, after a few lacklustre years, has been especially competitive, with Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) and Adam Driver (Marriage Story) as the most entrenched nominees in a field including DiCaprio, Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory), Christian Bale (Ford v Ferrari), Eddie Murphy (Dolemite Is My Name), Adam Sandler (Uncut Gems) and Robert De Niro (The Irishman).\nWhile a similar result Monday is unlikely, the British Film Academy last week nominated an all-white field of acting nominees. Widely criticized, the BAFTAs pledged to review its awards process.\nBeyonce will likely add an Oscar nomination to her many honours, for her Lion King song. American Factory, the first release from Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, Higher Ground, is likely to be among the documentary nominees.\nAfter the most dominant box-office year in Hollywood history, the Walt Disney Co. will have reasons to celebrate Monday, though their top films - including the record-setting Marvel blockbuster Avengers: Endgame - are expected to be largely relegated to categories like best visual effects. The studio, which has never won a best picture Academy Award, does have a few contenders via its acquisition in April of 20th Century Fox.

Bong Joon Ho's tale[2] of con artists living off a rich family finally crossed that boundary. Other foreign language films have made it to the final round, but lost to a traditional English-language film.  Parasite wins Best Picture at the Oscars including Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, Choi Woo-shik, Kang-Ho Song,Yang Jin-mo, Jin Won Han, Kwak Sin-ae, Ha-jun Lee, Yang-kwon Moon, Kang-ho Song, Yeo-jeong Jo, Bong Joon-ho, and Sun-kyun Lee | Kevin Winter/Getty Images Parasite was already in good company with these other nominees, but if you're interested in the history behind this landmark victory[3], here are some of the other foreign language films The Academy[4] nominated in the past. \nOne year before #8216;Parastie,' #8216;Roma' had a good chance at the Best Picture Oscar Alfonso Cuaron[5]'s 2018 film Roma was an Oscar favorite. Cuaron based his black and white drama about maid (Yalitza Aparicio[6]) for a wealthy Mexican family on his own life[7] growing up. Roma still won Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director and Best Cinematography, but Green Book ultimately won Best Picture. Yalitza Aparicio in Roma | Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n/Netflix Roma's success was enough to make Steven Spielberg[8] launch a campaign to disqualify Netflix[9] from Oscar nominations. So far, Netflix is still in, as The Irishman[10] got lots of nominations too. In 2013, #8216;Amour' was the sole foreign language Best Picture nominee Michael Haneke's 2012 French film Amour was a brutal drama about an 80-something stroke victim (Emmanuelle Riva) who wanted to end her life. Her husband (Jean-Louis Trintignant) tried to care for her, facing more and more resistance. Emmanuelle Riva in Amour | Films du Losange/Sony Pictures Classics Amour won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. The Academy nominated Haneke for Best Director and Best Screenplay and Riva for her performance. Argo won Best Picture that year. #8216;Babel' and #8216;Letters From Iwo Jima' were technically foreign language films Babel was a multi-narrative story traversing multiple cultures. As such it had stories in Spanish, in Japanese, in Arabic and in sign language. It also had an American story with Brad Pitt[11] and Cate Blanchett[12] speaking English.Letters from Iwo Jima was a Clint Eastwood[13] movie. He directed the Japanese perspective on WWII as a companion to his film Flags of Our Fathers. Much of Letters isin Japanese with English subtitles, but there are also English speaking characters and it is a Hollywood production. #8216;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' was the last Asian Best Picture nominee before #8216;Parasite' Ang Lee[14]'s martial arts epic landed a Best Picture nominee. Lee would have to settle for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Cinematography for Peter Pau, Best Original Score for Tan Dun and Best Art Direction for Tim Yip. Gladiator won Best Picture that year.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a Hong Kong/Taiwanese film. The actors spoke Mandarin. Parastie is a Korean film in Korean language. #8216;Life Is Beautiful' and #8216;Il Postino' were Italian Oscar nominees Roberto Benigni achieved a remarkable feat with his 1998 film Life Is Beautiful. He made a comedy about the Holocaust. He would win Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film for it, and his composer Nicola Piovani would win Best Score. Shakespeare in Love took home Best Picture Roberto Benigni at the Oscars with Sophia Loren (R) | Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images 1995's Il Postino was a whimsical love story about a postman with a crush. He learns poetry from a poet whose mail he delivers, and those poems, and all other dialogue, are in Italian. Il Postino got the Best Picture nomination but not Best Foreign Language Film. It won for Best Score, but not Best Actor for the late Massimo Troisi or Director Michael Radford either but Braveheart won Best Picture. Earlier foreign films nominated for Best Picture Oscars For the sake of completion, here are a few more early foreign language films that landed the Best Picture nomination. 1937's French film Grand Illusion, 1968's French/Algerian Z, 1971's Swedish The Immigrants and 1972's Swedish Cries and Whispers.All in all, only 12 foreign language films ever got close to a Best Picture Oscar, and only 10 if you disqualify Babel and Letters from Iwo Jima. Hopefully Parasite is the first of many.

The film is completely subtitled, which I personally liked, and follows the Kims, a poor and unemployed family that con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks.\nThe film takes place in present-day South Korea. The Kims con and manipulate the Parks, getting each of their family members a job at the Park house, one by one, pretending not to know each other. The film is directed by Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Han Jin-won. It stars Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. This film can be classified as a tragicomedy thriller.\nThe entire cast put on a strong performance and the film has a real-life aesthetic to it that makes you relate to and understand both families' side. There isn't a clear protagonist or antagonist, because in this film, hence the title, there is a parasitic relationship between both of the families. The Kims are using the Parks for their money and the Parks are using the Kims for their labor and time.\nThere isn't anything I didn't like about this film. For a subtitled film with two-hour run time, my attention never faded. I was drawn in the entire time. The pacing was great and the twists and reveals in the movie will have you guessing what's to come next.\nA lesson that you can take from this is to always do background checks for the people you might have working with you.\nParasite won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film at the 92 Academy Awards. It was the first film to win Best International Feature since the category name was changed from Best Foreign Language Film and it was also the first international film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards ever.\nI think this is a film for audiences 18 and up. There is some violence, strong language, and sexual content in this film. I would recommend this to my mom or my friends around my age.

For the first time in the Oscars' 92 years, a foreign language film, \"Parasite,\" took home the award for Best Picture. As a Korean-American student who'd seen the film initially in Korea, I sat waiting by the screen, shocked and elated. Though the film was almost universally acclaimed by both moviegoers and critics alike, the win still came as a surprise. Many had lost hope for the Oscars; after the lingering problem of #OscarsSoWhite in 2015 and the disappointment of \"Green Book\" winning in 2019, it seemed like the acclaimed awards ceremony was becoming increasingly distant from the movement of masterful filmmaking and rewarding movies that many felt were patronizing to audiences of color. \"Parasite\" proved both to viewers and future artists, including students at Princeton and across the world, that new voices could change this past.\nLooking at past Oscars history, it was unlikely that \"Parasite,\" an incredible South Korean film, would have a chance at Best Picture. However, when the night ended and Bong Joon Ho was called to the stage for the fourth time (he also won Best Original Screenplay, Best International Film, and Best Director), it felt like something had changed. Finally, it seemed, the Oscars had rightfully acknowledged the talent and storytelling that surpassed identity, nation, and language. Across the internet, fans and critics alike celebrated the turning of a new leaf.\nThe movie's win was groundbreaking, a crucial moment in which international creative voices were finally brought into the picture. The United States, while often concerned with its own lack of representation, has almost always felt a need to separate from other countries and their art, regarding them as \"special\" yet somehow inferior. International film festivals such as Cannes rarely receive domestic attention, and foreign language films are usually presented with awards way before the stars of the night - domestic actors and films.\n\"Parasite\" opened the eyes of American awards to the global arena of film, subtly threatening that if the Oscars didn't catch on, the rest of the world would move on. For many, it confirmed that the awards were still in touch with incredible filmmaking, choosing innovation, brilliance, and relevance over big names (Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino) and pop culture icons (\"Joker\"). More than anything, the win asserted that a ceremony that appears as lofty as the Oscars still acknowledged the immediacy and pertinence of the film's message: a direct confrontation of economic inequality and the consequences of capitalism.\nHowever, it's difficult to claim that \"Parasite\" saved the Oscars. Though it represented an important step forward, the film didn't free the awards ceremony from its previous criticisms. Despite an attempt to invite diverse performers - such as Janelle Monae or Chris Rock - glaring holes in the nominations were still present. Cynthia Erivo was the only person of color to receive an acting nomination. Once again, there were no women directors nominated, despite 2019 being a huge year for women in film, from Greta Gerwig's \"Little Women\" to Lulu Wang's \"The Farewell.\"\nEven the success of \"Parasite\" continues to illuminate resting prejudices in the Oscars and in the awards community in general. The history of Asian and Asian-American actors being ignored and devalued persists. The fact that none of the cast members received any acting nominations perpetuates the idea that, despite a great story, the idea of good acting as we understand it must be American. \"Parasite\" was the first film to win Best Picture without acting nominations since \"Slumdog Millionaire\" in 2009, another film with two main characters of color. Though Bong Joon Ho's name has been mentioned and celebrated throughout the awards season, many of the main actors' names are barely mentioned in articles and reviews. While \"Parasite\" may have been a masterpiece of filmmaking, this erasure labels international actors and filmmakers as still foreign, only to be understood as a collective identity.\nDespite these continuing disparities, we should take this moment to commemorate such a historic win. When I first saw \"Parasite\" this past summer in Seoul, I was immediately struck by its intelligence and sensitivity, its revelations and twists. But even when it began to hit American theaters, I never expected much. I was familiar with the history of Asian and Asian-American stories, accustomed to the tradition of ignorance. Yet \"Parasite\" showed us all a new possible world of film, one where all stories and voices are recognized for talent, not identity - for universality, not familiarity. The Oscars are not perfect, but this weekend, \"Parasite\" opened new doors for all of us towards conversation and hope. For now, let's celebrate.\nKate Lee is a first-year from Austin, Texas.

Bong Joon-ho, 49, best known for daring arthouse hits including \"Okja\" and \"Snowpiercer\", won for a satire which critics said powerfully tapped into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.\nAccepting the prize from French movie legend Catherine Deneuve, Bong said winning at Cannes had been a lifelong dream.\"I was a little boy who was crazy about cinema since I was 12 years old,\" Bong said, hoisting the palm-frond statuette in the air.\n\"Parasite\" is the second Asian film in a row to triumph at the world's biggest film festival. It tapped into similar themes explored by last year's winner, \"Shoplifters\" by Hirokazu Kore-eda about a family of small-time crooks, which shone a light on Japan's hidden poor.\nDespite some of his strongest reviews in years, Quentin Tarantino failed to win anything for \"Once Upon a Time..\n. in Hollywood\", which brought together two of Tinseltown's most dashing leading men, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, for the first time.\nThe first black woman to compete for Cannes' top prize, Mati Diop, was runner-up for \"Atlantics\", a chilling ghost story about Senegalese migrants dying at sea.Antonio Banderas got the best actor award for Pedro Almodovar's \"Pain and Glory\", a loosely autobiographical picture based on the director's colourful life.\nAn emotional Banderas said it was the first major prize of his 40-year career. \"I respect him, I admire him, I love him, he's my mentor and he's given me so much,\" he said of Almodovar, who cast the actor in eight films and helped make him a global box office draw.\n\"This award has to be dedicated to him,\" he added.- 'Dark and difficult times' -Belgium's Dardenne brothers, two-time winners of the Palme d'Or, clinched the best director gong for \"Young Ahmed\" about a teenage boy who falls under the influence of an Islamist hate preacher.\nJean-Pierre Dardenne said the movie offered an ultimately optimistic vision \"in these dark and difficult times with identitarian populism on the rise\".Britain's Emily Beecham won best actress for \"Little Joe\", a feminist sci-fi thriller by Austrian director Jessica Hausner about the mysterious powers of a bio-engineered plant.\nThe third-place jury prize was shared by the gritty French police drama \"Les Miserables\" and Brazil's \"Nighthawk\", a darkly satirical Western seen as a searing indictment of life under the country's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.Best screenplay went to France's Celine Sciamma, one of four women in competition, for \"Portrait of a Woman on Fire\", a lushly subversive lesbian love story set in the 18th century.\n - 'Worries, nightmares' -Many critics loved Tarantino's rollicking odyssey through the Los Angeles of 1969 in the period leading up to the Manson family murders, particularly Pitt's performance as a hoary stuntman.However the director -- who won the Palme d'Or 25 years ago for \"Pulp Fiction\" -- collected the Palm Dog prize Friday for Cannes' best canine performance, joking, \"At least I do not go home empty-handed\".\n The Camera d'Or for best first feature film went to Guatemala's Cesar Diaz for \"Our Mothers\", a drama about those \"disappeared\" during the country's brutal civil war.The jury gave a special mention to Palestinian film-maker Elia Suleiman's \"It Must Be Heaven\" about the experiences of an exile who goes on a meandering odyssey from his hometown of Nazareth to the streets of Paris and New York.\nThis year's jury president, Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu of \"Birdman\" and \"The Revenant\" fame, said they selected films among the 21 contenders that tapped into the zeitgeist of a fraught era.\"These artists are visionaries who are.\n..\n expressing those worries and frustrations, those nightmares,\" he said.\"Cinema now has the urgency of social consciousness expressed by people around the world.\n\"- 'Devastating electric shock' -\"Parasite\" tells the story of a young man living in a squalid apartment with his family who is struggling in Seoul's gig economy.Without formal qualifications, he charms his way into a job with a wealthy family, tutoring their precocious daughter in English.\nSoon the tutor's parents and sister also manage to insinuate themselves into the household of the blithely privileged clan living in a luxury home high above the flood plain.Variety critic Jessica Kiang called the film \"roaringly furious\".\n\"'Parasite' is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage,\" she said.US movie website Indiewire called it a \"brilliant and devastating electric shock of economic anxiety\" and a \"compassionate parable about how society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people.\n\""}, {"text": "As Neon basked in the afterglow of four Oscar wins including Best Picture for \"      \u00a0    Parasite,\" the movie doubled its gross on its 19th weekend, by far its best showing. Universal's Oscar-winner \"1917\" also stayed strong in even more theaters, grossing higher still.\nNeon also ruled the roost with another potential crossover film, Valentine's Day weekend entry \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire.\" C\u00e9line Sciamma's period bodice-ripper, which returned to theaters after a one-week Oscar qualifying multi-city run, showed significant success in most locations, not only core specialized, but also more mainstream theaters.\nOtherwise, weekend results continue mixed. Searchlight released marriage story \"Downhill\" wide to less than enthusiastic response, while Bleecker Street went limited with a modest reaction to their serious romantic drama \"Ordinary Love.\" This was a weekend to spotlight films about couples, but Valentine's Day didn't deliver any significant boost.\nThe other standout opener was \"The Times of Bill Cunningham\" (Greenwich), which opened strong in two New York theaters despite the photographer having already been portrayed in another documentary.\nAmong the non-reporting films is \"Corpus Christi\" (Film Movement), the International Feature Film nominee from Poland, which had an advance run in Chicago this weekend and debuts in New York on Wednesday.\nAll grosses below are estimates for the three day weekend. The Presidents Day semi-holiday should add 10% or more to all of these figures.\nOpening\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire\u00a0(Neon) - Metacritic: 95; Festivals include: Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, New York 2019\n(reopening after December qualifying run)\n$440,907 in 22 theaters; PTA: $20,041; Cumulative: $559,510\nNeon follows up its huge subtitled success with \"Parasite\" with the biggest launch for a French film in many years. Sciamma's romance between two women, which some believed should have been the French Oscar entry, opened in two theaters for a week in December to top-level reviews (December numbers are in the cumulative total). Neon now brings it to six cities for its official opening.\nThe $20,000 PTA (which includes Thursday as well as some additional earlier shows) are outstanding. The four core New York/Los Angeles theaters - again not the first weekend for two of them - will have a PTA of over $40,000 for the three days. That's heading for phenomenal territory for a subtitled film.\nRemember: before \"Parasite\" it had been several years since a specialized subtitled film grossed even $5 million domestic. It's early, but expect this to manage that and more.\nWhat comes next: This opens in further markets this Friday with a steady expansion ahead.\nDownhill\u00a0(Searchlight) - Metacritic: 49; Festivals include: Sundance 2020\n$4,671,000 in 2,301 theaters; PTA: $2,030\nThough this remake initially opened wide, this specialty film from core supplier Searchlight premiered at Sundance. It's a remake of Swedish \"Force Majeure,\" a recent subtitled arthouse success, and its directors previously made \"Way Way Back.\" Given the film's two stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell, it made sense to open with a 2,301 theater Valentine's Day break. On paper the marital comedy showed commercial appeal, so going for the greater glory was logical (especially if strong reviews were not in the offing).\n\"Downhill\" also landed a D Cinemascore, confirming that the public was not responsive. It will make the Top Ten, and grossed slightly ahead of pessimistic predictions. Its 26% drop after Friday (which was boosted by previews and Valentine's Day) is not a disaster, but it's hard to see this one sticking around much beyond next week.\nWhat comes next: It might creep to as much as $5 million, which is less than such weak festival-launched movies with adult appeal as \"Blinded by the Light\" and \"Late Night.\"\nThe Times of Bill Cunningham\u00a0(Greenwich) - Metacritic: 68; Festivals include: New York 2018\n$44,475 in 2 theaters; PTA: $22,238\nThis is an extraordinary performance, given that legendary New York Times street life photographer Bill Cunningham was already the subject of a 2011 documentary (\"Bill Cunningham: New York\"), which grossed over $1.5 million. Following his death, a second non-fiction portrait opened in two New York theaters for the best results for a documentary since last fall, as well as one of the top initial PTAs so far this year.

Universal's Oscar-winner '1917' also stayed strong in even more theaters, grossing higher still. Neon also ruled the roost with another potential crossover film, Valentine's Day weekend entry 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire[3].' Cline Sciamma's period bodice-ripper, which returned to theaters after a one-week Oscar qualifying multi-city run, showed significant success in most locations, not only core specialized, but also more mainstream theaters. Otherwise, weekend results continue mixed. \nSearchlight released marriage story 'Downhill[4]' wide to less than enthusiastic response, while Bleecker Street went limited with a modest reaction to their serious romantic drama 'Ordinary Love.' This was a weekend to spotlight films about couples, but Valentine's Day didn't deliver any significant boost. The other standout opener was 'The Times of Bill Cunningham' (Greenwich), which opened strong in two New York theaters despite the photographer having already been portrayed in another documentary. Among the non-reporting films is 'Corpus Christi' (Film Movement), the International Feature Film nominee from Poland, which had an advance run in Chicago this weekend and debuts in New York on Wednesday. All grosses below are estimates for the three day weekend. The Presidents Day semi-holiday should add 10% or more to all of these figures.OpeningPortrait of a Lady on Fire(Neon) - Metacritic: 95; Festivals include: Cannes, Telluride, Toronto, New York 2019 (reopening after December qualifying run) $440,907 in 22 theaters; PTA: $20,041; Cumulative: $559,510 Neon follows up its huge subtitled success with 'Parasite' with the biggest launch for a French film in many years. Sciamma's romance between two women, which some believed should have been the French Oscar entry, opened in two theaters for a week in December to top-level reviews (December numbers are in the cumulative total). Neon now brings it to six cities for its official opening. The $20,000 PTA (which includes Thursday as well as some additional earlier shows) are outstanding. The four core New York/Los Angeles theaters \u2014 again not the first weekend for two of them \u2014 will have a PTA of over $40,000 for the three days. That's heading for phenomenal territory for a subtitled film. Remember: before 'Parasite' it had been several years since a specialized subtitled film grossed even $5 million domestic. It's early, but expect this to manage that and more. What comes next: This opens in further markets this Friday with a steady expansion ahead. Downhill(Searchlight) - Metacritic: 49; Festivals include: Sundance 2020 $4,671,000 in 2,301 theaters; PTA: $2,030 Though this remake initially opened wide, this specialty film from core supplier Searchlight premiered at Sundance. It's a remake of Swedish 'Force Majeure,' a recent subtitled arthouse success, and its directors previously made 'Way Way Back.' Given the film's two stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell, it made sense to open with a 2,301 theater Valentine's Day break. On paper the marital comedy showed commercial appeal, so going for the greater glory was logical (especially if strong reviews were not in the offing). 'Downhill' also landed a D Cinemascore, confirming that the public was not responsive. It will make the Top Ten, and grossed slightly ahead of pessimistic predictions. Its 26% drop after Friday (which was boosted by previews and Valentine's Day) is not a disaster, but it's hard to see this one sticking around much beyond next week. What comes next: It might creep to as much as $5 million, which is less than such weak festival-launched movies with adult appeal as 'Blinded by the Light' and 'Late Night.' The Times of Bill Cunningham(Greenwich) - Metacritic: 68; Festivals include: New York 2018 $44,475 in 2 theaters; PTA: $22,238 This is an extraordinary performance, given that legendary New York Times street life photographer Bill Cunningham was already the subject of a 2011 documentary ('Bill Cunningham: New York'), which grossed over $1.5 million. Following his death, a second non-fiction portrait opened in two New York theaters for the best results for a documentary since last fall, as well as one of the top initial PTAs so far this year. The earlier film also had a strong start (adjusted over $35,000 in a single theater), but this result is equally impressive. What comes next: Los Angeles opens this Friday, with top 50 markets included through March. Ordinary Love(Bleecker Street) - Metacritic: 72; Festivals include: Toronto 2019 $24,874 in 3 theaters; PTA: $8,291 This yielded decent reviews, especially for Liam Neeson and Lesley Manville as a couple coping with the wife's breast cancer. But top theater placement led to only a modest initial result. Saturday showed a decent 26% uptick so this might find decent word of mouth ahead. What comes next: With seven new cities, this will be at 12 theaters to start its expansion this Friday.

The South Korean film, by the now Academy Award winning director Bong Joon-Ho, has been the proverbial talk of the town among movie critics and filmmakers around Hollywood and the internet. Having seen \"Parasite\" today, I can say, without any doubt in my mind, that it certainly deserves all the praise it gets. However, this column is not a review for \"Parasite\" itself, but rather an important theme that is central to \"Parasite,\" and several other films this year: the theme of class division.\n\"Parasite,\" \"Ready or Not,\" \"Hustlers,\" \"Knives Out\" and \"Joker\" have all been outspoken in their ideas about the divide between the working class and the bourgeoisie. \"Hustlers\" was about a group of exotic dancers scamming Wall Street suits for their part in the 2008 subprime mortgage scandal. \"Ready or Not\" follows a young bride-to-be from a working class background as she is hunted like an animal by her fiance's rich family. \"Knives Out\" deals with a group of people from both sides of the class divide fighting over a dead author's estate. \"Joker\" deals with a working class man beaten down by a late-capitalist society until he cannot take it anymore and fights back.\nIt's not unusual for Hollywood and non-Hollywood screenwriters to craft narratives about class divides. Several big examples include such works like \"Taxi Driver,\" \"Spartacus\" and even \"Titanic.\" What is unusual is for many of these movies to be released within the same year. It is unusual for Hollywood screenwriters to be so vocal about the widening class divides in our society and for all of these films to feel so raw and relevant to how moviegoers feel today.\nYears back, many Hollywood screenwriters, and by extension studios, were afraid of making movies that were too outspoken about the divide between the rich and the poor for fear of being blacklisted. Even after the Hollywood blacklist ended, in the neoliberalism era, it seemed as if studios weren't interested in making such movies with an emphasis on lass divides, possibly out of fear of being \"too controversial\" and hurting box-office winnings.\nHowever, since we now have been living in an era of late capitalism, arguably since 2008, Hollywood screenwriters have become more and more bold. Does this mean that all Hollywood screenwriters have been reading Marxist theory for the last few years? Probably not, but it may be because of something that has been central to all forms of art since the time of the ancient Greeks and beyond. That is, all great works of art can be seen as a parable of the times they were made in.\nHollywood movies often act as an opiate for the woes of our daily lives, but some movies prefer to stay as close to real life and current events as possible. These movies act as a parable to our lives and the problems we face, even if the names and locations may be changed. Such movies can be uncomfortable because they remind us of what's wrong with the world, but in a way, it's important that they do. We could stick our proverbial heads in the sand with escapist fantasies, or force ourselves to look at the harsh truth about our world.\nEach of the films this year have been forthright in their ideas about what's wrong in the world in ways that we can't help but agree with, sometimes in subtle ways or as loud as a bomb. \"Parasite\" acknowledged that while the upper class may be cheerful and friendly, they inadvertently see the lower classes as little more than robots. \"Joker\" makes a strong case for treating social services as important for the working class and respecting people suffering from mental illness. \"Hustlers\" acknowledged that there was no serious punishment for people responsible for the 2008 subprime mortgage scandal. Finally, \"Ready or Not,\" although an exaggeration, correctly pointed out how the bourgeoisie often profit of the suffering of the lower classes.\nThese movies about class struggle have got all of us talking and thinking about one of the biggest issues of our time. All I can say to these screenwriters is to keep up the good work! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nKelly Baker is a WCU alumnus.

What was even more impressive was that it was the first non-English film to make this sort of impact on the West. While the reaction to 'Parasite' has been mostly positive as the film continues to garner more accolades, there is a section that is crying foul over the movie. \nNow, the producer of Minsara Kanna, PL Thenappan is planning to sue the makers of the Oscar-winning film and has been vocal about taking legal action. 'Parasite' versus 'Minsara Kanna' two films, same plot? The dark comedy thriller 'Parasite' directed by Bong Joon-Ho, starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam is centred on a family scheming to become part of a wealthy household through deceit and entering as highly qualified individuals. The film received positive reviews for the filmmaking, acting and smart plot. The film though has come under the scanner for being similar in plot to Minsara Kanna, the 1999 Tamil [1]film starring Vijay[2]. Minsara Kanna, on the other hand, focusses on the love story between Kannan played by Vijay and Indira played by Monica Castellino. In this film, Vijay enters Indira's house pretending to be somebody else in order to convince her to be with him. While the basic plot of the two films looking at the class conflict appears to be similar, it would be hard to discern whether the two films are exactly the same. Further, PL Thenappan has been considering seriously taking the accusation forward. He also informed the media that he will hire an international lawyer and take the legal route in this regard. Previously KS Ravikumar also spoke about how he was happy he had chosen to make an Oscar-worthy film twenty years ago. The public verdict regarding Parasite and Minsara Kanna The debate continues and makers of the two films decide whether or not to sort it out. In the meantime, fans and audiences on Twitter[3]are expressing their views on the issue. There are many who believe the similarities are clear and evident:Thanks Oscars for appreciating Korean Minsara Kanna \u2014 Balaji Gopal (@gopalbalaji) February 10, 2020[4] I can't believe Minsara Kanna won the Best picture academy award ? \u2014 Jawa Kumar (@jawa_kumar) February 10, 2020[5] However, there are those who think not: if you say that the parasite has similar story with Minsara Kanna then accept the fact that the their was copied from Jason film (Homefront) \u2014 Muralidharan (@Muralikris98) February 11, 2020[6] minsara kanna is literally a rom com and you're comparing that to parasite i have no words. \u2014 ?\u2077 (@pearltaes) February 15, 2020[7] ppl r really saying parasite is a rip off of minsara kanna... the ppl saying that probably havent watched parasite and just wanna start a fight.. \u2014 #\u20ddrin\u2077 (@enbyvmon) February 15, 2020[8] Will 'Parasite' now have to make amends or will the issue blow over?

The festival loaded some of the most buzzed-about Oscar contenders toward the end, including Parasite, which played to a packed Lucas Theatre for the Arts on Friday night. \nHollywood Reporter's Scott Feinberg even tweeted[1] that it was the 'hottest ticket' of the festival. But that wasn't the only hot ticket. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood also performed to a packed house on the final night and had people moved to tears over it, including Rotten Tomatoes Awards Editor Jacqueline Coley, who during a Q...ollowing the film admitted that she'd seen it twice and cried each time. Here's a look at the films showcased during the final nights of the SCAD Savannah Film Festival.Just MercyBased on the incredible true story, Just Mercy (directed by Destin Daniel Cretton) recalls how civil rights defense attorney Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) took on the case of inmate Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), who was put on death row a year before his case even went to trial (yes, really). Naturally, with heavy-hitters like Jordan and Foxx, one would think this would be these two going head to head in every scene, but there are two supporting players who are scene-stealers. First is Rob Morgan, whose character Herbert Richardson is a Vietnam vet suffering from post-traumatic stress. On death row like McMillian, Richardson admits to his crime (he planted a bomb on a woman's doorstep), but he was never given adequate law support when his case went to trial and admittedly should have been placed in an institution. Morgan stutters and stammers and clearly appears to be a man shook by events in his past. His story culminates in one of the most unforgettable scenes of the year. The second memorable supporting player is Tim Blake Nelson as Ralph Myers, an inmate whose story provides the whole basis for McMillian's original trial. Nelson (who also appears in The Report) puckers his face and twists his body, and while for some part of the movie he serves as a villain, he proves to be a victim of the justice system like inmates Richardson and McMillian, a system rigged against the poor and people of color (or both). Also in the cast is Brie Larson as Stevenson's assistant Eva Ansley, a part that's terribly underwritten, with Larson mostly reserved for flabbergasted swears in a Southern accent. Martin Scorsese recently came under fire on Twitter for not having enough female characters in his movies, but when it's done like this, I think it's OK to leave them out. Overall, Just Mercy continues this year's festival theme of wrongfully imprisoned (see Clemency, The Report), and I'm glad I saw it after the other films because it provides hope and leaves you on a high note.WavesWriter/director Trey Edward Schults follows up 2017's It Comes At Night,a post-apocalyptic family drama starring Joel Edgerton and Christopher Abbott, with a modern-day family drama set in South Florida starring Sterling K. Brown, Kelvin Harrison Jr., and Taylor Russell. Putting them side by side, I would have never guessed it came from the same director, even if the themes are similar in the complexities of relationships. Waves sneaks up on you, and the trailer for it definitely doesn't do it justice. In fact, the trailer wisely leaves you in the dark on what the film is truly about. It took me on an emotional roller coaster ride. Without getting spoiler-y, Waves works in two parts and pivots to a different point of view halfway through the movie. Kelvin Harrison Jr.'s Tyler plays a high school student under a lot of pressure, to be a top athlete in wrestling and to be better in the eyes of his father. And yet, another key component of this story is virtually missing from the first half of the film, and only later do we get to see that side of the story. While the film will definitely conjure up comparisons to Moonlight, in its South Florida setting and focus on a black family, the comparisons stop there, because Waves stands on its own as a thoughtful study into a devastating family dynamic.ParasiteI get nervous when a movie has hype, because that buildup sometimes becomes so exponential that my expectations can never reach it. But Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite lives up to the hype across the board. The premise of the film almost starts out like a sitcom. A poor family (the Kims), living in filth in a basement apartment, infiltrates a wealthy family (the Parks) by landing jobs as members of their staff, including English tutor, art therapist, driver, and housekeeper\u2014all under the guise that they are not related to each other and based simply on recommendation. In addition to observations about the haves and have-nots, Parasite makes sharp commentary on 'review' culture, with Mrs. Park (Yeo-jeong Jo) blindly appointing strangers to be alone with her children and in her house simply based on domino-like recommendations from each staff member, without using her own experience and intelligence to trust in her own sound judgment. Then something truly strange happens that completely twists this story. And even though Parasite takes place outside of the United States, the themes are universal for any audience. While watching, I wondered what director might want to do an 'American' remake with 'white trash' hicks infiltrating an affluent family, but then I realized The Simpsons kind of already did this in the episode 'Bart Carny,' so maybe that will deter an American remake, because this film should stand alone in the sewage water it rose up from.A Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodI'll admit it. As a Pittsburgher, I was a little skeptical when I first saw Tom Hanks in that promo photo as Mister Rogers, because no one can be Mister Rogers. Period. No one looks like him, sounds like him, or acts like him. But director Marielle Heller wisely told the two-time Academy Award winner not to do an impression, and instead, he captures Fred Rogers's essence and tone in a way I never thought he could (although, c'mon, it's Tom Hanks! How could I have doubted him?). Hanks truly astounds in this performance. We're so used to seeing him in parts where he dominates every scene (think Castaway, his last Oscar-nominated role, the fact of which is completely absurd). Here, he takes a backseat (well, maybe a passenger seat) to Matthew Rhys's Lloyd Vogel, even if Fred Rogers's presence is still felt throughout. Rhys is also excellent and should not get lost in the Oscar conversation, even if this year's Best Actor race is congested. Not only is this a love letter to Mister Rogers, but Marielle Heller's direction also pays homage to the iconic direction of the show. The film even acts as an episode of the series, with Rogers (or 'Roge' as Joanne Rogers calls him) teaching a lesson about, and to, Lloyd Vogel. This inventive approach can also be credited to writers Noah Harpster (who also has a part in the film) and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, who take what could be a saccharine script and ground it with humanity (even Fred Rogers himself makes mistakes). I'm glad I went to see it with a crowd of non-Pittsburghers, because as a resident, I didn't have to deal with people cheering every time someone said 'Pittsburgh,' even though I internally laughed when Hanks said, 'La-trobe' instead of 'Lay-trobe.' It was a great film to end the festival on, with the idea that the world could still use a little more Mister Rogers in it. What a great fest! See you next year.

At that B.O. level, for a film that's from a foreign country and entirely in a different language,\u00a0Parasite is very, very close to busting\u00a0into the top 10 foreign language films of all-time list, which is headed by 2000's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\u00a0at $128M.\nThis is a remarkable feat for Parasite, demonstrating that foreign films can still cross over stateside in a massive way. Also at a time when some believe that streaming has swallowed up specialty films in their entirety with pics like\u00a0Roma\u00a0and\u00a0Marriage Story,\u00a0sorry, but No: Theatrical is still king.\nParasite\u00a0became the highest grossing Palme D'Or winner in France and North America in 15 years since the release of Michael Moore's\u00a0Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004 ($119.1M domestic, $222.4M worldwide).\nIn the wake of winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and opening on Nov. 8 stateside,\u00a0Parasite\u00a0continues to hold the best opening screen average of the year with $131K (at three theaters) in the wake of such 4Q competition from Jojo Rabbit,\u00a0and this weekend's\u00a0Uncut Gems\u00a0and\u00a0Bombshell.\u00a0\nTo date the pic has amassed 3 Golden Globe noms for best film drama, best director and best foreign film, a SAG cast ensemble nom, 7 Critics Choice noms including Best Picture, an Independent Spirit Nom for foreign film; best film, director and supporting actor (Kang-ho Song) from the LA Film Critics, Best foreign film from the National Board of Review and NY Film Critics among many other honors.\nNote, in our top foreign language domestic list we're not counting U.S. born wide releases like Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ\u00a0which was fueled by faith-based crowds and was in Aramaic (making $370.7M stateside), nor are we counting the flimmaker's Disney major studio release of Apocalypto\u00a0which was in Mayan ($50.8M). Rather, movies from foreign countries that were released on the specialty circuit and crossed over to the masses. This list would include Mexico's Eugenio Derbez's Instructions Not Included\u00a0(even though it's in Spanish and English) which was released by Lionsgate's Pantelion Films and made $44.4M, now ranked in 4th place behind Sony Pictures Classics' 4x Oscar winner Crouching Tiger, Miramax's three-time Oscar winner Life Is Beautiful ($57.2M), and Miramax's Hero ($53.7M).\nParasite,\u00a0now ranked 11th, will very soon takeover MGM's 1979 release of La Cage Aux Folles ($20.4M) for 10th place and could very well with its continued awards season theatrical relaunch next year potentially become the 7th or 8th highest grossing foreign language film besting Jet Li's Fearless\u00a0from 2006 which made $24.6M or Miramax's 1995\u00a0Il Postino\u00a0($21.8M).

The complete exclusion of Lulu Wang's much-admired female-centric Chinese-American drama does little to boost the Academy's inclusivity credentials.\n\"In the past, the pushback against #OscarsSoWhite was, 'There just weren't enough performances to nominate,'\" said April Reign, the activist who created the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag in 2015.\n\"Well, that's not the case this year. There was a wealth of talent - and not just of black performers but of various marginalised communities - that was overlooked. And it's really unfortunate.\"\nJoker is also the nominee to beat at the Oscars this year, where it likewise goes into the race with 11 nominations, including best picture, best director and best actor for       \u00a0    Joaquin Phoenix.\nIt is only the second comic-book movie to land a best picture nomination, following Black Panther in 2018. Nine years before, Christopher Nolan's Gotham-set The Dark Knight was snubbed for best picture - a move that many felt damagingly highlighted the divergent tastes of Oscar voters and paying audiences.\nSome saw Joker's position on the top of the pile as further evidence of an endemic misogyny in the film industry, however. Said Melissa Silverstein, the founder of Women and Hollywood: \"You don't have to look further that the movies nominated for the most Oscars this year to realize how white boy centric Hollywood is. A war movie, a mob movie and movie about an incel. Why we continue to glorify these stories over and over again is the crux of the problem.\"\nComing in with 10 nominations are Sam Mendes's first world war thriller 1917, Quentin Tarantino's love letter to 60s LA,       \u00a0    Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and Martin Scorsese's wintry mob epic,       \u00a0    The Irishman.\nNetflix, the studio responsible for that film, came away with 24 nominations from Monday's announcement: leading the pack for the first time, but still fewer than anticipated, because of the complete lack of nods for Dolemite Is My Name and slightly underwhelming totals for Marriage Story and       \u00a0    The Two Popes.\nDisney picked up 23 nominations, while Sony - whose slate last year included Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - took 20.\nMarriage Story, Noah Baumbach's divorce drama, ended up with six nominations, including for stars Adam Driver and       \u00a0    Scarlett Johansson. Johansson's role in       \u00a0    Jojo Rabbit means she will also be in the running in the best supporting actress race this year - although       \u00a0    Laura Dern 's turn as her cynical lawyer in Marriage Story makes her the favourite.\nLittle Women's Florence Pugh, Richard Jewell's Kathy Bates and       \u00a0    Margot Robbie (for       \u00a0    Bombshell, costing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood a key nod) round out the category - leaving Jennifer Lopez unrecognised for her pole-dancing turn in Hustlers.\nMeanwhile, The Irishman's Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, plus       \u00a0    Tom Hanks,       \u00a0    Anthony Hopkins and       \u00a0    Brad Pitt, whose part in Tarantino's film has earned him some career-best notices, compete for supporting actor.\nPhoenix is the man to beat for leading actor, having taken the lion's share of awards so far for his transformative performance in Joker. He is up against Driver, Leonardo DiCaprio,       \u00a0    Jonathan Pryce (for The Two Popes) and Pain and Glory's       \u00a0    Antonio Banderas.\nEddie Murphy and Adam Sandler failed to capitalise on prodigious buzz for Dolemite Is My Name and Uncut Gems, respectively - and Robert De Niro's leading role in The Irishman again failed to win over first-round voters. Taron Egerton's Golden Globe win on Sunday for his Elton John in Rocketman did not in the end convert to an Oscar nomination.\nAnother apparent lock-in leads the best actress nominations: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, whose turn as Judy Garland in last year's biopic has won over critics and voters in other awards bodies alike. Competing against her, Johansson and Erivo are Little Women's       \u00a0    Saoirse Ronan and Bombshell's       \u00a0    Charlize Theron.\nLast year's Oscars won much praise for handing out four trophies - including best director - to Alfonso Cuaron's Spanish-language, black-and-white story of a domestic servant, Roma; praise tempered by the eventual victory of reductive interracial road movie Green Book for best picture.\nThis year, second-round voters have the chance to repeat the trick by honouring a foreign-language film in categories other than best international film: Parasite - which tells of an impoverished family infiltrating the lives of a wealthy household - is also up for best film, best director, best original screenplay, best editing and best production design.\nThe Baftas announcement last week led to such a backlash that the awards body promised a major review of its voting procedures. Speaking to the Guardian, Steve McQueen - a Bafta and Oscar winner for 12 Years a Slave - said the organisation risked cultural redundancy without urgent change.\nBoth the Baftas and Oscars have undertaken membership shakeups over the past five years in a bid to better reflect the diversity of both films and the wider world.\nIn 2017, a Bafta survey found that its members were 43% female, 18% minority ethnic and had a median age of 44; further intakes would likely have raised those figures further. Last year's ceremony was the first since a new set of eligibility rules, designed to increase inclusion, were introduced for two key awards.\nIn 2016, the Oscars announced an intention to double their number of female and minority voters by 2020; a goal that appears to have been achieved by enormous drafts of fresh members, including       \u00a0    842 new faces in 2019 - and, more controversially, taking voting privileges away from \"dormant\" members.\nThe nominations in 24 categories were read out by John Cho and Issa Rae in Hollywood, ahead of the ceremony on 9 February.

Oscars in February ranks high among them. It took 92 years for the Academy to finally anoint a non-English-language film as the year's best, and you couldn't ask for a more electrifying movie to claim the milestone than Bong Joon-ho's cool, crisp, genre-bending class-war thriller.\nBy the time cinemas shut down in March, Parasite had become the highest-grossing non-English-language film in UK box office history. If you missed it, its home entertainment release on Monday (on all major streaming platforms, as well as DVD and Blu-ray) should come as a particular treat. The film's intricate narrative reversals are best experienced with as little forewarning as possible, but it's no spoiler to say that it ranks among cinema's most ingenious revisions of an age-old genre: the home invasion movie. The premise of an impoverished working-class family posing as servants to cannily infiltrate an elegantly moneyed household is classical. Yet the social dynamics of the setup are subversive from the beginning, as Bong and his superb cast muddy and muddle our sympathies - the poorer family may technically be the invaders here, but who are the victims?Parasite joins Jordan Peele's ingenious, incendiary       \u00a0    Us (streaming on Now TV), a deconstruction of black double consciousness played for visceral chills, in challenging the conventional politics of the home invasion movie - which traditionally sides with rich, respectable folks in peril. In the golden age of Hollywood, the home invasion thriller usefully allowed studios to cut back on sets and production costs, zeroing in instead on their most gifted damsels in distress: see       \u00a0    Sorry, Wrong Number (Google Play) from 1948, an enjoyably schlocky little exploitation film in which Barbara Stanwyck's sickly heiress clocks that she's the target of a murder plot but can hardly leave her boudoir to do much about it.\nYou can see how its brand of claustrophobia filtered into William Wyler's more hard-boiled The Desperate Hours (YouTube), in which Humphrey Bogart leads a trio of convicts holding a nice suburban family hostage while they await their escape money, or       \u00a0    Wait Until Dark(Chili), in which Alan Arkin's violent thug storms the apartment of lovely, poor, blind, inadvertently drug-harbouring Audrey Hepburn - a static but nervy \"he's behind you\" setup that holds up rather well, thanks to Hepburn's expert angst.\nThese days, of course, home invasion plots are a staple of grislier exercises in terror. 2008's The Strangers (Google Play) remains underrated in its simple, tightly cranked preying on middle-class fears and privileges, like a more multiplex-friendly answer to the cold-blooded cat-and-mouse games Michael Haneke played with a family on holiday in       \u00a0    Funny Games (Amazon Prime) - the Austrian original, that is, not his own oddly pointless US remake. The 2006 French film       \u00a0    Them (available on Shudder) splits the difference between well-oiled genre mechanics and unorthodox arthouse cruelty. Following a family plagued by oddly diminutive forces at their country getaway, it's short, sharp and nakedly petrifying.\nSometimes more supernatural forces are at play: with its signature warning of \"they're heeeere\", the still crackling Poltergeist (Amazon) made a generation of children wonder what apparitions may be lurking in the living room TV set. Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's modern haunted house classic       \u00a0    The Others (iTunes), meanwhile, inverted its victim perspective with a twist so clean and brilliant that it's ominously being lined up for a remake. And who can even say what or who the invaders are in Darren Aronofsky's divisive but enthralling       \u00a0    Mother! (Amazon), a fevered psychotic breakdown of a film in which strangers leaning on her unbraced kitchen sink is the very least of young home renovator Jennifer Lawrence's problems.\nNot all home invasion movies have to be traumatising, however: the genre can accommodate unexpectedly tender love stories, as in Robin Campillo's excellent, unpredictable Eastern Boys (Amazon), in which a middle-aged gay man's attempt to anonymously hook up with a beautiful youth at his flat has both destructive and heart-bursting consequences. There's even such a thing as a home invasion romcom in the form of the irresistibly fizzy, silly       \u00a0    Housesitter (Amazon), in which Goldie Hawn's enterprising waitress pluckily colonises the unoccupied dream house of lovelorn architect Steve Martin. She's plainly a sociopath, but why should that impede true love? There isn't much to connect this fluff to Bong Joon-ho's gilded masterwork, save for its conviction that not every home invader is the bad guy.\n                                            Also new on DVD and streaming                                        \n                     Cats                     (Universal, U) If the baying reviews got you curious but you just couldn't face the uncanny onslaught of digital fur technology in the cinema, here it is for your home viewing displeasure.

When an unexpected development (no spoilers here) puts their scheme at risk, they're forced to hide in various corridors of the expansive house, under floorboards and in the walls. It's a startling visual embodiment of the class warfare at the heart of the movie \u2014 and in much of Bong's work, from 'Barking Dogs Never Bite' to 'Snowpiercer' \u2014 wherein less fortunate people attempt to take control of the conditions holding them down, and wind up stuck somewhere in the middle. \nBong's directorial talents were long overdue for this prize: His slick ability to compose rich visuals in every frame, with complex characters almost too driven for their own good, has made him one of the greatest working filmmakers for years now. But 'Parasite' was also an ideal choice for the top prize at this year's Cannes[2] in a year when many of the best movies in Competition dealt with the same potent theme. Consider 'Atlantics.' Mati Diop's surreal Grand Prix winner follows a group of women in Dakar abandoned by several young men who flee to the ocean in a quest to reach the coast of Spain. Ada (Mama San) is left to contend with a forced marriage to Omar (Barbara Sylla), a wealthy man whom her family hopes will support them. Ada feels trapped: On the one hand, she resents her lover abandoning her in a dreary, impoverished life; at the same time, she's expected to suppress her emotions for the sake of her family's stability. As 'Atlantics' heads in an eerie, supernatural direction, and the ghosts of men who departed for the sea come back to haunt Ada's small community, the movie creates the impression of a world defined by the haves and have-nots. Only through a profound, otherworldly set of circumstances can Ava even begin to contemplate the idea of an escape, but never once does it seem realistic. So it goes in 'Les Miserables' and 'Bacurau,' the movies that shared this year's Jury Prize. In Ladj Ly's 'Les Miserables,' thick-skulled police officers persecute a Muslim community in Paris for no reason other than their ongoing desire to confirm their superiority. Their mounting acts of aggression toward one rebellious Muslim youth lead to a dynamic showdown in an apartment complex when the entire neighborhood acts out in revolt. That ending is mirrored rather closely in 'Bacurau,' Kleber Mendonca Filho and Juliano Dornelles' futuristic Brazilian Western, when a remote town bands together to fight back against mysterious vigilantes. Their purpose hovers in an ambiguous state for much of the story, but they take on a profound symbolic quality as the movie builds to its bloody finale, as a self-sustaining world defined by its self-sustaining ethos suddenly must fight to sustain its existence. The stakes take on more personal ramifications in 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire,' Celine Sciamma's screenplay winner, which finds a wealthy young woman named Heloise (Adele Hanele) falling for lower-class painter Marianne (Nomie Merlant) in the 18th century. Their bond is powerful, intimate, and essentially impossible: While the movie doesn't waste time exploring the taboos associated with same-sex attraction at the time, remaining close to its main characters' developing bond, it magnifies just how much Heloise has been trapped by her palatial circumstances. As with Ada in 'Atlantics,' Heloise is expected to marry a man who can support her and keep her comfortable, but that assumption doesn't take into account what she actually wants for herself. Her love affair is a quiet act of rebellion against the system holding her in place. While the fixation of these Cannes entries suggests a mounting discontent with wealth and persecution around the world, Ken Loach got there first. The British auteur has been the ultimate chronicler of underclass frustrations for over half a century, and his Competition entry 'Sorry We Missed You' is a vintage example. Tackling the gig economy head-on, Loach focuses on desperate family man Ricky (Kris Hitchen) as he takes on a contract gig driving a delivery van around London, signing away his rights in the process. Loach excels at showing how vast industrial systems exploit the working man, and Ricky's innocuous descent into a machine keen on eating him alive is tragic to watch, mostly because it feels so real. Nevertheless, the narrative of this year's Cannes goes back to the beginning. Jim Jarmusch's 'The Dead Don't Die' opened the festival to lukewarm reviews, but the master of deadpan's dark zombie comedy is nothing if not a pointed critique of an exploitative system. The undead in Jarmusch's kooky ensemble are drawn to products that they obsessed over in their lives \u2014 wifi, Xanax, coffee, you name it \u2014 and it doesn't take much to see just how much contempt Jarmusch has for the way we've all become materialistic slaves. It's a blunt metaphor, explained in bitter terms in Tom Waits' apocalyptic voiceover, but in retrospect it set the stage for the festival's many depictions of global outrage against capitalist persecution. Wealth attracts and it takes away; in the process, it catalyzes dramatic narratives that must be told. Even bad movies can be portals to the fears, anxieties, and frustrations of the times in which they're made; the 2019 Cannes Film Festival brought us some great ones.

It's a real testament to the cinematography that all the care that went into the grading of the original can be removed and you feel like you're in another movie entirely.                   \nWith Bong Joon-ho's Oscar-winning masterpiece the black and white makes it look even more stylish - oh, that house! But it does more than that. It ramps up the feeling of opulence or poverty, depending on the setting.\nIt's a wonderful excuse to revisit this amazing film with fresh eyes. If it passed you by before, this subtitled, twisted and dark comedy from South Korea completely lives up to expectation. It's utterly marvellous. \nThe Kims are a four-piece family living in poverty. They have to contend with people urinating outside the window of their Seoul basement hovel, relying on the government to fumigate the streets so they can leave their window open to get the roaches out of their flat. It's grim and they're fed up with it.\nWhen an opportunity arises for their son to teach English to the daughter of a rich businessman, they plot to infiltrate the wealthy family's life and leech as many of them as they can.\nThey're grifters, chancers, liars and thieves but you're rooting for them. In stark difference, the Parks are super-cool, super-rich, happy but vacant. You don't dislike them but their ambivalence towards the lower classes grates. \nAs the Kims worm their way into the house, replacing staff one by one, you have no clue what will unfold - and nothing prepares you. Gripping. \n                     Parasite (Black & White), (15), 132mins                   \n                     *****                   \n                     Saint Frances                   \nON the face of it, Saint Frances appeared to be your standard \"thirty-somethings don't really know what they want\" fare - but by the time I was through with it, I was hooked.\nWritten by and starring newcomer Kelly O'Sullivan, we begin with the central character Bridget making two decisions that set the film on its path. \nOne sees her hired as the nanny of a six-year-old girl, Frances, and the other leads to her having a medical abortion. \nAs she begins to develop her relationship with Frances - played wonderfully by Ramona-Edith Williams - the slow-burning psychological effects of her abortion linger. \nAt the coalface with a family dealing with their own career-juggling, and post-natal depression, Bridget quest-ions whether she was, or ever will be, ready for the same. As far as plot goes, there is very little of it. This is more a case of a 30-year-old woman questioning her life and meandering through in her own time. \nWhether that involves religion, period sex, gaslighting, breastfeeding in public or admission of parental failure doesn't particularly matter. \nThese everyday, mostly female dilemmas are delivered in such a way you're initially jarred by the blas\u00e9 and detached nature of it all - but this is the film's real strength. \nThere's more left unsaid in Saint Frances than is heavily signposted in most others - and Kelly O'Sullivan has just delivered us a cult classic.\n                     Saint Frances, (15), 100mins                    \n                     *****                   \n                     GOT a story?

Winner of the Palme d'Or in the latest edition of the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film (and that's just for the better two awards in a long list of awards), included in a list of best films released in the year 2019 for the places he passed and almost certainly nominated for the 2020 Oscar for best foreign film. As if this were not enough, Parasite has managed to reap, in addition to prestige, a lot of popularity both within and outside its country of origin. Something that is due, above all, to its narrative merits and its unpredictable handling of suspense.\nFor those who never saw anything from its director Bong Joon Ho, a film like Parasite will probably prove completely surprising. Those who, on the other hand, know this filmmaker, will appreciate in Parasite tones and themes very typical of one of the most important directors of contemporary cinema. To locate this director throughout his career, he has so far been making seven feature film and belongs to a generation of new filmmakers from South Korea that have emerged since the mid-1990s.\nThere are, to say some notable names (whether for the quality of their films, whether because of the enormous popularity of some of their feature films): Lee Chang Dong, Park Chan Wook, Kim Ki Duk, Hong Sang so, or Yeong Sang Ho. Some of them knew how to make commercial films different from the usual ones, which knew how to reread American genres by moving them to the streets of their country. Bong was always an expert on this last art. In fact, his films are often rabidly funny and feature shocking scenes. A quality that caught the attention of American producers who summoned him twice (the remarkable Snowpiecer and the failed Okja, made for Netflix) to direct major action and adventure productions.\nHis particularly striking and lucid cinema also made his prestige in the worlds of festivals and in a movie-goers audience appeared immediately. In fact, after an interesting but failed first film like Barking Dog Never Bites (Flandersui Gae-2000), he made a policeman called Memoirs of a Killer (Salinui chueok-2003), perhaps his first masterpiece.\nThere Bong recounted the story of a cruel serial killer and rapist who had young girls as victims. What seems to start as a conventional police officer where you have to catch a murderer in a small town, ends up drifting in a completely different place. Gradually, subtly, what ends up happening is the story of two detectives desperately trying to find a criminal who is not only beyond his capabilities but also beyond a police bureaucracy with precarious technology and a preparation in some cases practically zero. Memoirs of a Killer was Bong's first surprising film that revolved around two things that this director is obsessed with.\nBong Joon Ho and the Palm of Gold of Cannes by \"Parasite\" (REUTERS/Stephane Mahe) (Stephane Mahe/)\nOn the one hand, a cinematic idea: Bong has been well aware throughout his filmography that there are certain types of genres that can no longer be narrated in the same way and that can only be recovered by transgressing completely. In this way, he remeans the policeman in the aforementioned Memoirs of a Murderer, but also in Mother, a feature film that Bong would make in 2009 about a mother desperately trying to find a murdererbefore your child is convicted of a crime he did not commit. Meanwhile, in The Host (a 2003 film and perhaps his greatest masterpiece to date), he remeans monster cinema confronting a powerful and huge aquatic bug with a South Korean fringe family who must challenge both the fantasy spawn and a device this Korean and a paranoid society. In Snowpiecer, Bong focuses on a dystopian universe of action and science fiction in which he uses a furious political commentary on class division and the construction of systematic lies for population subjugation.\nIn all these cases there is a strong imprint of political and social cinema, an interest that in the case of Bong Joo Ho connects even with his own academic title (before dedicating himself to film graduated as a sociologist). Within these social interests, what persists most is a personal look at power relations. Not only because in his cinema there are tensions of class or authority (which most of the time is the same thing), but because more than once that power manifests itself awkwardly and even unconsciously. A clear example of this is in The Host. What stands out is that military forces can not only be cruel, but can lack all common sense and surrender to obedience of a greater power (in this case that of the United States) without squeaking. In Memoirs of a Killer, for example, small-town policemen use confessions via torture not only because of a context of widespread violence (the film takes place during a right-wing dictatorship that Suffered South Korea in the 1980s), but because of the they lack too much intelligence, and even in Okja the main villains present theself as a set of grotesque people who end up being overtaken in cunning by a teenage girl.\nOf course, so much emphasis on the improbability or ignorance of certain characters results in more than one occasion when Bong's cinema uses, and much, satire and humor. But it is also true that the stupidity or ignorance of some of his characters is not only comical but also harmful and tragic. And this is where we enter one of the most amazing features of its cinema: its unpredictability. Whoever enters Bong Joon Ho's world enters a universe where anything seems to happen. His cinema is rich in narrative twists, and abrupt record changes that make it quickly move from the comical to the terrible. However, the interesting thing about your cinema is that these record changes, while looking rough at first glance, end up revealing as logical when you review the film or even finish thinking about it. I mean, Bong's cinema may be unpredictable, but this unpredictability is never free. Deep down, it ends up being a hopeful consequence, sometimes even logical both by the environment in which their characters live and by their own decisions.\nParasite is a perfect example of the latter aspect. Its plot revolves around a marginal family group in South Korea that uses the scam to gradually inhabit the home of a wealthy family. Their strategy will be that, progressively, each family member is occupying a different position, both from the servitude and the particular teaching staff of his children. At some point, Parasite is thematically twinned with two particularly resonant American films from last year: Us, by Jordan Peele, and especially Joker, by Todd Phillips. All these feature films have in common a similar idea: to present ourselves with a society divided into two classesvery marked social saloons, of which the lowest are furious and eager to occupy more privileged places as they may be, and the highest completely ignorant of what is happening with the most unfortunate sectors.\nHowever, there is one thing that makes Parasite very different from the other two: people who occupy privileged places are not shown at any time with contempt. Their petty attitudes, while they may exist, not necessarily make them horrible villains or even bad people, but simply people who were lucky enough to be born in peaceful places where they could build a much better future. In any case, what gave them that privileged life is a world surrounded by a bubble of happiness that made them very naive for certain things, who do not know who are the people who entered their house or fully know each corner of their  own housing.\nConsidering the way rich characters are described, and the criminal actions of the less privileged, Parasite can prove to be a deceptively misanthropic film. But the truth is that misanthropy is a feeling that comes from the idea of thinking an evil man in his nature. Bong, on the other hand, does not think that his characters are evil, but that they are the product of a certain circumstance. In fact, there is no vile attitude on Parasite that one cannot end up understanding by the very context that its characters suffer. To the point this is so that until killing can turn towards the end an understandable attitude derived from characters who have reached a point of madness that should not be revealed.\nIn any case, at Parasite everything seems to be a matter of environments. Hence also in the film the figure of the architectural is so important. The rich are enchanted by the beautiful design of their large house in which they can stay protected and safe from threats; while the poor suffer in fragile houses, located in the worst possible place, where even something as common as heavy rain can be a threat. In these fragile existences, as one of the lower-class characters will say at one point in the film, you can't plan, you can't think medium or long-term because everything is permanently linked to survival after all. At some point then, that enchantment that poor characters have over the beautiful mansions is not necessarily frivolous or superficial: it is rather a logical attitude in the search for a shell that allows them to go for their life with greater security. And at some point too, the abrupt record changes of this film are not only part of a style mark of its director, but also a reflection of unstable stocks, which can be altered overnight with as sharpness as the very tone of a film at the same time comedic, tragic and desperate time.\nParasite is a bitter and rabid lystered reflection of such lives; one that manages to talk about poverty without miserabilisms, or demagogic gestures, and about class divisions without a Matic conception. All in all, one of those happily different feature films, which cinema delivers very occasionally.\nRead\nPolanski and the crossroads between the accuser and the accused: allegations that do not cease and the boycott of his films\nTen Argentine movie movies to enjoy free via streaming"}, {"text": "The indie distributor Neon has Oscar contenders with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s latest and the documentary \u201cApollo 11.\u201d\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was not a surprise that critics would love \u201cParasite,\u201d the latest film from the acclaimed director       \u00a0    Bong Joon Ho. But box-office success for this sometimes funny, sometimes horrifying Korean-language tale of economic inequality was no sure thing. Enter Tom Quinn, the head of Neon, a rising independent film distributor and production company.\nMr. Quinn, who had worked with Mr. Bong on four of his earlier movies, secured the North American distribution rights to \u201cParasite\u201d on the strength of the script in October last year. He was there at the Cannes Film Festival in May, when the film received an eight-minute standing ovation and the festival\u2019s highest award, the Palme d\u2019Or. After returning home, Mr. Quinn saw it once more in a theater. He said he had cried through the ending.\nThat was months before a theatrical run that has defied assumptions about the entertainment industry at a time when streaming has threatened the cinematic experience and movies with superheroes are among the few surefire       \u00a0    box-office bets.\nSince rolling out internationally over the summer and in North American theaters last month, \u201cParasite\u201d has grossed more than $114 million worldwide. Domestically, where it has played on 620 screens, it is still going strong, having earned more than $16 million. Mr. Bong, the director, said he appreciated working with someone like Mr. Quinn, an executive unjaded enough to weep in a movie theater.\n\u201cI was a little taken aback when I heard that,\u201d Mr. Bong said in an email. \u201cUsually, distributors focus on analyzing and luring the audience through marketing campaigns, which is of course necessary. But Tom can still put himself into the audience. I think that\u2019s pretty unique.\u201d\nMr. Quinn, 49, is not one for the sky-is-falling mentality that has gripped much of Hollywood. He has built Neon into a power among independent distributors with an old-school formula: trusting his taste and paying to acquire intelligent films that audiences will pay to see in theaters.\n\u201cWhere else can we create this communal experience?\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a little bit of fellowship, a lot of fun and it only happens in church, school and the theaters. I think there is something very sacred about that.\u201d\nHe started Neon in 2017 with Tim League, the founder of the Alamo Drafthouse theater chain, who is no longer involved in the company\u2019s daily operations. In addition to \u201cParasite,\u201d Neon scored this year with the documentary\u201cApollo 11,\u201d which had a 38-week theatrical run on its way to earning more than $16 million worldwide.\nWhile box-office revenue for independent films was sinking during the first half of the year, down 36 percent, according to the box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian, Neon also found success with the Aretha Franklin documentary \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d which played in theaters for 50 weeks starting last December.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve helped reignite interest in theatrical documentaries,\u201d Stephen Gilula, a co-chairman of Fox Searchlight, said of Neon.\n\u201cParasite\u201d is practically guaranteed an Oscar nomination in the international category \u2014 a would-be first for a South Korean film \u2014 and has a strong chance of a best picture nomination. Neon\u2019s marketing of the film, including a cryptic Instagram account, is in keeping with the tantalizing campaigns for earlier movies that included surprise plot developments like \u201cThe Sixth Sense,\u201d \u201cThe Crying Game\u201d and \u201cPsycho.\u201d\n\u201cLooking at Neon\u2019s original and witty marketing campaigns, I can feel the energy that comes with being a young company and a young distributor,\u201d Mr. Bong said.\nAfter working at a video store when he was a student at the University of North Carolina, Mr. Quinn started his career at Samuel Goldwyn Films before joining Magnolia Pictures, where he discovered Mr. Bong\u2019s \u201cThe Host\u201d and its follow-up, \u201cMother.\u201d\nIn 2011 he went to work for Harvey Weinstein, starting Radius-TWC, a label at the Weinstein Company. In that job Mr. Quinn protected Mr. Bong\u2019s 126-minute cut of the 2013 thriller \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d from the boss, who was known as Harvey Scissorhands for his tendency to cut films in the editing room. Mr. Quinn left in 2015, two years before the company imploded after sexual misconduct allegations against Mr. Weinstein, and little by little he raised $30 million to get Neon off the ground.\nThe company, which has 27 employees, became a player at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017, when it joined with the media investment company 30West to beat out Netflix for the domestic rights to \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d despite offering considerably less money, Mr. Quinn said. \u201cI, Tonya\u201d went on to make $30 million in theaters and won a best supporting actress Oscar for Allison Janney, who played the mother of the protagonist, the figure skater Tonya Harding.\nMr. Quinn said Neon had often found itself in competition with Netflix. \u201cA lot of times the money is the same, and a lot of times the money is three times what we are offering,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they are offering it without a guarantee of a theatrical window or even a theatrical qualifying window. And we are committed to the theatrical experience.\u201d\nLast year 30West bought a controlling interest in Neon, which has offices in New York and Los Angeles. The deal has given the company some protection in an industry littered with studios and distributors that have flamed out after hot streaks. Neon will thrive if Mr. Quinn\u2019s eclectic taste continues to match up with what audiences want.\nA recent disappointment centered on the French film \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d a period romance from the writer-director C\u00e9line Sciamma. Neon acquired the North American rights to the film with Hulu, the streaming service controlled by the Walt Disney Company, and will release it Dec. 6. The early reviews were ecstatic, and it won the best screenplay award at Cannes, but its awards prospects took a hit when France selected Ladj Ly\u2019s \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d as the film it would submit to the 2020 Oscars.\n\u201cIt was extremely disappointing,\u201d Mr. Quinn said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could talk for a day. I was really sad for C\u00e9line.\u201d\nPHOTOS: A scene from \u201cParasite,\u201d which has grossed more than $114 million worldwide.

Earlier this year, \"Parasite\" became the first South Korean movie to win the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. It's the latest picture from Bong Joon-ho, the director of \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja,\" and it could also become the first Korean movie to receive an Oscar nomination as Best International Feature Film, the category formerly known as Best Foreign Language Film. Our film critic Justin Chang says \"Parasite\" is a masterful new work from one of the world's most exciting filmmakers.             \nJUSTIN CHANG:                 I was fortunate enough to go into \"Parasite\" knowing almost nothing about it. Bong Joon-ho's brilliant new movie packs the kinds of stunning, multilayered surprises that deserve to be experienced as fresh as possible. I'll tread as cautiously as I can, but suffice to say that \"Parasite\" is a darkly comic thriller about two families - the Parks, who are very rich, and the Kims, who are very poor.             \n                Mr. and Mrs. Kim live with their son Ki-woo and their daughter Ki-jung in a cramped apartment in Seoul. Years of poverty have made them shrewd, resilient and tough and not above the occasional petty theft. Like the family in last year's great Japanese drama \"Shoplifters,\" they've managed to survive by relying on their wits and on each other. One day, Ki-woo, a high school graduate, gets a job as an English tutor for an upper-class teenage girl named Da-hye. Her father Mr. Park is a millionaire tech titan, and they live in a gated, modernist fortress of a house designed by a famous architect.             \n                Ki-woo begins visiting the house to give his English lessons, and it's there that he meets Mrs. Park, who let slip that she's looking for an art teacher for her mischief-making young son. Thinking fast, Ki-woo mentions a distant acquaintance who might be good for the job, and within days, his sister Ki-jung has been hired as a very expensive tutor. The Kims enjoy their sudden boost in income, even as they strain to keep the Parks in the dark about their family connection and their lack of proper credentials. But the lies don't end there, and their scheme grows only more dangerous in its ambition.             \n                For roughly its first hour, \"Parasite\" is the most deviously entertaining con artist thriller I've seen in years. Director Bong pulls the pieces together with the elegance and flair of a conductor attacking a great symphony. Inch by inch, the Kims expand their domain. No piece of information, whether it's the matter of the housekeeper's allergy or the sexual habits of Mr. Park's driver, is too trivial to be used to their advantage. Bong draws us into a wicked sense of complicity with the Kims, who, for all their duplicity, are never hard to root for.             \n                But as fun as it is to see the Parks get hoodwinked, Bong doesn't turn them into easy villains. We see how gullible and vulnerable they are behind their bolted doors and a high-tech security system. We see the cracks in their perfect family facade. The actress Jo Yeo-jeong gives an especially nuanced performance as Mrs. Park, who, for all her breezy entitlement, lives in the shadow of her cold, unfeeling husband.             \n                The Kims, by contrast, are a model of intimacy and fairness. When money and space are this tight, everyone has to pull their weight. They depend on each other so completely that they seem to function less like individuals than like a single organism. Maybe that makes them the parasite of the title, or maybe not. As the movie races toward a suspenseful and terrifying conclusion, it leaves little doubt as to whether the haves or the have-nots represent the greater scourge in a capitalist society.             \n                Bong has always been deft at synthesizing thrills and politics. He previously tackled class warfare in his English-language thriller \"Snowpiercer,\" but \"Parasite\" feels even more closely related to his wonderful 2006 monster movie \"The Host,\" which also followed a desperate family trying to survive. The star of \"The Host\" was the popular actor Song Kang-ho, who returns and parasite as Mr. Kim and gradually becomes the movie's angry moral center. More than his wife or kids, he understands what it means to be looked down on by people like the Parks and regarded as less than human.             \n                At first, you're right there with the Kims until the story takes the first of many jaw-dropping turns. \"Parasite\" is seamless in the way it shuffles moods, tones and genres and downright Hitchcockian in the way it manipulates your sympathies. It's a movie of extraordinary cunning and devastating emotional power, and after three viewings, I'm still not sure quite how to classify it. Is it a comedy or a tragedy, a thriller or a satire, an art film or popular entertainment? Maybe it's best to simply call it what it is - a masterpiece.             \nTERRY GROSS:                 Justin Chang is a film critic at The L.A. Times.

Bong is heavily expected to pick up nods for best director and original screenplay as well, following a similar path to awards glory blazed by Alfonso Cuaron's black-and-white \"Roma,\" which won Mexico its first best foreign-language film Oscar last February.\nSo what's all the fuss about, and what do you need to know going in? USA TODAY sat down with Bong and the film's stars to get the inside scoop.\nIt's an 'Avengers'-level minefield of potential spoilers\n\"Parasite\" is a twisty, bloody thrill ride that is best enjoyed if you go in blind.\n\"Don't look up anything prior,\" advises actress Park So-dam. \"Just come in without any expectation and no knowledge of the film.\"\nBut if you need a little bit more to go off of, here's the basic gist: Initially envisioned by Bong as a play and set almost entirely indoors, \"Parasite\" tells the story of two disparate families: the impoverished Kims, who live in a cramped, subterranean apartment doing odd jobs to make ends meet; and the affluent Parks, whose cushy lifestyle is dutifully run by a small army of chauffeurs, housekeepers and tutors.\nThe charismatic but uneducated Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) cons his way into an English tutoring gig for the Parks' teenage daughter (Jung Ziso), and slowly begins to infiltrate their home: He cleverly deceives the Parks into firing their staff, and convinces them to hire his sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam), mom Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) and dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). But the Kims' get-rich scheme goes violently off the rails in the film's suspenseful second half, descending into chaos that packs an emotional wallop.\n'Parasite' isn't a horror\nmovie - or is it?\nAlthough its crawly title suggests bloodsucking body horror, the R-rated thriller is rarely scary and only occasionally gory.\n\"When the film begins, it feels like your typical  dark comedy film, so the audience can just relax and watch it,\" Bong says. \"Halfway through, there's a turning point that leads to all these uncontrollable situations and the audience doesn't have time to wonder, 'What is the genre?' They're just dragged to the end point without any time to consider what's going on. So when they leave the theater, the audience just gives up on trying to define the genre, and that's what I wanted.\"\nThe film explores class divides\nin darkly funny fashion\nTo often literal effect, \"Parasite\" shows the upstairs-downstairs dichotomy between rich and poor, as the Kims attempt to better their hapless circumstances under the feet of the blithe Park family.\n\"The messages (Bong) is trying to give people about poverty differences and problems are universal,\" Choi says. \"It has a lot of meanings and metaphors, and you can actually have a conversation about it after.\"\nThe movie's title is even up for interpretation: \"A parasite is an entity that feeds off another thing, but if you look at the film, it's not important to designate which side is parasitic,\" Song says. \"Certain characters are parasitic, but the message of the film is that everyone in society has to live in harmony and have respect toward one another.\"\nYou'll never look at\npeaches the same again\nIn a movie chock-full of striking imagery, one of the most memorable is that of a peach, which Ki-jung scrapes of its fuzz. Stealthily, she sprinkles the fuzz on the Parks' unassuming maid, who is fiercely allergic and falls ill on the job. Fearing she'll infect their kids, the Parks fire the housekeeper on the spot.\nThe fruit has become the unofficial \"mascot\" of \"Parasite\": Strings of peach emojis frequently accompany tweets about the movie.\n\"Peaches are the most cinematic (food), just in terms of the visual aesthetics and the fact that the fuzz is barely visible, so it's easy to attack someone with,\" Bong says.\nCoincidentally, peaches were also central to another recent awards heavyweight: 2017's \"Call Me By Your Name,\" in which Timothee Chalamet's Elio pleasures himself with the fruit. Bong laughs off the connection between the two films, deadpanning, \"I hope it helps all the peach farmers across the world.\""}, {"text": "BONG HIVE STAND UUUUUP! The Oscars were this past Sunday night, and for the first time since \"Moonlight\" blindsided everyone, especially Warren Beatty, in 2016, I felt real justice from the Academy and its voters. \"Parasite,\" a film directed by acclaimed Korean director Bong Joon Ho, became the first movie not in the English language to win best picture. And if that was not enough of a prize, it also took home awards for Best International Feature, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. I plan on reviewing it properly sometime later in the term when more people have seen it because I am not sure I will be able to review it without spoilers. So go check it out now because it is available to stream as we speak!\nMoving into this Oscars season, many fans were gunning for \"Parasite\" to win major awards but feared industry guild and academy members were not quite ready to recognize a non-English language film with some of their highest honors. Even though \"Parasite\" won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, that was no guarantee of success in the U.S. awards circuit. However, that expectation started to change towards the end of this awards season when \"Parasite\" began to sweep major guild awards including the Screen Writers Guild Award for Best Original Screenplay and the SAG Award for Best Performance by a Cast in Motion Picture. Big wins at these guild awards tend to indicate higher chances of a film receiving top honors at the Oscars. Then, lo and behold, come the biggest night in Hollywood, it was four Oscar trophies for Director Bong and his collaborators.\nThere is a lot to be happy about with these wins. A \"foreign language film\" taking home awards in these important categories signifies that film is becoming a truly international industry. Bong Joon Ho has thrown a great deal of shade at American audiences and Hollywood in general this season, calling the Oscars a \"local\" awards show and encouraging audiences to get over the \"one inch barrier\" of subtitles. Hopefully these wins and an impressive and ever-increasing domestic box office gross for \"Parasite\" signify that American film audiences are opening up to non-English language films and international film in general. I would also hope it encourages more U.S. production companies to take a chance on American multilingual films like \"The Farewell\" (dir. Lulu Wang), the winner of Best Feature at this year's Independent Spirit Awards.\nThen, finally, it is just an absolute delight to see Bong Joon Ho enjoy his success and be overwhelmed with the entire experience of winning four Oscars in a night. His little giggle while staring at his first Oscar statue and the ever so quotable, \"I will drink until next morning,\" were just a couple highlights of Director Bong's speeches. Also, he made two of his Oscars Statues kiss each other, which was adorable. Director Bong said gay rights! But all joking aside, \"Parasite\" taking Best Picture is going to be a win and a movie that we remember for years to come, and I only hope that it is the first sign of a shift towards international inclusivity in a very rigid industry.\nThe rest of the night went mostly as planned: Roger Deakins rightfully received the Best Cinematography award for his impressive work on \"1917.\" A master of the craft, Deakins was instrumental in creating the illusion of \"1917's\" one continuous take.\nHildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir took home the award for Best Original Score. Readers of my column will recall that I singled her out as one of the only things I liked in the movie \"Joker.\" I especially appreciated her acceptance speech where she encouraged young women to hear the music in their hearts and speak up. Though she is not the first woman to receive that award, I look forward to women who win Best Original Score down the line citing her and her speech as a point of inspiration.\nThe four acting category winners were consistent with previous awards ceremonies this season. Laura Dern and Brad Pitt won Best Supporting Actress for \"Marriage Story\" and Best Supporting Actor for \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" respectively. Renee Zellweger won Best Actress for her portrayal of Judy Garland in \"Judy,\" and Joaquin Phoenix gave a truly bizarre speech about human rights and not artificially inseminating cows while accepting his Best Actor Award for \"Joker.\"\nThough the actual ceremony was a bit rough and disjointed, the lack of a host allowed to show more footage of performances, a full segment for a medley of Best Original Score nominees and long speech times for artists who deserve their recognition and a moment to acknowledge those who made their success possible. People introducing people who then introduced a clip which introduced Eminem aside, it was a fine ceremony with many earned wins and joyful moments. #BONGHIVE"}, {"text": "The indie distributor Neon has Oscar contenders with Bong Joon Ho's latest and the documentary \"Apollo 11.\"\nLOS ANGELES - It was not a surprise that critics would love \"Parasite,\" the latest film from the acclaimed director Bong Joon Ho. But box-office success for this sometimes funny, sometimes horrifying Korean-language tale of economic inequality was no sure thing. Enter Tom Quinn, the head of Neon, a rising independent film distributor and production company.\nMr. Quinn, who had worked with Mr. Bong on four of his earlier movies, secured the North American distribution rights to \"Parasite\" on the strength of the script in October last year. He was there at the Cannes Film Festival in May, when the film received an eight-minute standing ovation and the festival's highest award, the Palme d'Or. After returning home, Mr. Quinn saw it once more in a theater. He said he had cried through the ending.\nThat was months before a theatrical run that has defied assumptions about the entertainment industry at a time when streaming has threatened the cinematic experience and movies with superheroes are among the few surefire box-office bets.\nSince rolling out internationally over the summer and in North American theaters last month, \"Parasite\" has grossed more than $114 million worldwide. Domestically, where it has played on 620 screens, it is still going strong, having earned more than $16 million. Mr. Bong, the director, said he appreciated working with someone like Mr. Quinn, an executive unjaded enough to weep in a movie theater.\n\"I was a little taken aback when I heard that,\" Mr. Bong said in an email. \"Usually, distributors focus on analyzing and luring the audience through marketing campaigns, which is of course necessary. But Tom can still put himself into the audience. I think that's pretty unique.\"\nMr. Quinn, 49, is not one for the sky-is-falling mentality that has gripped much of Hollywood. He has built Neon into a power among independent distributors with an old-school formula: trusting his taste and paying to acquire intelligent films that audiences will pay to see in theaters.\n\"Where else can we create this communal experience?\" he said. \"It has a little bit of fellowship, a lot of fun and it only happens in church, school and the theaters. I think there is something very sacred about that.\"\nHe started Neon in 2017 with Tim League, the founder of the Alamo Drafthouse theater chain, who is no longer involved in the company's daily operations. In addition to \"Parasite,\" Neon scored this year with the documentary \"Apollo 11,\" which had a 38-week theatrical run on its way to earning more than $16 million worldwide.\nWhile box-office revenue for independent films was sinking during the first half of the year, down 36 percent, according to the box office analyst Paul Dergarabedian, Neon also found success with the Aretha Franklin documentary \"Amazing Grace,\" which played in theaters for 50 weeks starting last December.\n\"They've helped reignite interest in theatrical documentaries,\" Stephen Gilula, a co-chairman of Fox Searchlight, said of Neon.\n\"Parasite\" is practically guaranteed an Oscar nomination in the international category - a would-be first for a South Korean film - and has a strong chance of a best picture nomination. Neon's marketing of the film, including a cryptic Instagram account, is in keeping with the tantalizing campaigns for earlier movies that included surprise plot developments like \"The Sixth Sense,\" \"The Crying Game\" and \"Psycho.\"\n\"Looking at Neon's original and witty marketing campaigns, I can feel the energy that comes with being a young company and a young distributor,\" Mr. Bong said.\nAfter working at a video store when he was a student at the University of North Carolina, Mr. Quinn started his career at Samuel Goldwyn Films before joining Magnolia Pictures, where he discovered Mr. Bong's \"The Host\" and its follow-up, \"Mother.\"\nIn 2011 he went to work for Harvey Weinstein, starting Radius-TWC, a label at the Weinstein Company. In that job Mr. Quinn protected Mr. Bong's 126-minute cut of the 2013 thriller \"Snowpiercer\" from the boss, who was known as Harvey Scissorhands for his tendency to cut films in the editing room. Mr. Quinn left in 2015, two years before the company imploded after sexual misconduct allegations against Mr. Weinstein, and little by little he raised $30 million to get Neon off the ground.\nThe company, which has 27 employees, became a player at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017, when it joined with the media investment company 30West to beat out Netflix for the domestic rights to \"I, Tonya,\" despite offering considerably less money, Mr. Quinn said. \"I, Tonya\" went on to make $30 million in theaters and won a best supporting actress Oscar for Allison Janney, who played the mother of the protagonist, the figure skater Tonya Harding.\nMr. Quinn said Neon had often found itself in competition with Netflix. \"A lot of times the money is the same, and a lot of times the money is three times what we are offering,\" he said. \"But they are offering it without a guarantee of a theatrical window or even a theatrical qualifying window. And we are committed to the theatrical experience.\"\nLast year 30West bought a controlling interest in Neon, which has offices in New York and Los Angeles. The deal has given the company some protection in an industry littered with studios and distributors that have flamed out after hot streaks. Neon will thrive if Mr. Quinn's eclectic taste continues to match up with what audiences want.\nA recent disappointment centered on the French film \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire,\" a period romance from the writer-director C\u00e9line Sciamma. Neon acquired the North American rights to the film with Hulu, the streaming service controlled by the Walt Disney Company, and will release it Dec. 6. The early reviews were ecstatic, and it won the best screenplay award at Cannes, but its awards prospects took a hit when France selected Ladj Ly's \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" as the film it would submit to the 2020 Oscars.\n\"It was extremely disappointing,\" Mr. Quinn said. \"I don't think I could talk for a day. I was really sad for C\u00e9line.\""}, {"text": "Hollywood just wouldn't be Hollywood without the Oscars - and just in the nick of time, this year's ceremony proved why.\nThe win for Parasite is the Academy's answer to a public tired of predictable wins and a lack of diversity. The 2020 nominations were most notable for who was left out: only one person of colour picked up a nomination in the acting categories, while no female directors got the nod. \nClearly then, they might not always get it right - but since 1929, the Academy Awards have been committed to celebrating the greatest films ever made.\nAnd while the Best Picture choices can be divisive - you won't find 1999's Shakespeare In Love, 2006's Crash or       \u00a0    controversial 2019 winner Green Book anywhere near this list - it's still by far the most significant award in film, and arguably even popular culture as a whole.\nFrom legendary movies of the 40s and 50s, right up to contemporary classics, these are the greatest Oscar winners of all time.\n                     Gone With The Wind (1939)                   \nGone With The Wind set the blueprint for the countless dramas of Hollywood's Golden Age that followed: a couple embark on a passionate but turbulent relationship, with things ending in tumultuous circumstances. It might be a familiar formula, but Gone With The Wind has never been matched for emotional poignancy. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are peerless in the 1939 classic, whichs plays out against the backdrop of the American Civil War.\nAlthough the Oscars began more than a decade previously, Gone With the Wind is one of the the first winners still widely celebrated by mainstream audiences today, though the film's attitudes to race are undoubtedly deeply problematic - New York Post critic Lou Lumenick is just one to criticise the film for romanticising slavery, called for it to be banned in 2015.\nIn 1939 though, the thoughts of the Academy were well aligned with popular opinion. As well as being lauded by critics, it was the biggest commercial success of its time, with its box office takings coming in at around $393m - \u00a33.4 billion when adjusted for inflation. One of the biggest success stories at the Awards at the time, it took the prize for Outstanding Production, Best Director for Victor Fleming, Best Supporting Actress for Hattie McDaniel and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n                     Casablanca (1943)                   \nEven seven decades on from its release, the chemistry of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca has yet to be matched in Hollywood. The pair's aching, on-off romance is as turbulent as the film's war-torn backdrop, and beautifully realised by two actors at the absolute peak of their powers. From the first moment they're seen together on screen, the viewer buys into the couple's past, present and future - whatever that may be. \nCasablanca manages to be sweeping and grandiose in its outlook, while also capturing a searing romantic intimacy. It is rightly regarded as of the defining movies of Hollywood's golden age and one of the most enduring love stories in film. Fans have also got the incredible screenplay to thank for some of the most quotable moments in film history - \"Of all the gin joints in all the towns...\", \"Here's looking at you, kid\" and \"Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\" to name but a few.\nThe decision to eschew a cliched happy ending have helped the film's legacy live on too. The heartbreaking final scenes gave the movie whole new layer of pathos, ensuring it could never be pigeonholed as just another doe-eyed romance from the war. \n                     All About Eve (1950)                   \nAll About Eve marked a breakthrough for the Academy in 1950, becoming the first movie with a predominantly female cast to win Best Picture.\nThe film, which follows the insidious relationship between a fading Broadway star and a younger fan, features a career-best performance from Bette Davis. She's fabulous as leading lady Margo Channing, who begins to fear the threat of Anne Baxter's superfan Eve Harrington after allowing her into her inner circle.\nThe movie also features one of the earliest performances from Marilyn Monroe - an unknown at the time, who would go on to breakthrough with Gentlemen Prefer Blondes a few years later.\n                     The Apartment (1960)                   \nAfter making his name with films like The Lost Weekend in 1945 and Sunset Boulevard in 1950, Billy Wilder turned in two of the greatest romantic comedies ever made in the space of a year; Some Like It Hot and The Apartment.\nIn many ways, the Best Picture-winning latter is the perfect movie: there are tears and laughter in equal measure, with a tenderness that never tips over into sentimentality. Jack Lemmon is brilliant as extorted businessman CC \"Bud\" Baxter, who falls for Shirley MacLaine's Fran Kubelik in unfortunate circumstances. The actor was integral to the success of both Some Like It Hot and the Apartment, expertly treading the line between comedy and tragedy and developing a wonderful chemistry with the excellent MacLaine. It's an ineffably beautiful film, which just proves that comedies don't always get overlooked at the Oscars.\n                     Lawrence of Arabia (1962)                   \nSome of the most stunning choreography ever put to screen can be found in Lawrence of Arabia, an epic historical drama from director David Lean. Peter O'Toole delivered a star-making performance as the titular TE Lawrence, the British Lieutenant who played a key role during the British army's Sinai and Palestine campaigns of WWI. Omar Sharif is also fabulous as Hashemite Arab leader Sherif Ali, who developed great on-screen chemistry with O'Toole. \nIt's breathtaking in its scale, mixing technical achievement, grandiose staging and choreography with intimate character studies. The film is a towering achievement of cinema, with O'Toole - possessor of the most striking blue eyes in cinema - right at the heart of its success.\n                     The Godfather (1972)                   \nThe Godfather is so synonymous with greatness, it's sometimes taken for granted just how close to cinematic perfection the film gets. \nThe incredible cinematography and atmosphere of the piece is testament Francis Ford Coppola's position as one of the leading filmmakers in Hollywood history - something he'd go on to prove with Apocalypse Now four years later.\nCoppola's masterpiece features a host of powerhouse performances from the likes of Robert Duvall, James Caan, and not least Marlon Brando - who Coppola had to fight hard to cast in the film at the time, following a string of disappointing roles and a controversial performance in Last Tango in Paris. Talia Shire, Diane Keaton and John Cazale are also superb, while the movie marked Al Pacino as one of the finest actors of his generation. \nThe movie picked up Best Picture, as well as Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Actor for Brando. The Godfather II followed, famously becoming the only sequel to ever win the Best Picture Oscar.\n                     One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)                   \nJack Nicholson was on the most charismatic form of his career in this adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The film takes a nuanced look at mental illness, exploring power dynamics in an Oregon psychiatric hospital and the draconian conditions inmates are kept in.\nNicholson plays repeat offender Randle McMurphy, who is moved to the institution from prison and encounters the tyrannical Nurse Ratched - one of the most subtly unnerving movie villains ever, played to perfection by Louise Fletcher.\nThe movie was as hilarious at it was harrowing, and despite strong competition from Dog Day Afternoon and Jaws, its brilliance was recognised with Oscars for Best Picture, Lead Actor, Lead Actress, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n                     The Silence Of The Lambs (1992)                   \nJonathan Demme's unforgettable Silence of the Lambs became only the third film ever to win the big five Oscars at the 1992 ceremony: Best Picture, Lead Actor, Lead Actress, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. It Happened One Night and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest were the only films to have managed it before. \nJodie Foster brought a fascinating mix of strength, intelligence and vulnerability to the role of prodigious FBI trainee Clarice Starling, forming one of cinema's finest odd couple relationships with Anthony Hopkins's Hannibal Lecter. Hopkins, at the peak of his powers, brought just enough pantomime camp and grandeur, as well as fantastic physicality to the role. \nIt's also one of the most quotable movies ever made, which holds up spectacularly well nearly 30 years on. It's also easy to forget how much the film defied Oscars convention at the time. The Academy has long been reluctant to recognise horror in the Best Picture category - movies as visceral and as violent as The Silence of the Lambs often fail to win recognition at the Awards, which makes its success all the more remarkable.\n                     12 Years A Slave (2014)                   \nSteve McQueen received the Oscars recognition he deserved in 2013, following his powerful films Hunger and Shame a few years earlier. 12 Years A Slave rightly won Best Picture at the Academy Awards in 2014, which marked one of the strongest years for the category in recent times - Dallas Buyers Club, American Hustle, Nebraska, Captain Phillips, Gravity, Her, Philomena and The Wolf of Wall Street were also nominated.\nThe film tells the story of Solomon Northup, a free man subject to unimaginable horrors after being separated from his family and sold into slavery. The movie is staggering in scale and ambition, and features one of the most impressive ensemble casts of the decade so far. There are fantastic performances from the likes of Lupita Nyong'o, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sarah Paulson and Brad Pitt, as well as the beautiful, stoic performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor in the lead role. The Academy also recognised the tyrannical performance from McQueen's long-term collaborator Michael Fassbender as slave owner Edwin Epps with a Best Supporting Actor nomination.\n                     Moonlight (2017)                   \nBarry Jenkins announced himself as a leading filmmaker of his generation with Moonlight - the stunning, semi-autobiographical tale of a young black man growing up on the poverty-stricken streets of Miami, discovering his identity and sexuality in the most testing of circumstances. The beautiful coming-of-age tale is told in three distinct time periods, starring three different actors in the main protagonist role. The effect is astonishing - few films have ever tackled the subjects of masculinity and sexuality so eloquently.\nThe film will, inevitably, be associated with the infamous La La Land/Oscars envelope debacle at the 2017 ceremony, but this timeless piece of filmmaking should be remembered as one of the most awe inspiring movies of the 21st century.\n                     Parasite (2020)                   \nThe win of Moonlight looked, for a moment, to be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it proved the Oscars could be progressive and inclusive. On the other, the win offered the Academy an easy rebuttal to criticisms over a lack of representation. Parasite's win feels weightier. It stands as the first-ever foreign language film to win Best Film - though it picked up International Feature film too, grasping the double win that eluded Roma in 2019 - and it's an utterly deserved win: this is the Academy doing more than trying to swat away the critics.\nSouth Korean master Bong Joon-ho, known for his work on Okja and Snowpiercer, has created one of the most remarkable pieces of filmmaking of recent times, which has transcended genre and language to win rave reviews everywhere. Set in Seoul, it follows two opposing families, one rich and one poor; to watch their relationship unravels is a remarkable thing. A visceral powerhouse, the way the narrative is constructed is uniquely insidious, gripping and moving, while performances across the board are flawless, making this surely one of the best ensemble pieces of recent times. It is a bold and thrilling watch and, as the Standard's David Sexton wrote in his five-star review: \"it freely overrides any genre categorisation, now seeming social realism, now almost Brian Rix-style farce, then thriller, then horror or fantasy, without ever being confined by any of them.\" \n\"Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,\" Bong had said, ahead of the Oscars. This incredible piece of filmmaking is testament to that - the director may have just single handedly opened up film fans to incredible experiences from all over the world. That, alone, is worth celebrating."}, {"text": "Fall releases \"Joker\" and \"Parasite\" at first don't seem easy to compare, but a closer examination of their blood-soaked scenes reveals a shared theme beyond deadly violence.\nThe pairing of \"Joker\" and \"Parasite\" seems appropriate when one considers the social commentary woven within the drama of a well-known struggle: low-income survival. The protagonists in each film are living an austere existence, devoid of both physical and emotional security. The films divide themselves in tone and setting; \"Joker\" is set primarily on the garbage-filled streets of a gritty 1970s-era Gotham City, and \"Parasite\" is split between a modern posh upper-class Korean house and a basement apartment.\nCritics have lauded Todd Phillips' \"Joker,\" based on the DC Comics character, but the film has been mired in controversy over its handling of violence. After its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, many critics praised the story but felt the film irresponsibly portrayed the evolution of its central character from an innocent \"nice guy\" to a perpetrator of violence. The Joker, a famous Batman villain, has a history of compelling and controversial portrayals, most notably Heath Ledger's in 2008?s \"The Dark Knight.\"\nJoaquin Phoenix expertly plays Arthur Fleck, a man dealing with his mental illness, unemployment, the care of his elderly mother and the scorn of a man who might actually be his father: Thomas Wayne, playing a Trump-like businessman running for mayor - not to mention he's also the father of Bruce Wayne. But when Arthur becomes the Joker, he isn't simply a \"nice guy\" who lashes out at everyone who he thinks has wronged him.\nHe is an apolitical agent of chaos like his previous incarnations; he doesn't even seem to recognize the social ramifications of his actions as they course through Gotham City. His final assassination of a late night TV host seems motivated more by the potential fame than the desire to incite violent societal resistance. \"Joker\" is a cautionary tale; in a world where people who need help don't get it, they will demand it with blood.\n[Related: Movie review: 'Joker' successfully invites audience into its descent into madness]\nThe violence of \"Parasite,\" by contrast, is all sharp edges. Its violence is both physically and emotionally cutting; knives are used in favor of guns, which you won't see at all in this Korean drama. Director Bong Joon-ho, known best in North America for his sci-fi drama \"Snowpiercer,\" weaves a tale of sociological duplicity that, for most of the film's run, remains bloodless. The physical violence of \"Parasite\" is only matched by the emotional upheaval it evokes from the characters.\nBoth films boil down to a similar argument: Wealthy people have too much, and the rest of society suffers because of it.\nThe central character of \"Parasite\" is Ki-woo, a young man who helps his poor Korean family pull the ultimate con on the wealthy Park family by strategically hiring each of his family members to serve the socialites under pseudonyms. Their hoax becomes far from harmless, however, when the Parks' former housekeeper reveals she is sheltering her husband, Geun-se, in the Parks' concealed basement.\nWhen Geun-se escapes the basement and stabs Ki-woo's sister in the middle of an extravagant birthday party, the ensuing violence is just as chaotic as that in \"Joker,\" albeit on a smaller scale. The undercurrent of class conflict percolates when Ki-woo's father, Ki-taek, plunges a knife into the heart of his employer, recognizing that the real enemy was a wealthy man who saw his servants as less than human.\n[Related: Second Take: 'Supernatural' leaves its mark on TV culture, coming to an end after 15 years]\nSo why is the violence of \"Joker\" so much more controversial than that of \"Parasite\"? Both films offer biting commentary on wealth inequality and its effect on the lower class. But one story is set in an American city some 40 years ago while the other is contemporary and set in a city most American audiences may not be familiar with.\nPerhaps it's the fact that treatment of people of color in \"Joker\" was ill-reflective: Every interaction Arthur has with a person of color ends with him feeling dejected in some way. Or maybe it's the fact the Joker uses a gun given to him by his co-worker no more than 10 minutes into the film. This access to a deadly weapon seems reflective of the ease of gun ownership in America and plays more like a critical viewpoint than an endorsement of gun violence.\nOr maybe it's because \"Parasite\" does a better job of illustrating the wealth problem as it exists in the world today. Every character in the film is empathetically three-dimensional; even the members of the upper class can respect the professionalism of Ki-taek along with the love Ki-woo's mother is capable of. Arthur, by contrast, is self-centered and focused on his own self-actualization. His view of others depends entirely on how they treat him, not the objective content of their characters.\n\"Parasite\" doesn't punish the wealthy because they're rich. It punishes everyone because every character is at fault for one problem or another. No blood is shed in \"Parasite\" until the desperation to survive becomes overwhelming, unlike \"Joker\" where the violence feels like an afterthought. And looking at endings, the Joker got the easier end of the bargain too.\nHe's locked up in Arkham Asylum giving the staff a hard time, while Ki-woo continues the struggle of his father before him: the never-ending journey of trying to become rich when you can't seem to escape poverty."}, {"text": "Link to Image\nIt's not easy to identify the protagonist of \"Parasite,\" an intricately layered, darkly comic class-war thriller from Korean director Bong Joon-ho, who is best known in the English-speaking world for the apocalyptic action hit \"Snowpiercer.\" Where your compassion and sympathy fall in this tale of two interlocking families at opposite ends of South Korea's societal pyramid will at least partly be a function of your starting point. Furthermore, it's likely to move around over the course of a deliberately perplexing movie loaded with plot switchbacks, sudden reversals of fortune, moral quandaries, and unexpected revelations. \nIn the age of Netflix serials and billion-dollar superhero spectacles, the high-middlebrow cultural zone formerly known as \"world cinema\" exists mostly as an echo of itself. But there's nothing ghostly about Bong's films, which are vibrant genre mashups, loaded with ideas and lustrously crafted, blending elements from Hitchcock, Tarantino, European art film, and the melodramatic and/or violent traditions of Korean cinema, which remains largely unknown in the West. \n\"Parasite\" won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year - which usually means the kiss of death at the American box office - and has already been proclaimed Bong's masterpiece. We'll see about that; no cultural work can be evaluated with that kind of precision right away. (Anyway, I watched \"Snowpiercer\" again recently: Damn!) At any rate, this is a brilliant and troubling film, sometimes hard as ice and sometimes emotionally wrenching, which could only have been made in this moment yet reaches for timeless allegory.\nOne plausible protagonist in \"Parasite,\" at least for a while, is Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-sik), a college-age young man who isn't in college and derisively describes himself as a \"loser\" in an early conversation with a more affluent friend. Ki-woo seizes a lifeline offered by this friend, who's going off to study in America and suggests that Ki-woo take his job as English tutor for a rich girl. All he needs to do is pretend to be something he's not - in this case, middle-class and educated - and the rest will take care of itself.\nKi-woo is also fond of identifying events in the real world as \"metaphorical,\" with the studied blankness of a young person raised on social media to be both sharply observant and entirely ruthless. When I first saw \"Parasite,\" I thought that running joke was a bit too obvious, but the more I thought about it the more I saw the metaphorical use of \"metaphorical\" as part of Bong's ingenious design.\nOn one hand, what happens to the Kim family - who are so poor they literally live underground, in a rancid-smelling, insect-infested apartment just below street level - has the quality of a fairy tale. Ki-woo's magical friend not only gives him a job, and a point of entry into an otherwise inaccessible world of wealth and privilege, but also a traditional stone carving that is supposed to bring prosperity. But on the other hand, all these things are metaphors: The underground apartment, the stinkbugs, the disappearing American friend, the rich princess locked up in a castle, and the stone carving, which brings nothing good to anyone but eventually works its way into the plot, in gruesome and ironic fashion.\nYes, I said there was a princess in a castle. Ki-woo's English-tutor act brings him into the architect-designed hilltop home of the fabulously wealthy Park family, whose teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso), is smitten with him immediately. (It's probably no accident that Kim and Park are extremely common Korean surnames; this is roughly like having two Anglophone families called Smith and Johnson.) Da-hye's mother, Yeon-kyo (hilariously portrayed by Jo Yeo-jeong) is herself a castle-princess of the grown-up variety, anesthetized by pharmaceuticals or mental illness or boredom or just too damn much money. \nThere are many things in \"Parasite,\" including the perplexing character of Yeon-kyo, that some viewers may wish were better explained. For my money, Bong has a wonderful instinct for just riding over certain obvious plot points, either because he thinks they're not important or he'd just rather let us decide. \nSome reviews have implied, for instance, that the Kim family concocts a deliberate scheme to invade and conquer the Park household, once Ki-woo is through the door. But in fact that's not true - or at least, if such a family plot is hatched, we don't witness it. It just seems to happen that way, like a small-scale parody of the old-fashioned Marxist-Leninist narrative of history: The internal logic of capitalism inevitably leads to class conflict and then revolution and then the dictatorship of the proletariat. Human agency is pretty much irrelevant. \nIn the next stage, Ki-woo's teenage sister, the delightfully amoral Ki-jung (Park So-dam) effectively takes over the story, installing herself as \"Jessica,\" the demanding, eccentric art tutor to Da-hye's little brother. Then those two use various dirty tricks to drive away the Park family's chauffeur and, more importantly, the long-serving, long-suffering housekeeper (Lee Jeong-eun) who predates the Parks' arrival and knows more about the house than anyone. (I'm not issuing any spoilers here - but if you have ever seen a thriller featuring an all-knowing housekeeper and suspect she might be important in the third act, you would be correct.)\nIn those roles, under false pretenses, are inserted the cheerful but defeated patriarch of the Kim clan, Ki-taek (terrific Korean character actor Song Kang-ho, seen in several other Bong films), and his dynamo wife Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang), who may be the working-class Lady Macbeth behind this entire scheme. I say may be - as noted above, Bong isn't interested in laying out the whys and hows in granular detail. It's all so metaphorical!\nAs the title of the film suggests, the Kims almost seem to be obeying the dictates of natural selection: The host organism reveals a weak spot that permits infection; the parasite takes advantage and invades. The Kims feel no malice toward the Parks, at least not at first; a parasite is ruthless and completely self-interested, but not intentionally cruel. After all, if it destroys its host ... well, you know the rest.\nBut there is an unasked and unanswered question hanging over this film from the beginning, which drives it through various plot twists toward a violent climax: Who or what is the real parasite in this ecosystem? We never find out why Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), husband and father of the Park family, is so rich, and it seems that the Kims neither know nor care. For everyone in \"Parasite,\" the level of inequality that leads one family to live in a walled-off modernist fantasyland, while far below them another family lives in a basement that literally floods with shit (those metaphors again!), is simply the natural order of things. \nIn fact, it's less accurate to call the invading Kim family \"parasites\" then to call them something even less flattering: They are more like mice or roaches, trying to chew off a bit of the Park household's excess cheese without being noticed. But this is where Bong (who co-wrote the screenplay with Jin Won Han) reaches back from metaphor to reality: Ultimately these are not vermin or hostile organisms but human beings, trapped with other human beings in an ecology that rewards mutual cruelty.\nYou will leave \"Parasite\" with most of the plot puzzles resolved, but certainly not all. (I have a clear opinion about the source of the smell Dong-ik complains about, but I still don't understand the recurring drunken lout or the significance of the Taiwanese cake shop.) Bong and his two families arrive at an ending that may offer a tiny, distant window of Dostoevsky-style hope, or may be nothing more than fantasy. It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the non-metaphorical world, the destination is uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way. \n\"Parasite\" is currently in theaters in New York & Los Angeles, and in select cities coming soon."}, {"text": "It's always odd watching an older movie from a well-known director. Sometimes the early film doesn't measure up to whatever new work brought them recognition.\nNot so with Memories of Murder. The 2003 film was just the second feature from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, and the first collaboration between him and actor Kang-ho Song. Sixteen years later, their fourth film together would win four Academy Awards including best picture. That was Parasite.\nBut Memories of Murder, with its razor-sharp editing and tightly wound plot, already shows the hallmarks of a capable, confident filmmaker. The first scene opens in the autumn of 1986 on what looks to be an idyllic farmer's field, with children scampering about. But something is amiss. Detective Park (Kang) arrives to investigate a body that has been stashed in a drainage ditch.\nHe and Detective Cho (Roe-ha Kim) put their heads together on this and a second murder, and decide a local, intellectually disabled young man is their prime suspect. When a crucial piece of evidence is accidentally destroyed, they simply re-create it as they see fit.\nEnter Detective Seo (Sangkyung Kim), sent from Seoul to help crack the case. He confidently announces they're investigating not two murders but three, and points to a recently vanished woman as fitting the same profile as the other victims. Sure enough, her body is found, but the police are no closer to solving the case.\nBong is working from an actual string of murders in his country in the 1980s, and from a play that dramatized them. The timeframe is vital to the story. A further killing takes place during an air-raid drill, still common today but even more so then. Another happens when all the local police are busy putting down a student demonstration. And when the detectives decide to try DNA analysis, they have to send samples to the U.S. since the technology doesn't yet exist in Korea.\nAdding to the drama is the mistrust felt by Park and Cho - a real good cop/bad cop team, with Cho's preferred method of interrogation a flying kick to the upper body - toward their urban colleague. Maybe it's the fact that Seo is a vegetarian. Maybe it's that he went to university for four years, while Park only did two, and Cho had four straight years but all of them in Grade 9.\nSuffice to say their methods differ drastically - though as time passes, victims pile up and one suspect after another fails to pan out, even Seo starts to lash out in frustration. The actors are truly believable in their roles, as are the minor characters of the hard-drinking chief, and the mostly ignored female officer Kwon, whose habit of listening to the radio in the evenings may yet provide the break they need.\nYou can look up the true story behind Memories of Murder, which briefly resurfaced in the news last year, but you're better off going into this dramatization with as little information as possible. The less you know, the more powerful will be the film's final scene, a haunting conclusion to an excellent movie, and a promise (already delivered!) of more to come. cknight@postmedia.com !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Sun Media Corporation.

Min-hyuk briefly profiles the family, urging his friend to give the job a shot as it could also be his ticket out of the ghetto should he charm Da-hye and marry her once she gets into university.\nThe movie unfolds as the entire Kim family executes a plan to get jobs within the Park family home as they try to scale up the social and economic ladder.\nThe most gripping parallels drawn throughout the film involve the abject poverty of the Kims versus the nearly-obscene wealth of the Parks, which makes for an interesting game of the haves and the have nots.\nThe best strategy (probably character) award without a doubt goes to Ki-woo's sister, Ki-Jung. Thank me later.\nDARK COMEDY THRILLER\nParasitedescribes itself as a dark comedy thriller, and it uses these tools to provide sharp social commentary on class disparity in South Korea, perhaps the entire world.\nEvery scene and prop in the film takes on a life of its own to achieve this, whether it's a peach or a sachet of chilli sauce.\nIt prompts the classed viewer to take a look at themselves, too; listening to otherwise trivial comments like how grateful the rich are for the rain through the ears of the poor, who dread the rain for how much more difficult life becomes when it falls.\nBong Joon-ho uses his films to highlight societal ills often, and Parasite is no different.\nThe masterful way he inspires the audience to empathise with the underdogs and how they choose to chase this opportunity at a better life is quite commendable; he manages to create tension in otherwise funny situations and leaves the audience yearning for a great outcome for this family, while drawing resentment for the Parks, who are the typical family they all aspire to be.\nAll without arousing pity or other dissenting emotions that dehumanise the Kim family.\nIt also ventures out of the box when it comes to the luxuries that the filthy rich can afford.\nWhile other films and stories might focus on material wealth, Bong uses the luxury of time and planning ahead to show how even the aspirations that society views as basic are not a guarantee when you're not sure what tomorrow holds.\nIRONY OF THE FILM\nThe irony of the film lies in how American and other native English-speaking viewers preferred a dubbed version of it as opposed to the one with subtitles.\nIn his acceptance speech at the Oscars, Bong commented on this, saying: \"Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\"\nIf you're not one to enjoy films with subtitles, you'll probably miss out on this worthwhile watch. With that, Parasite is a brilliantly executed movie and by all means worthy of its Best Picture Oscar."}, {"text": "Link to Story\nSEOUL, Dec 17 (NNN-YONHAP) \u2014 Bong Joon-ho's black comedy \"Parasite\" was shortlisted for best international feature film at the upcoming Academy Awards, U.S. media reported Tuesday, raising hopes that it might become the first South Korean film to win an Oscar.According to the Hollywood Reporter and other entertainment news media, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) revealed the list of 10 contenders for the category, previously called the best foreign language film, out of 91 films.The nine other films on the shortlist were \"The Painted Bird\" by Vaclav Marhoul from Czech Republic, \"Truth and Justice\" by Tanel Toom from Estonia, \"Les Miserables\" by Ladj Ly from France, \"Those Who Remained\" by Barnabas Toth from Hungary, \"Honeyland\" co-directed by Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov from North Macedonia, \"Corpus Christi\" by Jan Komasa from Poland, \"Beanpole\" by Kantemir Balagov from Russia, \"Atlantics\" Mati Diop from Senegal and \"Pain and Glory\" by Pedro Almodovar from Spain.For the non-English-language movie category, a country submits a single film as their official representative, and the movies vie for five nominations. \"Parasite\" was selected as South Korea's entry to the best international feature film category in August.\"Parasite\" was also included in the 15-film shortlist of the original song category. \n\"A Glass of Soju,\" lyrics by Bong Joon-ho, will vie for the final nominations with \"Speechless\" from \"Aladdin,\" \"Into The Unknown\" from \"Frozen II\" and \"Spirit\" from \"The Lion King.\"The final five nominees of each section will be announced on January 13 along with the full nominations for the other categories, and the ceremony is scheduled for February 9 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles.

But Lee's mystery drama failed to be included in the final of the 91st Oscars.For the 92nd Academy Awards, however, \"Parasite\" is widely considered to be the strongest challenger for best international feature film on a stack of trophies that the movie has collected since May, when it won Cannes' highest prize, the Palme d'Or.It captured three trophies, including best film, from the L.A.

Solidarity!\" Hoffa is, of course, talking about the idea of solidarity within a union; of brothers in arms, standing up to their powerful employers. In Parasite, no one screams it out, but it is there, the creeping feeling that the only antidote to the sickening reality displayed in the movie is mass class solidarity. How can some live in palatial opulence when so many live in abject poverty? How can it be that so many live in semi-basements while others live in veritable castles?\nThese questions are the driving force behind director Bong Joon-ho's newest film, though it's not so new anymore. The South Korean thriller went wide in October in the United States and Canada. So, why exactly am I reviewing it now, almost four months after its release? It just so happens that the Oscars are approaching on February 10, and Parasite was nominated for best picture, becoming the first Korean film to receive that honour.\nThis review is a plea to the Academy: Parasite is the best picture in a year of fantastic movies. And I really want it to win. I know I shouldn't care about the Oscars-it's an awards show where old white men decide what was best in the year of film, and they're often laughably wrong (Crash over anything else, Driving Miss Daisy over Do the Right Thing, Shakespeare in Love winning due to a rapist's schmoozing, and too many more to mention). Even so, it'd be amazing for a South Korean film with English subtitles to win best picture.\nBong Joon-ho himself said it best in a Vulture article when asked about his movie being the first Korean film to be nominated for best picture: \"It's a little strange, but it's not a big deal. The Oscars are not an international film festival. They're very local.\" He's right, but a man can hope.\nParasite begins by depicting the life of the impoverished Kim family, consisting of the father Ki-taek, mother Chung-sook, daughter Ki-jeong, and son Ki-woo. The film is darkly comedic throughout, but it is especially so at the start; we see Ki-woo on the hunt for a Wi-Fi connection to steal, straining the phone upwards in every corner of the tiny semi-basement dwelling. We see the family folding pizza boxes by the hundreds to make a small amount of money, and Ki-taek stopping his son from closing the window when some sort of pesticide is being sprayed in the street. Free extermination, he says, as the spray seeps into the semi-basement and the family coughs through it and continues to fold.\nThe true power of Parasite lies in its use of juxtaposition, that greatest of film techniques. Think of Michael Corleone at the baptism of his godson intercut with the heads of the five families and Moe Greene being assassinated on his orders. In Parasite we see the splendor and ease with which the unimaginably wealthy go about their day, intercut with Ki-jeong sitting on top of a toilet seat jettisoning water as their semi-basement floods and they, and innumerable other families, are forced out onto the streets. It is a deft use of craft to sucker punch you with the polar opposite worlds our two main families inhabit.\nThe film is further elevated by the superb acting throughout, from the Kim family to the wealthy Park family, who we later meet when Ki-woo begins to tutor their daughter on the recommendation of a friend. Speaking again of the Oscars, it's hard not to call it nakedly racist that none of the incredible performances by Asian actors in the film were recognized.\nAn especially noteworthy performance was given by Song Kang-ho in the role of the father Ki-taek. Throughout the film, we see that Ki-taek is unable to provide for his family as the patriarch, and it is his son's actions that set the integration of the Kim and Park families into motion. Once things start to spiral out of control, Ki-taek plays beautifully his character's descent into what is best described as a serene sort of madness; he listens and internalizes the Park family's remarks on how he smells; he lays on a gym floor with his children after their semi-basement has been flooded; brooding, empty. It is there that his son asks him what the plan he had was to get them out of this situation. It was nothing, he replies. \"With no plan, nothing can go wrong.\"\nThis is a man who has internalized an unimaginable weight; that of his failure as a father. And even in the end, he still almost throws the car keys to the Park family's father, in what would have been a craven act of submission. Ki-taek has been reduced to a shell of a man. And then, finally, he explodes.\nThe ending is also incredible. Showing this young man fantasizing about what he has to do to ever see his father again shows how hopelessly he is trapped within the capitalist system that has left his family and millions of other families in ruins. He is forced to play the game, and that's the whole point-the game is fixed from the start. It's so incredibly depressing, while perhaps at first glance being hopeful and optimistic, and that's what makes it so powerful. Joon-ho ostensibly gives you that sense of hope, and then it hits you like a truck as you walk out of the theatre. You believed in the very thing the movie's entire thematic concept has shown to be a horrifying problem. It's the mark of great art that a slight twist of the head can turn the same scene from restorative to dystopic.\nPerhaps the best thing about the masterpiece that is Parasite is how timely it is. Tension between rich and poor has existed since the dawn of civilization and many (Marx, Steinbeck, Mike Gold, Walter Greenwood, etc) have written extensively on the idea of the working vs. upper class and of a working class revolution. Yet, it feels fresher than ever. It's even worse around the world, as we see depicted in the film, but we North Americans are also witnessing the rapid disappearance of the middle class-more so in the States. But we as Canadians are ever so concerned and ever so attached to our southern neighbours. It's the exact issue that the elite and powerful don't want people talking about because they also understand the history; they know that revolutions occur when people feel they have nothing to lose. And with the growing divide that exists in our world, maybe the micro plot that plays out in Parasite is more prescient than we may believe."}, {"text": "The upcoming semi-holiday Columbus Day weekend will see three new competitors, none of which are likely to present a serious challenge to the second stanza of \"Joker.\" Ang Lee's \"Gemini Man\" with Will Smith and the animated \"      \u00a0    The Addams Family\" are headed for healthy starts, with cellphone-addiction comedy \"Jexi\" far behind.\nMore significant this weekend is the platform launch of \"Parasite\": Not only is it launching a serious awards run, it's also the rare foreign film with breakout potential.\n\"Joker\" Will Set Another Record\nThe controversial movie grossed $96 million over the weekend, even better than initial estimates of $93.5 million. Monday and Tuesday added another $23.6 million, but this weekend will tell us much more about its appeal: 50% down would give it $48 million, putting this around $185 million in 10 days. That's unprecedented for October.\nOne Week, Three Original\u00a0 Releases\nWhile June and July saw a total of just four wide-release original films, we've seen 10 in the last five weeks. \"Hustlers,\" and possibly \"Downton Abbey,\" could reach $100 million, and at least five others will pass $50 million. As with the recent \"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\" and \"Good Boys,\" there has been a healthy return for originals to supplement the franchises. A few weeks ago, \"Downton,\" along with \"Ad Astra\" and \"Rambo: Last Blood,\" all opened over $19 million - very rare. This weekend, two originals should top $20 million.\nDon't Underestimate \"Gemini Man\" or \"The Addams Family\"\nAng Lee's \"Gemini Man\" is the director's latest effort to experiment with higher frame rates, but the real hook is having Will Smith play both a veteran assassin and the 21-year old clone who's pursuing himself. Although Lee has dipped into studio commercial efforts before (\"The Hulk\"), this is at an extreme end. And while Lee won the Best Director Oscar for \"Brokeback Mountain\" and for \"The Life of Pi,\" his \"Gemini Man\" reviews have been terrible. It stands at 36 on Metacritic, and faces the daunting task of recouping a reported cost of over $130 million - about double that of \"Joker.\"\n\"Gemini Man\" it should see $25 million or more for the three-day weekend, and could wind up in third place, behind the animated \"The Addams Family Movie.\" Timing its release with a school holiday and Halloween makes sense. All three \"Hotel Transylvania\" films opened to over $40 million; don't be surprised if this edges \"Gemini.\"\nA Sad Farewell to CBS Films\nCBS Films will go out with a whimper: \"Jexi\" stars Adam DeVine in a comedy about a young man obsessed with his phone. It will likely take in less than $5 million. Directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (\"Bad Moms\"), it's expected to be the distributor's last theatrical feature as corporate owner CBS transitions to streaming.\nCBS Films had a lot going for it. It mostly made original films including \"Last Vegas,\" \"Woman in Black,\" and recently \"Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,\" as well as specialized releases \"Inside Llewellyn Davis\" and \"At Eternity's End.\"\n\"Parasite\" Enters the Bloodstream With a Bong\nOne week after very encouraging initial results for \"Pain and Glory\" ($152,000 in four theaters, high end of late for subtitled releases), Bong Joon Ho's highly anticipated \"Parasite\" should easily exceed that; the question is by how much. It could be staggering; it's opening in New York and Los Angeles, in three theaters, and anything much over $80,000 would set a record for a two-city specialized subtitled release.\nAfter winning the Palme D'Or at Cannes, followed by screenings at the Telluride, Toronto, and New York film festivals, it already has multiple sold-out shows at its three locations (IFC Center in Manhattan, Arclight Hollywood and The Landmark in Los Angeles), many of which include Bong Q&As.\nBong gained wider visibility with his English-language \"Snowpiercer\" and \"Okja.\" This film is set in Korea and taps into the zeitgeist with its story about an impoverished family scamming a wealthy one. It feels more like something Jordan Peele might do than the foreign-language films that typically attract older audiences.\nNeon has built a reputation along the lines of A24 in finding edgy titles that expand the specialized audience. Its top release was \"I, Tonya,\" at $30 million; can Neon find similar success here? Too soon to project; we'll get into that, along with the rosy prospects for \"Pain and Glory,\" next week. But this could be the headline coming out of the weekend.\nNetflix debuts \"The King\" and \"El Camino\"\nSuccess for \"Parasite\" and \"Pain and Glory\" would be particularly gratifying as this week sees multiple titles with concurrent or near-term home viewing. Netflix opens \"El Camino: Breaking Bad\" in more than 125 across the country this weekend, mostly for evening shows - although audiences also have the option of watching it at home. It is the widest Netflix play since \"Roma\" last year. Still lacking any showings by top national chains, of note is, unlike \"Roma\", Arclight and the Arizona-based Harkins will screen \"El Camino.\" This could portend openings for \"The Irishman\" as it struggles to get placement in even 400-500 theaters.\nNetflix also has \"The King\" with Timothee Chalamet and Robert Pattinson in David Michod's historical drama. Its limited release includes Landmark locations in New York and Los Angeles, ahead of its November 1 streaming debut."}, {"text": "[img hash=\"ad8ab1864049e8b2385b75c8d715e277\" width=\"\" height=\"\" align=\"center\" render=\"w620\" caption=\"Japchae from Taste of Korea in Oklahoma City. &#91;Dave Cathey/The Oklahoman&#93;\" ]22[/img]Ram-don, that was my takeaway from this year's Oscar darling \"Parasite.\"After swinging and missing at attempts to screen the picture back in October, I made it out last week after the snow.

The soft tofu plays like a mild, heart-smart crema and the seafood is magic. Japchae might be more familiar. It's a stir-fry of beef, sweet potato starch noodles and vegetables.\u00a0About midway through the meal, I wondered aloud if we were generating some good mojo for \"Parasite\" at the Academy Awards later that evening.

My view of film has become increasingly jaded. I hated it but understood when \"Birdman,\" drew more votes from Academy members than \"Boyhood\" back in 2015. Of course the Academy related better to a deep-dive into the heart of darkness that is an actor's ego over a simple story about a kid growing up between suburban and rural Texas.\u00a0But \"Green Book\"??? How can you not wonder if film has simply devolved into a moderate-risk vehicle for carefully curated and marketed commercial ventures when a film as abjectly average as \"Green Book\" is even nominated as one of the best handful of films in a year, much less win the award?This year didn't look terribly promising unless you were Quentin Tarantino, who had to think he was the prohibitive favorite on the strength of \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" when all it had to face was the inexplicably nominated \"Joker,\" two films from Netflix and the novel but dull \"1917.\" I adored Greta Gerwig's \"Little Women,\" but found it laughable that the best part of the film (Gerwig's directorial spin on the oft-told tale) didn't get nominated.I kept hearing about how great \"Parasite\" was but couldn't imagine a foreign horror movie would win Best Picture.[img hash=\"7cc171410f13557df28e2fc6c691a478\" width=\"\" height=\"\" align=\"center\" render=\"w620\" caption=\"Cho Yeo-jeong in \"Parasite.\"\" ]22[/img]Then I saw the film.

To reap the satisfaction of the resolution on schedule and on time. Maybe even ahead.

By today's standards, it's a near miracle; at another time, it would have been just another job well done. Here's some perspective on its achievement:\n\"Parasite\" Defied 21st-Century Odds\nThe last major foreign-language hit was the French comedy \"Intouchables,\" at $10.2 million. Since \"Amour\" in 2012 ($6.7 million), only Wong Kar Wai's \"The Grandmaster\" has even grossed $5 million (unless Netflix's unreported \"Roma\" managed that; it likely came close). Recent successes like \"Pain and Glory\" ($4 million to date) \"Cold War\" ($4.6 million) \"Shoplifters\" ($3.3 million) all fell short.\n\"Parasite\" Won't Break Records\nDefinition first: The biggest non-English domestic release - by far - is \"The Passion of the Christ\" (like all upcoming numbers, adjusted to 2020 prices) at $533 million. Other art-house titles that grossed over $100 million include \"La Dolce Vita,\" \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" \"Z,\" \"Life Is Beautiful,\" and \"I Am Curious (Yellow).\" Titles to pass $50 million include \"La Cage aux Folles,\" \"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"Amelie,\" \"Il Postino,\" and \"Like Water for Chocolate.\"\nThe \"Parasite\" Advantage\nFirst and foremost: Neon was involved with \"Parasite\" far ahead of its release. When Quinn ran The Weinstein Company's niche label Radius, he worked closely with Bong on his English-language \"Snowpiercer\" (and fought fiercely with Harvey Weinstein over the film's editing and release.) Neon bought North American rights for \"Parasite\" shortly after filming wrapped in October 2018, and that long runway was key: It gave the company time to create marketing, strategize distribution plans, identify press and festival opportunities, and conduct audience research. All of that bears little resemblance to subtitled standouts that are acquired at Cannes and, three months later, must hit the ground running at fall festivals.\nThen, at a Cannes that featured a stellar lineup (\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" \"Pain and Glory,\" \"A Hidden Life,\" \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire,\" \"Les Miserables,\" and more) \"Parasite\" won the top prize. Although Bong was already a well-known and respected filmmaker, that triumph came as a surprise. (It also represented the first time that a Korean director won the Palme d'Or.)\nAs a director, Bong had another North American advantage over most subtitled filmmakers: His work already reached younger audiences. In addition to \"Snowpiercer,\" he directed Netflix title \"Okja\" and 2006 horror film \"The Host,\" which was a modest hit ($3.2 million) and as earned cult affection over the years. Even an established European master like Pedro Almodovar doesn't have the same currency. Bong is more like Alfonso Cuaron, who has shifted seamlessly between studio and art-house fare, which brought credibility for \"Roma\" ahead of most other non-English releases.\nA Brilliant Release Plan, Executed Perfectly\nWhether studio or specialized, distribution professionals face many choices in releasing a film. For studio distributors, dates are the primary consideration; for specialized, that initial date is only the beginning. Neon's considerations also included\u00a0a staggered expansion while also considering the pace that would keep it in public view through two sets of holidays and maximize its awards chances as well as overall revenue.\nAhead of this, Neon had to figure out how to integrate the top festivals. \"Parasite\" played the post-Cannes big three Telluride, Toronto, and New York, which dictated that the earliest it could go was October 11. That's an unusual date for a foreign-language title hoping to sustain a long run. Recent contenders have opened between mid-November and as late as just before New Year's in order to guarantee play during key dates around the height of the awards season. However, that early date proved to be an excellent choice.\nThe film had a staggering opening weekend of $393,000 in three theaters, the best platform debut of 2019. The theaters had far less demand on that October date, allowing far more capacity than most later dates might have permitted. Another very unusual choice followed: Neon delayed opening at its second New York theater in Lincoln Center. That meant that city's audience had only one theater, and a larger overall per-theater average resulted - as well as more rapturous box-office coverage. That giant total caught the attention of all exhibitors, even those who have limited interest in non-English titles, and gained \"Parasite\" major entree.\nBuoyed by uniformly excellent reviews, and then word of mouth, \"Parasite\" is a now in week 14 of its run with a nearly $26 million gross. That included six weeks of initial expansion, up to 620 theaters and $15 million. The eight weeks since, with fewer theaters, have added $11 million.\nThat steadfast performance is almost unheard of, even among top Oscar contenders. Yes, Thanksgiving and Christmas helped once the film sustained enough business to compete during those crowded dates. But the film has ranked between #10-#18 every week since its opening. That further feeds its momentum, especially in Los Angeles and New York. (It was #3 last weekend at the high-end Arclight Hollywood, where it's played since day one.)\nAt $30 million, it would be second only to \"Uncut Gems\" (which had a much wider release) among initially platformed specialized releases from 2019 - higher than \"Jojo Rabbit,\" \"Judy,\" \"The Farewell,\" and \"Booksmart.\" Neon's biggest success to date was \"I, Tonya,\" which grossed $30 million.\nThe Best May Be Yet to Come\nOld-school folks might wonder why \"Parasite\" is starting home availability just as it goes wide. However, the film could end up making more money through these secondary venues than in its theatrical run.\nHistorically, an independent film with a long run and a high gross will likely will see film rentals of 45% or lower from exhibitors. At $30 million, the distributor will receive about $13 million.\nGiven the way Neon released the film, and its Oscar nominations, the reality is there are a lot of potential consumers still out there. Outlets like iTunes, Amazon Prime, and VOD provide a far higher return to a distributor than film rental, particularly in later weeks. Distributors are reported to get 65%-70% on streaming/VOD revenues. Prices vary (the initial premium rate is $14.99), but a more standard $6.99 rental times 3 million purchases might return more to Neon than their theatrical take.\nAll of this goes back to a great hand that Neon played to the hilt. With it comes library value, elevating the company as an even more important go-to distributor, and showing of its finesse to major filmmakers.

Ang Lee's 'Gemini Man[1]' with Will Smith and the animated 'The Addams Family[2]' are headed for healthy starts, with cellphone-addiction comedy 'Jexi' far behind. More significant this weekend is the platform launch of 'Parasite[3]': Not only is it launching a serious awards run, it's also the rare foreign film with breakout potential.'Joker' Will Set Another RecordThe controversial movie grossed $96 million over the weekend, even better than initial estimates of $93.5 million. \nMonday and Tuesday added another $23.6 million, but this weekend will tell us much more about its appeal: 50% down would give it $48 million, putting this around $185 million in 10 days. That's unprecedented for October.One Week, Three Original ReleasesWhile June and July saw a total of just four wide-release original films, we've seen 10 in the last five weeks. 'Hustlers,' and possibly 'Downton Abbey,' could reach $100 million, and at least five others will pass $50 million. As with the recent 'Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark' and 'Good Boys,' there has been a healthy return for originals to supplement the franchises. A few weeks ago, 'Downton,' along with 'Ad Astra' and 'Rambo: Last Blood' all opened over $19 million \u2014 very rare. This weekend, two originals should top $20 million.Don't Underestimate 'Gemini Man' or 'The Addams Family'Ang Lee's 'Gemini Man' is the director's latest effort to experiment with higher frame rates, but the real hook is having Will Smith play both a veteran assassin and the 21-year old clone who's pursuing himself. Although Lee has dipped into studio commercial efforts before ('The Hulk'), this is at an extreme end. And while Lee won the Best Director Oscar for 'Brokeback Mountain' and for 'The Life of Pi,' his 'Gemini Man' reviews have been terrible. It stands at 36 on Metacritic, and faces the daunting task of recouping a reported cost of over $130 million \u2014 about double that of 'Joker.' 'Gemini Man' it should see $25 million or more for the three-day weekend, and could wind up in third place, behind the animated 'The Addams Family Movie.' Timing its release with a school holiday and Halloween makes sense. All three 'Hotel Transylvania' films opened to over $40 million; don't be surprised if this edges 'Gemini.'A Sad Farewell to CBS FilmsCBS Films will go out with a whimper: 'Jexi' stars AdamDeVine in a comedy about a young man obsessed with his phone. It will likely take in less than $5 million. Directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore ('Bad Moms'), it's expected to be the distributor's last theatrical feature as corporate owner CBS transitions to streaming. CBS Films had a lot going for it. It mostly made original films including 'Last Vegas,' 'Woman in Black,' and recently 'Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,' as well as specialized releases 'Inside Llewellyn Davis' and 'At Eternity's End.''Parasite' Enters the Bloodstream With a BongOne week after very encouraging initial results for 'Pain and Glory' ($152,000 in four theaters, high end of late for subtitled releases), Bong Joon-ho's highly anticipated 'Parasite' should easily exceed that; the question is by how much. It could be staggering; it's opening in New York and Los Angeles, in three theaters, and anything much over $80,000 would set a record for a two-city specialized subtitled release. After winning the Palme D'Or at Cannes, followed by screenings at the Telluride, Toronto, and New York film festivals, it already has multiple sold-out shows at its three locations (IFC Center in Manhattan, Arclight Hollywood and The Landmark in Los Angeles), many of which include Bong Q... Bong gained wider visibility with his English-language 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja.' This film is set in Korea and taps into the zeitgeist with its story about an impoverished family scamming a wealthy one. It feels more like something Jordan Peele might do than the foreign-language films that typically attract older audiences. Neon has built a reputation along the lines of A24 in finding edgy titles that expand the specialized audience. Its top release was 'I, Tonya,' at $30 million; can Neon find similar success here? Too soon to project; we'll get into that, along with the rosy prospects for 'Pain and Glory,' next week. But this could be the headline coming out of the weekend.Netflix debuts 'The King' and 'El Camino'Success for 'Parasite' and 'Pain and Glory' would be particularly gratifying as this week sees multiple titles with concurrent or near-term home viewing. Netflix opens 'El Camino: Breaking Bad' in more than 125 across the country this weekend, mostly for evening shows \u2014 although audiences also have the option of watching it at home. It is the widest Netflix play since 'Roma' last year. Still lacking any showings by top national chains, of note is, unlike 'Roma', Arclight and the Arizona-based Harkins will screen 'El Camino.' This could portend openings for 'The Irishman' as it struggles to get placement in even 400-500 theaters. Netflix also has 'The King' with Timothee Chalamet and Robert Pattinson in David Michod's historical drama. Its limited release includes Landmark locations in New York and Los Angeles, ahead of its November 1 streaming debut. Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

With less time than ever before to make a final impression, and some awards campaigners are sticking with their ad strategies while others are tweaking the message to lure voters in the homestretch. You used to be able to see these battles waged on billboards along the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood \u2014 but since Netflix bought many of those signs, that stretch of road plays more like an indicator of the streaming service's priorities than a real Oscars battleground. Granted, Sony has a billboard for #8216;Little Women,#8217; Warner Bros. \nhas one for #8216;Joker#8217; and Disney has used the side of a building that always sports the studio's ads for #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; from Fox, which is now owns \u2014 but those pale next to the eight Netflix billboards for #8216;The Irishman,#8217; five for #8216;Marriage Story#8217; and two for the documentary #8216;American Factory,#8217; along with single billboards for #8216;The Two Popes,#8217; #8216;I Lost My Body#8217; and #8216;Klaus.#8217; Here's our annual look at who's saying what in an attempt to lure voters at the last minute. Also Read: The Oscars Homestretch: '1917' Is on Top as Voting Begins[1]#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;Message: This is your movie, Hollywood. Quentin Tarantino's film about a fading TV star (Leonardo DiCaprio), his loyal stuntman (Brad Pitt) and the folks they encounter in 1969 Tinseltown, including Sharon Tate and the Manson Family, has had the biggest Phase 2 makeover, with a brand new slogan that emblazons all of its For Your Consideration ads: #8216;Because you love movies.#8217; Sony has been using that line in advertisements and also emphasizing it via a video feature subtitled #8216;A love letter to making movies.#8217; The message is aimed squarely at the voters who made Best Picture winners out of #8216;The Artist#8217; and #8216;Argo#8217;: If you want to celebrate Hollywood, this is the movie to do it. Of course, there's a secondary message to those shots of DiCaprio and Pitt effortlessly exuding charm that pops off the page: #8216;Because you love movies and because you love Leo #8216;n' Brad, too.#8217;#8216;The Irishman#8217;Message: Because you love movies by Marty. On the surface, the #8216;Irishman#8217; campaign hasn't changed much since the days when the film drew rave reviews out of the New York Film Festival and was considered a Best Picture front-runner. For the most part, the ads use the same still photos, the same dark, somber look and the same emphasis on the three-and-a-half-hour Martin Scorsese film as a landmark. But the emphasis is more and more strongly centered on Scorsese himself, and on positioning the film as a summation of his past work, particularly in the mob genre. One billboard on a prime stretch of Sunset trumpets a quote from Rolling Stone: #8216;Martin Scorsese \u2014 America's greatest living director \u2014 creates his late-career masterpiece.#8217; And another juxtaposes a photo of Scorsese and star Robert De Niro on the set of the new film with one taken on the set of one of their earliest collaborations from the 1970s. The two photos are separated by a quote from #8216;The Irishman#8217;: #8216;You don't know how fast time goes by until you get there.#8217; In other words: Scorsese is a national treasure, this film is a summation of sorts and the time to honor him is now. In a way, the approach is reminiscent of what The Weinstein Company did with 2002's #8216;Gangs of New York,#8217; promoting it as the career summary for which Scorsese deserved his first Best Director award. (It didn't work then, since #8216;Chicago#8217; won Best Picture and Roman Polanski won Best Director for #8216;The Pianist.#8217;) Also Read: Martin Scorsese's Crime Films Ranked, From 'Boxcar Bertha' to 'The Irishman' (Photos)[2]#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;Message: Peace, baby. Apart from #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,#8217; #8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217; has had the closest thing to a Phase 2 makeover. In many of the ads in the past week, the usual shots from the film, and the usual colorful graphics and lines like #8216;An anti-hate satire,#8217; have been replaced by black-and-white portraits of director Taika Waititi and stars Scarlett Johansson, Roman Griffin Davis and Thomasin McKenzie flashing the peace sign \u2014 while ads that include photos from the film often bear slogans like #8216;Never Too Soon for Peace.#8217; While the peace sign had been a staple of #8216;Jojo#8217; ads from the start, the black-and-white photos and starker look drives the message home in a more serious way and positions the film not so much as a sharp, satire but as the gentler, healing drama \u2014 the movie everybody can rally behind, because who doesn't want peace? Then again, if you're looking for a more complex message, there's also a new #8216;Jojo#8217; ad that quotes no less than early 20th-century Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke (#8216;Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final.#8217;), who has likely never before been cited while talking about the work of Taika Waititi.#8216;Parasite#8217;Message: Don't you want to make history? The campaign for #8216;Parasite#8217; hasn't changed dramatically, except perhaps to get a little bolder as the film has picked up one guild award after another. But on Facebook, it's hard to avoid the film's reposting of all the rave reviews and the think pieces telling the Academy that they have to give Bong Joon Jo's film the Best Picture award. And on quite a few of those, the same line is used in the intro: #8216;If not now, when?#8217; Clearly, Neon knows that #8216;Parasite#8217; is closer to winning the big award than any non-English film has ever been. And they want the Academy to think about that, and to decide that this is the time to break new ground.

Sam Mendes' World War I drama has already picked up many of the key precursor awards on the road to Oscar: the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture #8212; Drama, the Producers Guild and Directors Guild Awards, the BAFTA Award. So increasingly, the message in its ads is a simple one, and one that is aimed at everybody's desire to be on the winning side.#8216;Joker#8217;Message: We are not a comic book movie, dammit. The print ads pretty much look the same, but #8216;Joker#8217; is now drawing its message from something that Joaquin Phoenix said at the Critics' Choice Awards last month about the film's writer and writer-director: #8216;Scott Silver and Todd Phillips, you tricked us. You took a comic-book character and used it to talk about childhood trauma, gun violence, isolation and mental health.#8217; Lines like those are now used to position #8216;Joker#8217; not as the top-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees (by far), but as a serious work about serious issues. That's spelled out in the ads, but most notably in the six different stories in a special 12-page advertorial section in a recent issue of Variety (#8216;Partner Ad Content,#8217; it says on some of the pages). The opening story pretty much lays it on the line, starting with the headline #8216;#8216;Joker' Proves the Power of Empathy#8217; and, in the final paragraph, quoting Mahatma Gandhi: #8216;The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.#8217; (Granted, in this case the vulnerable member of society is one who becomes celebrated when he starts killing people, but still.)

The Best Picture chances of these films have largely faded away, so the ads remain straightforward, touting all the Top 10 lists and critical raves, and often focusing on the categories in which the films have the best chance. #8216;Marriage Story#8217; focuses on Laura Dern for Best Supporting Actress. #8216;Little Women#8217; singles out Greta Gerwig's screenplay. #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; plays up on the scale that could lead to below-the-line awards: #8216;Big screen moviemaking at its finest,#8217; reads a huge ad for the film covering the side of the building on Sunset. OthersThere's a big battle being waged in the Best Animated Feature category, where rivals have perceived weaknesses in the normally dominant Pixar (which has #8216;Toy Story 4#8217;) and Disney (which wasn't even nominated for #8216;Frozen II#8217;). DreamWorks Animation has been aggressively advertising #8216;How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,#8217; Netflix is of course touting #8216;Klaus#8217; and #8216;I Lost My Body#8217; and Laika/Universal have been particularly active with ad buys on behalf of #8216;Missing Link.#8217; At the top of one recent #8216;Missing Link#8217; ad was a list of the other Laika films nominated in the category (#8216;Coraline,#8217; #8216;ParaNorman,#8217; #8216;The Boxtrolls#8217; and #8216;Kubo and the Two Strings#8217;) along with a quote: #8216;#8216;Missing Link' is the fifth Laika film to be nominated and is now the most nominated studio without a win.#8217; That final phrase was in extra-big type. There has also been a last-minute flurry of ads in the documentary feature race (#8216;American Factory#8217; v. #8216;The Cave#8217; v. #8216;The Edge of Democracy#8217; v. #8216;For Sama,#8217; with #8216;Honeyland#8217; taking out fewer ads but getting extra attention because it's also nominated for Best International Feature Film). And in the competition for Best Original Song, ads for #8216;Harriet#8217; all tout its nominated song while the songs from Diane Warren (#8216;Breakthrough#8217;) and from Elton John and Bernie Taupin (#8216;Rocketman#8217;) have also been visible.

Are there upsets looming in a year that has become wildly unpredictable as to which way the Oscar winds may be blowing? We will have a much better idea by the point that the two-week holiday break is officially over. In that time the Palm Springs International Film Festival will have handed out its ginormous trophies, AFI will have had its awards luncheon, and the Golden Globes will be history. Just one day after everyone is officially back at their desks (if they take the whole New Years weekend) those Oscar ballots will be due on January 7th, and it is still a mystery just how many members will actually have caught up on all the films and what kind of turnout the Academy can create with its constant reminders to members.\nOne storied Oscar winning actress told me she was \"blown away\" by Parasite, and has seen The Joker twice just to see Joaquin Phoenix give what she considers to be one of the greatest, and in her words, inspiring performances she has ever witnessed. She still has to catch up however on a number of movies including Marriage Story\u00a0she says she has yet to see even once yet. A former Academy officer and veteran of several dozen movies emailed me to say, \"just saw the best film by far. By far the best film. In every category!\" He was referring to 1917. A Best Actor nominee from last year concurs and also mentioned that movie as the one that has impressed him the most. Another Oscar voter, who touts\u00a0Ford v Ferrari\u00a0as a personal favorite though told me he admires\u00a01917 from a technical POV, but wanted more emotion.It finally opened in limited release on Christmas so now the public gets to weigh in as well, but Universal had those screeners for the Sam Mendes film out there as quickly as they could.\nSurprisingly so did Disney for their box office behemoth, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker,\u00a0even sending to the Producers Guild and others before the film had officially opened on December 20, an unusual move for a blockbuster in danger of being pirated, and one that isn't topping any pundits list of likely Best Picture nominees, but the PGA is known for bucking the trend and occasionally throwing a bone the money makers. This week the Writers Guild got a digital copy in their inboxes. On Christmas Disney even took a full page ad in the LA Times (in between a bunch of Netflix ads) asking for consideration in Best Picture, perhaps sensing, or hoping,\u00a0the Best Picture picture is still a little unsettled. However no\u00a0Star Wars\u00a0movie has achieved that feat since the first one in 1977, but they Disney is praying what is being labeled as the last in the nine film series will buck the trend despite middling reviews.\u00a0Avengers: Endgame\u00a0is in the same yacht, big moneymakers for the Mouse House but longshots for Oscar. Disney's best bets are the aforementioned Ford v Ferrari\u00a0and\u00a0Jojo Rabbit\u00a0which they inherited in the Fox buy.\nAs for Netflix they are not leaving anything to chance, particularly in efforts for The Irishman,\u00a0which would seem to be a safe bet for numerous nominations including Best Picture, but right now is a little shaky in the Best Actor category for title star Robert De Niro who failed to grab SAG or Golden Globe nominations for his performance. I have heard those snubs batted away by explaining SAG is already giving him the Life Achievement Award this year so no need for a Lead Actor nod, and that the HFPA still hasn't gotten over De Niro jokingly suggesting during his Cecil B. DeMille acceptance speech in 2011 that some Globes voters could be \"deported\". The only problem with the latter theory is he was actually Globe-nominated for his TV role in The Wizard Of Lies\u00a0just two years ago. At any rate to further solidify De Niro support the streamer is launching an American Cinematheque series that starts with a 45 minute conversation between De Niro and his long time collaborator       \u00a0    Martin Scorsese followed by an Irishman\u00a0screening at the Egyptian. Then for the remainder of January they will have a matinee retrospective at the Aero Theatre called \"The Films Of Marty And Bob\", featuring all eight of their previous films together beginning with 1973's\u00a0Mean Streets. By the way the Cinematheque is changing a steep $40 for general admission ($30 for members) just to get into the conversation on the 4th, the highest admission price I can ever recall them charging for\u00a0anything.\u00a0\nThe Best Actor race is easily the most competitive, thus the worry that De Niro's terrific but low key portrayal could get lost in the crowd. There are at least ten viable nominees, but only five slots. I can see five worthy actors being left out in the cold with no nomination, when in another year they might have even\u00a0won. Netflix alone could almost fill the category with De Niro, Adam Driver, Jonathan Pryce, and Eddie Murphy who after his acclaimed and highly rated return to host Saturday Night Live\u00a0last weekend has renewed momentum in the race, one that could bring him his first- ever Leading Actor Oscar nomination for Dolemite Is My Name. He was nominated just once previously in the supporting category for\u00a0Dreamgirls in 2006 but lost to Alan Arkin in Little Miss Sunshine. He won his only Golden Globe for that performance, and is a good bet to take a second career Globe win on January 5th in the Lead Actor Comedy or Musical category\u00a0if he can get by another GG favorite, twelve-time nominee and three time winner Leonardo DiCaprio. The Globes are likely to be spread all over the place, but you can bet the farm that DiCaprio's film, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\u00a0takes Best Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and his co-star Brad Pitt wins Best Supporting Actor. And could Netflix's own\u00a0The Two Popes\u00a0upset their\u00a0The Irishman\u00a0in Best Motion Picture -Drama ? The film, which received four nominations, might seem a long shot but talk to any Hollywood Foreign Press member and you will see how much they loved it. It reminds me of last year when they went their own way being an early adopter of\u00a0Green Book\u00a0and\u00a0Bohemian Rhapsody,\u00a0two films they also just\u00a0loved. Don't be surprised if the HFPA gets a little religion this year in what could be a\u00a0shocker.\nCAN ADAM SANDLER GET RESPECT?\nThe other day I was interviewing Adam Sandler at a Q&A in Century City for his latest film, Uncut Gems, and I asked him how it felt to be in a film that is winning him so much acclaim and awards recognition. \"What does it feel? Uh,\u00a0new, \"\u00a0he laughed, but as the New York diamond merchant in the Safdie Brothers indie hit, he has won the National Board Of Review Best Actor prize, several other nominations and critics awards, as well as a nomination for Best Actor at the Critics Choice Awards on January 12. The film has opened exceptionally well at the box office and that could help drive Oscar voter interest in checking it out despite Sandler's omission at the Globes and SAG. Again it is an extremely crowded category to break into but there is already evidence of that happening for the Uncut Gems\u00a0star. Sandler tells the story of getting a personal call from none other than three- time Best Actor winner Daniel Day Lewis who rang him up just to wax rhapsodic on Adam's performance,the kind of high wire acting tour de force other actors love. If enough of them do, then he could squeeze in, and alas squeeze the likes of De Niro or Murphy out.\u00a0This is why Oscar consultants get ulcers.\nWILL 'PARASITE' INVADE THE OSCAR HISTORY BOOKS?\nThe Cannes Film Festival has taken its hits over recent years in being a dangerous place to debut a potential Oscar Best Picture contender, just because May is awfully early to unveil your goods and the chance of getting a negative response is just too great to take. Only films like Spike Lee's BlackKlansman, Paramount's Rocketman, and this year's potential Oscar juggernaut Once Upon A Time In Hollywood seem to be bucking the trend of waiting for the Fall Film Festivals instead, and that is only because all were summer releases making Cannes a natural stop as part of a worldwide publicity campaign. This year just might be different, and it could even make history. There is clearly a Parasite invading the Oscar race and based on numerous conversations I have been having lately, this South Korean worldwide hit just might have the stuff to become the first foreign language film to actually go all the way and win Best Picture. Not only would that be a first in Oscar history, it would also mark only the second time the winner of the Palme d'Or in Cannes matched Oscar's Best Picture champ. The only other example was in 1955, the first year when both prizes existed at the same time and Marty won both. It has never happened since, even if it looked for a minute as if Roman Polanski's Palme d'Or winning The Pianist was about to pull off a Best Pic upset against Chicago in 2002. Can Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece, which opened in North America in October, finally do the trick? We will know in just a few weeks. At any rate the one great consistency of Cannes has been in influencing the eventual nominees for Best Foreign Language Film, now newly renamed Best International Film. This year no less than half of the shortlisted ten finalists to become one of the five eventual nominees first debuted in Cannes, and of course one of them is Parasite.\nIS SACHEEN LITTLEFEATHER COMING BACK TO THE       \u00a0    OSCARS\nFor those who love dabbling in Oscar history like I do, the name Sacheen Littlefeather is indelibly planted in our heads. She of course became infamous as the young Native American woman Marlon Brando sent to the 1973 Academy Awards ceremony to get on stage and refuse his Best Actor Oscar for\u00a0The Godfather.\u00a0Last month she won several honors, including the newly created Brando Award, for a short film about her life at the Red Nation International Film Festival's 24th Annual Awards Ceremony, an event put on by the Red Nation Celebration Institute to shine a light on the kinds of achievements by American Indian and Indigenous voicess that struggle to find attention in the mainstream media. Among others who attended were Hostiles\u00a0director Scott Cooper and his star Christian Bale (they presented to their Native American consultant on the film). Littlefeather's film is a 25 minute short called Sacheen: Breaking The Silence from writer/director Peter Spirer, and in it Littlefeather (birth name: Maria Cruz) provides an on-screen account of her involvement with Brando and how she came to command the attention of the world and the one billion viewers of the Academy Awards by delivering his message about the misrepresentation of Native Americans in Hollywood films. It is a compelling and moving account of her life, but focuses on the part of it that made this actress who had appeared in small roles in movies like Freebie And The Bean and\u00a0The Trial Of Billy Jack an instant household name and answer to one of the great all-time Oscar trivia questions.\nThe Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences gave permission for the footage of the ceremony and the film is a fascinating and detailed account of what happened from the moment she was invited to Brando's for dinner all the way to the reprecussions of her appearance on the Oscar stage, one that led to what she calls her \"redlisting\" in Hollywood films and eventually to a different kind of life in which she worked with Mother Theresa among others. She says she was accused of being a \"Mexican actress\" who wore a costume that night, among other indignities this Native American performer was falsely accused of. In the film she gives exacting detail regarding how it all came down. At dinner at his house Brando made her wait while he wrote an 8 page speech he expected her to read on stage, informing her she was not to touch the Oscar if the presenters (Roger Moore and Liv Ullmann) tried to hand it to her. Show producer Howard W. Koch confronted her beforehand and said she could not read the speech and had only 60 seconds or would be tossed out, so she eventually improvised it, giving Brando's intentions. She talks about being booed by portions of the audience, and how the press treated her backstage. In one great segment, decades later the film chronicles her actual meeting at a book signing with Ullmann who is stunned when she reveals their one-time connection on the Oscars. Littlefeather who says her favorite filmmaker has always been Ingman Bergman was obsessed in knowing what the great Swedish director thought about that night. Ullmann says he loved it.\nThe strange bedfellows Oscar history makes is what makes the show unique unto itself. Oscar and Littlefeather are inextricably tied together, and she is very eloquent in telling how.In the film the 73 year old reveals she has been given a terminal fourth stage cancer diagnosis but chooses to live each day knowing she had done some good with her life, and in the case of the Oscars that was getting the message of treatment of Native Americans out to an audience that never would have heard it otherwise. The same goes for this film which is looking for distribution. Joanelle Romero is founder and CEO of RNCI is a member of AMPAS and is still the only Native American filmmaker to be shortlisted in the Documentary Short Branch for her 2000 film American Holocaust: When It's All Over I'll Still Be Indian.\u00a0She will be showcasing 23 films at the Native Women In Film festival the week of the Oscars on Feb 5 and 6 in Beverly Hills, and Sacheen will be one of them. She is also hoping to get the Red Nation fest to be an Oscar-Qualifying festival where these movies will have a better chance of getting recognition, at least on shortlists, at the Academy Awards. Certainly AMPAS, which has only awarded two Oscars to Native Americans in its history to songwriter Buffy Sainte Marie for Best Song in 1983 and an Honorary Award this year to actor Wes Studi, should be interested considering their much talked-about push for diversity. Who knows? Maybe Sacheen Littlefeather has one more Oscar ceremony in her, this time accepting for\u00a0herself.\nMore from Deadline\nMartin Scorsese's Daughter Trolls Him With Marvel-Themed Christmas Wrapping Paper      \u00a0    Bill Cosby Rep Hits Back At Eddie Murphy Over 'Saturday Night Live' Dig, Calls Him \"Hollywood Slave\"      \u00a0    Eddie Murphy's Return Delivers Big Ratings For 'Saturday Night Live'"}, {"text": "Kang-Ho Song, from left, Jang Hye-jin, Park So-dam, Lee Sun Gyun, and Choi Woo-shik, winners of the award for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture for \"Parasite\" attend the 2020 PEOPLE SAG Awards Afterparty at the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall on Sunday, Jan. 19, 2020, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Colin Young-Wolf/Invision for PEOPLE Magazine/AP Images)\nOver the course of three months, I have heard the same buzz from friends and family regarding Bong Joon-ho's latest release, \"Parasite,\" with most calling it a masterpiece. It wasn't a film I was determined to see, despite being bombarded by constant statements validating its greatness. It wasn't until its Academy Award nomination for Best Picture that I finally felt required to see it.\nJust like every review, article and opinion I've heard, I agree that \"Parasite\" is indeed a good movie. However, it wasn't just the performances of the cast or the cinematography that caused even the most rigid film buffs to cite it as one of their all-time favorite movies. Instead, it was the commentary behind every action of the film that seemed to draw the favorable attention of audiences and create the perfect unity that every decent movie hopes to achieve.\nThere are many different interpretations of the film's title. I interpret it through the actions of the Kim family, acting like parasites by latching onto the wealthy lifestyle of the Park family by acquiring jobs as their daughter's tutor, their son's art therapist, their driver and their housekeeper. It essentially creates an image of the poor eating the rich, providing an interesting commentary on social class.\nThe unusual decision to portray the rich as gullible and helpless was not only a smart method of grabbing the audience's attention but also a plot device that I had not seen before. Seeing how the street smarts of the Kim family eventually help them infiltrate the ever-trusting Parks' home provides a refreshing statement about the assumptions we develop about the lower class. It says that formal education is not everything and most need to struggle to survive.\n\"Parasite\" has acquired numerous accolades, including a Critics' Choice Award for Best Director and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film among many others. Its immense popularity has proven to be a major turning point in cinema, as it brings an open-minded attitude toward film culture.\nA rise in global perspective is an important aspect of cinema that we should all be aware of and become accustomed to. \"Parasite\" is the 11th foreign film ever nominated for Best Picture in Academy history, none of which have won, but many believe it has a fair shot of winning. Milestones like this are a first step towards international film acceptance and recognizing the talents of filmmakers around the globe.\n\"Parasite\" being nominated not only brings opportunity for global perspective, but also a potential solution for lack of diversity. Diversity in Hollywood has been a constant controversial topic that has become noticeably prominent in recent years. The release of Bong's film helps fill that gap and opens doors for other international directors as well as diverse casts featured in other international films.\nLike others who have seen this film, I have not hesitated in recommending this movie to everyone. However, numerous friends of mine simply refuse to watch foreign films because they hate reading subtitles and assume they won't understand it. I guess they'll never know what they're missing."}, {"text": "NEW YORK - Sam Mendes' World War I tale \"1917\" followed up its big night at the Golden Globes with a nomination for best screenplay from the Writers Guild on Monday.\nAlongside \"1917,\" the writers guild nominated for best original screenplay the scripts to \"Booksmart,\" \"Knives Out,\" \"Marriage Story\" and \"Parasite.\"\nIn the adapted screenplay category, the guild selected \"A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\" \"The Irishman,\" \"Jojo Rabbit,\" \"Joker\" and \"Little Women.\"\nA handful of contenders weren't eligible because the Writers Guild only rewards films produced under a WGA contract. Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,\" which won best screenplay Sunday at the Globes, was ineligible. (Tarantino years ago refused to join the guild after a dispute over crediting on Oliver Stone's \"Natural Born Killers.\") Also out of the running were \"The Farewell\" and \"Pain and Glory.\"\nBecause of those exceptions, the WGA Awards don't always predict Oscar nominees. But their choices otherwise largely overlap with eventual Academy Awards nominees.\nThat's good news for nominees like Greta Gerwig's Louisa May Alcott adaptation \"Little Women,\" which has struggled to find traction in awards season despite rave reviews and strong box office. Bong Joon Ho's thriller \"Parasite,\" which also received a best ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild, also continues to look like a rare foreign language Oscar heavyweight.\nThe nomination for \"1917,\" a movie most celebrated as a visual achievement, suggests the film is resonating outside of technical categories. In an upset on Sunday, Mendes' film won best drama and best director at the Globes. It's the first script the British director has written, penned with Krysty Wilson-Cairns.\nWhile a number of front-runners like Noah Baumbach's \"Marriage Story,\" \"The Irishman\" (written by Steven Zaillian) and Taika Waititi's \"Jojo Rabbit\" were predictably selected by the WGA, the guild also chose a handful of genre movies including the teen comedy \"Booksmart\" and Rian Johnson's whodunit \"Knives Out.\"\nThe awards will be presented on Feb. 1 in concurrent ceremonies in Los Angeles and New York. On Tuesday, the Directors Guild and the Producers Guild announce their nominees."}, {"text": "BERLIN - News on the first day of the Berlin Festival that film - read Constantin Film\u00a0 - had helped drive a 2019 full year profits surge at parent Highlight Communications came as little surprise. Few European movie companies enjoy the robust health of Constantin Film.Oliver Berben's presentation on Monday of Constantin Television's lineup and production philosophy at the Berlinale Series Market is a reminder that Constantin Film not only has some of the most ambitious movie productions coming out of Europe - think Paul W.S. Anderson's upcoming \"Monster Hunter\" - but now fires ever more on multiple powerful cylinders. Few senior executives in Europe are in a more privileged position to survey the ever evolving landscape of content production than Martin Moszkowicz, Constantin Film chairman of the executive board and one of the great analysts of bigger company bigger picture dynamics.\nIn the final build-up to the 70th Berlin Festival, he fielded questions on how the Berlin market was shaping up, twinning theatrical and TV, platforms' movie interest, the future of theatrical, and the \"Parasite\" effect:\nHow has this market changed in recent years? What does that mean for you, and what role does Berlin play for Constantin?\nThese days U.S. studios hardly ever do deals just for domestic. Markets are going to focus on lower-budgeted or smaller, niche-type movies.\nBut there is also so much more to Berlin than just the competition and the market. For us, as a German company, Berlin is the most important festival of the year. We take a group of 40 people, and there's always so much happening: political meetings, industry presentations, networking events and more. So, for us these 10 days are huge in general, and for our company we use it to present ourselves, to buy product if there is any, sell our Films and to talk with friends from all over the world and to network. So, for me the importance of Berlin is unquestionable. Some years the market is better, some years not so. But overall, we try to look at it with an open mind. We don't go in with a quota we want to fill, we look at films on a case by case basis.\nSome predicted streaming platforms as the death of brick and mortar cinema, but would you agree?\nYou can see in the numbers that successful theatrical movies, once they go to the platforms, do better than everything else. I think it's always important to take a bird's eye view, where you see the whole market and what it means. I don't see this Armageddon that some people have been predicting; it's just changing. I don't remember a year, in whatever 40-something years that I've been in the business, that there were no changes. There's always something. When DVD came out everybody said: \"Oh my God, everybody is going to watch on DVD, nobody will go go to the movies anymore.\" For nearly a hundred years people have been predicting the end of the film industry, and it's not happened yet, and it's not going to happen. On the contrary - movies are alive and kicking...\nAre new platforms as interested in films as they are in series?\nThey are interested in both, I must say. There is still definite interest in 100-minute, feature film-type stories. All the services have this problem of series taking up so much of their users' time that people are sometimes hesitant to get into a series that requires so much commitment. So sometimes shorter and more marketable one-time events are preferable. The streamers are all in the business of building their platforms. They aren't interested in one specific thing being a big hit. They are interested in getting more subscribers. They are looking for things that make the platform marketable. They want to reach quadrants they don't already have.\nHow has that impacted the way producers work?\nNo company does only theatrical or only TV. Everyone, to some degree, does both. Most producers mix movies and TV. There's more demand, and we're billing that, as are most creatives, writers, directors, below the line. They're all busy, all over Europe, probably the world.\nAnd one way to find potential subscribers is to get high profile content with big media coverage.\nAbsolutely. Look at \"The Irishman.\" It's not one of Scorsese's best films. But the attention it got with cast and director was outstanding. I think that's what they were aiming at. So that worked out for Netflix. They wanted to make a splash and make a film no studio would touch, and I think that's great!\nThe success of a film like \"Parasite\" - Could that signal a renaissance of accessible, slightly bigger art films?\nI'm not sure if it can be viewed as a blueprint. With \"Parasite\" you have an outstandingly talented group of artists led by one of the great directors of our time. I'm not sure there are many like him out there who can do similar things. Although I'm sure some will try. I think \"Parasite\" is singular in terms of pure talent and creativity. I'm not saying it's impossible for others to do the same, but you cannot just use it as a blueprint and repeat it. It's so dependent on execution. Without a brilliant director and his team, I'm not sure the same story could have turned out so well.\nIt's fantastic for our business though. I think it's great the Academy Awards selected it. I was not one of those who thought it could win. You hear people say it's because they there are more Academy members from other countries it will keep being more international, and I say that's a good thing in general. But I don't think you can say because of \"Parasite\" every country will suddenly do huge, high-concept arthouse movies. Good directors will always get their movies made, and there are a handful of the same stature as Bong Joon Ho, and they will get things done.\nMore from Variety\nEurope-China Co-Prod 'The Italian Recipe' Immune to Coronavirus (EXCLUSIVE)      \u00a0    'Persian Lessons': Film Review      \u00a0    Beta Cinema Celebrates 'Karnawal' (EXCLUSIVE)"}, {"text": "\u201cParasite\u201d hits Hulu.

What's our take home?\nThe remarkable feat of Parasite is not just a fluke or tsamba in our local lingo. It was, in fact, the culmination of decades of sustained growth of South Korean cinema. It was inevitable and, had been a long time coming, to be sure. Korean films have been reaping awards in Cannes and Berlin, Venice and other international festivals. Breakthrough films like Oldboy and Burning helped pave the way for Parasite toward the Academy Awards.\nThe cultural environment is ripe for it. Korean cinema, together with the entire K-pop culture, has become global as Korean movies and tele-novelas are now ubiquitously watched around the world. Korean movies have even broke global box-office records, like Miracle in Cell No. 7, The Host and Train to Busan. Bong Joon-ho, Park Chan-wook and other Korean directors have directed Hollywood movies, a recognition of their expertise and craftsmanship. Even Korean actors like Lee Byung-hun and Ma Dong-seok have been appearing in some Hollywood movies. South Korea's Busan International Film Festival has now become Asia's largest and most important film festival.\nAs a cinephile for over 60 years now (I saw my first film in 1957), I have seen the rise of Korean cinema in terms not only of output but level of quality. I was a fan of Korean glossy blockbusters and creative genre films, which began to emerge in the late 1990s and 2000s, and started to attract significant international attention. Thanks to the proficient subtitling of their films, the rest of the world acquired a taste for them.\nBut it should be noted that while they score big in international film festivals, South Korean films are being patronized by local audiences.\nAudience support. That's the key factor in their success. They had a ready audience for them. To me, it's the missing piece in our efforts to level up our local cinema. In our good-intentioned eagerness and enthusiasm to cultivate new filmmakers through film festivals, we may have forgotten the other part of the equation: the audience.\nSure, we have all these indie film festivals designed to offer films that are a notch higher in terms of content and style than what are being shown in the more mainstream, avowedly more commercial MMFF, Cinemalaya, QCinema, Cinema One Originals and so on. They are held one after the other, year after year. It's a virtual cornucopia of fresh new films by our young filmmakers. But there is one problem: the mainstream audience does not come to these festivals.\nFor festival organizers, the gauge of commercial success is so low. An audience of 5,000 for a 10-day festival is already something to brag about. (Disclosure: I am part of the technical working group of QCinema International Film Festival, so I would know).\nMaybe Filipino viewers are not made aware enough about these festivals, or they simply resist going to these festivals. So how can we give them a taste of what a good film is when they don't queue up in spite of the incentive of a much lower ticket price?\nThe common beef about indie film festivals is that they are closed events; it's where you see the usual faces-elite and effete film cognoscenti and culturati who are into precious little art films. The dismissive justification is: if you don't get it, it's not for you. The upshot is only a few care to watch them. No wonder some cynics say that the term indie is derived from the expression 'indie pinapanood.'\nTrue or not, this snobbish aura attached to indie film festivals nevertheless needs to change if festivals are to stay vibrant and sustainable. Rather than be excluded, ordinary citizens need to be encouraged to see these less watched films. They need to be coaxed, beguiled, and won over into becoming appreciative of films not for their star value, but for their content and craftsmanship. Let's widen the circle exponentially, to include more and more, year after year.\nThe bottom line: let's not only make good films, let's also build the audience-people who will be taught to be critical and demanding. To echo the latest marketing buzz, let's open up a 'blue ocean' market and create new demand for well-made meaningful but engaging films. Let's make watching indie films fashionable or, should I say, 'cool.' That takes education and wider exposure.\nIn this light, I think Quezon City is in the right direction. Mayor Joy Belmonte hit the nail on the head in her keynote speech at the Seventh annual QCinema Awards, when she broached her idea about film viewers becoming educated jurors of films themselves and expanding the market for QCinema.\nMayor Belmonte said something about campus roadshows, which include the showing of QCinema winners with short lectures and open discussions. That's smart. Let's start them while they are young. To bring QCinema's cinematic feast down to the grassroots, there have also been free film showings in the city's barangays. Beyond the pleasure of watching, let's stimulate discussions in the school, with family and friends and our different interpretations of the same film. As Mayor Belmonte puts it: 'Cinema is a social activity\u2026the meaning of a movie does not lie solely within the film itself but in the interaction of the film and the audience.'\nIndeed, let's encourage ordinary moviegoers to write reviews and be vocal about films. Sort of turning every moviegoer into a lay Richard Bolisay or Pauline Kael. This way we are actually taking part in the progress of our filmmakers, by pushing the boundaries of their imagination and creativity.\nMaking a 'cinezen' out of every citizen makes business sense. With every 'woke' moviegoer, the market continues to expand for quality film festivals, giving the mainstream commercial circuit a run for its money. By giving voice to an ordinary cinezen's passion for cinema that is meaningful, provocative and progressive, may this one humble opinion stimulate more exciting discussions about the many ways to help put our cinema industry on the global stage (or, should I say, screen) in the years to come.\nLet's hope that other film festival organizers, as well as universities, would invest in pursuing developmental activities along the line of film appreciation and film criticism. Let us build critical, demanding cinema goers who will be the foundation for a vibrant new Philippine cinema that would, one day, make world history like Parasite.\nSo, hopefully, in the next editions of local film festivals, we won't see the usual faces again and again."}, {"text": "Mar 02, 2020( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Just as local audiences flocked to this year's Berlinale on its 70th anniversary, its European Film Market attracted more than 11,000 visitors, up 500 from last year \u2014 even after over 60 Chinese delegates withdrew. That said: Sales were down. At perhaps the only Berlinale ever to take place after the Oscars, Bong Joon Ho's Best Picture-winner and global blockbuster 'Parasite' was top of mind. However, buyers quickly decided that the accessible arthouse breakout will be hard to duplicate. \n''Parasite' was a good thing,' said EFM head Matthijs Wouter Knol. 'People came to the market with high spirits about the chance for arthouse films to be discovered. Sadly, the arthouse film in reality these past days is struggling; it's not the most easy part of cinema. That some people went home disappointed with their results doesn't take away the fact that films like 'Parasite' do have a chance.' Here are further gleanings from Berlin[1].The middle ground is shrinking.'Things change market to market,' said one UK seller. 'Everyone says 'the AFM is over,' 'Cannes is slow.' It depends what packages are available. Every territory is saying the same thing: They want huge, commercial projects that compete with studios \u2014action-genre stuff at the right price \u2014 but then they want cool, hooky arthouse stuff to buy cheap and break out that is not risky.' Several big titles sold at the EFM, notably 'The Good Nurse,' Danish filmmaker Tobias Lindholm's English-language debut, adapted by Krysty Wilson-Cairn ('1917') from Charles Graeber's non-fiction book about a notorious nurse (Jessica Chastain) who killed 400 patients via air embolism. After FilmNation and Lionsgate discussed a possible North American deal to pay for the film and sell territories worldwide, Netflix plunked down a reported $25 million to back the package co-starring Eddie Redmayne. Other hot sales titles were the Gerard Butler actioner 'Remote Control,' Mike Mills' untitled road movie starring Oscar-winner Joaquin Phoenix[2] as an artist in charge of his brainy nephew, and the Robert Pattinson-Margaret Qualley romance 'The Stars at Noon,' which presold to A24. Also for sale from Endeavor Content was Maggie Gyllenhaal's directing debut 'The Lost Daughter,' starring Olivia Colman, Jessie Buckley, and Dakota Johnson. 'The stuff in the middle, it's such a risk for theatrical distributors,' continued the UK distributor. 'Globally, people are not going to see that in cinemas. They wait to see that on streaming, on Netflix in a few months. Cinema is an event-based business. People have to be driven out of their home. Look at 'Parasite,' which is so unique and different. But it might never happen again.' Myriad Pictures principal Kirk D'Amicoagreed. 'The middle is missing,' he said. 'Fewer distributors like Wild Bunch are in the middle. It's a tough place to be.'It's feast or famine.'The feedback we got from buyers and sellers was that the kind of business done in Berlin was different than expected,' said Knol. 'Even after the upheaval and enthusiasm for 'Parasite,' there was more success in the mainstream content market than the arthouse market.' While some Sundance titles like Phyllida Lloyd's 'Herself and the Dreamhorse' (Cornerstone Films) and Brandon Cronenberg's horrific 'Possessor' (Arclight) were selling, much of what was for sale in Berlin, nobody wanted. 'Sales agents were anxious,' said one arthouse buyer, who said he was pitched countless projects that were just too small, many of them co-productions financed with local subsidies. 'Tons of little movies won't play without name directors or cast. They're either too arthouse, or too mainstream.' 'I haven't seen those films I am waiting for,' said one European distributor over coffee at the Hyatt industry hub. 'There's a big gap between the top three titles and lots of arthouse films. It's important to be very picky and choose the right ones that reach out to audiences.' Berlinale titles that sold to North America were German auteur Christian Petzold's mermaid romance 'Undine' (IFC) starring Best Actress-winner and rising star Paula Beer, and documentarian Victor Kossakovsky's 'Gunda,' a one-of-a-kind black-and-white portrait of a pig (Neon). Bleecker pre-bought North America on two films, Sally Potter's weak Competition dementia drama 'The Roads Not Taken' and John Patrick Shanley romance 'Wild Mountain Thyme,' starring Emily Blunt and Jamie Dornan, a market title. Iranian Golden Bear-winner 'There Is No Evil,'[3] a powerful anthology of four different executioner stories that runs 158 minutes, generated high European buyer interest, but could be a hard sell in North America. Johnny Depp vehicle 'Minimata' proved to be a soft stateside sell, as did Matteo Garrone's Italian hit 'Pinocchio' starring Roberto Benigni, a dark tale that falls between family and arthouse, and two Memento Films International titles, Berlinale opener 'My Salinger Year,' starring Sigourney Weaver and Margaret Qualley, and Vadim Perelman's 'Persian Stories.' Distributors looking for foreign-language buys always track prizes and likely Oscar submissions. Italy is more likely to submit Nanni Moretti's upcoming Cannes entry. And similarly, Philippe Garrel's portrait of a womanizer, 'The Salt of Tears,' is unlikely to be high on France's Oscar list. Brazilian film 'All the Dead Ones' is not seen as Brazil's Oscar entry. And strong Argentinan hopeful 'The Intruder' could have used a Berlinale prize.Caution rules.There's a time-honored practice ofpresellIng foreign territories to finance a film, often by cutting footage into a two-to-three-minute sizzle reel. (Roadside Attractions pre-bought 'Judy' off a promo at Cannes 2018 .) However, that strategy doesn't work if everyone waits to screen the final product. Said the UK seller, 'People are buying less off script. In my last two markets, territories that would have been straight up prebuys and wouldn't have hesitated are becoming more reticent to put down money early. If it has cast, it sells much easier.' This is particularly true for North American sales. 'North America ends up being the last thing sold,' said Jason Scoggins, president and COO of online financing market Slated. 'Most finance plans put a zero in there, assuming they will have something at some time. If you've got good product, you will get interest from buyers and they desperately need the stuff. They don't want to take risk on yet another programmatic action movie thriller. Familiarity is a problem. You need bold choices and recognizable names.' On the other hand, who needs a theatrical North American deal when the streamers are willing to overpay? A domestic backstop deal used to be desirable; now sellers are eager to keep their options open, as P...osts can risk as much as $20 million-$40 million. 'There are other ways to get your money back,' said Scoggins.Stars are less available.Deep-pocketed streamers like Netflix are luring the name draws beloved by foreign buyers. Producers make wish lists based on predetermined foreign-sales values, which are often out of date; this is why 'Lord of the Rings' star Liv Tyler or 'Harry Potter' stars Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe can get movies made, along with 'Twilight' stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson and Daisy Ridley of 'Star Wars' fame. Who's hot in the foreign sales world is determined by 'a bunch of old white guys not changing with the times,' said one film packager. 'They'll start dying off, and the next generation will come in and there will be more change and flexibility.' International stars are crucial to driving box office. But these days the stars aren't available; even studios compete to get a slot on their busy schedules. 'The streamers are making it hard to secure talent as well as stages like Babelsberg and Pinewood,' said Scoggins. 'Netflix and Amazon have a huge amount of volume.'Streamers dominate.Netflix is making inroads on local production. So will its six competitors: Amazon, Hulu, Apple, Disney+, Peacock, and HBO Max. 'They have no choice but to go global,' said Scoggins. Streamers use different metrics for what they spend. Their goal is to provide enough fresh, original content to lure more subscribers. The more subscribers they have, the more they can spend. This makes things tougher for the indies and studios that try to compete with them. 'There's a reduction of independent films getting made and bonded,' said D'Amico, 'due to the economics of competing for cast and directors with streamers.' While studios are forced to pay top dollar, smaller indies have an advantage in their inability to chase the most expensive talent: They can make do with less. On the other hand, 'Streamers don't have a lot of appetite now that they are producing their own content,' said Memento International managing director milie Georges, who last year sold Kristen Stewart vehicle 'Seberg' to Amazon. 'As for the U.S., indie films were very active for a period and now are very occasionally interested in finished content.' Knol said the highest delegations of EFM buyers came from Amazon and Netflix in 2019 and 2020. 'Other platforms were present, but not so visible,' he added. 'This year, people had meetings with Apple TV, Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock. They do affect the market in a big way and influence what other buyers can offer, what deals are made.' According to Unifrance executives Serge Toubiana and Daniela Elstner, the French film industry is reconsidering its carefully constructed sharing of theater and television revenues with producers, in order to include Netflix. 'People in Europe start joining forces, finding ways to protect their local markets,which have carefully built up infrastructures to secure funding and co-production, which are directly affected by Netflix buyers,' Knol said. 'Netflix and Amazon have started in Europe commissioning content with independent producers. Strong producer associations and European funding bodies got together, feeling the need to do something to protect the infrastructure we have, in an attempt to say, 'If streaming platforms are commissioning content from indie producers, they should contribute.''Networking and human connection are good.Plenty of people use the EFM for face-to-face meetings; even Slated's Scoggins returned to Berlin to set up more projects like its biggest hit to date, 'Super Troopers 2.' Slated also attends markets in Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, and the AFM. In Berlin, Scoggins was ramping up production on 'Shark Attack,' which came to Slated's Advisor division via a debt financier he met in Berlin last year. 'Our main goal is to connect with people from Europe and other countries we don't see at other markets, sales agents we know or don't yet know, as well as sitting down with new and existing producers and connecting them with people we know,' he said. 'Slated's platform matches film financiers and projects with financing sales and distribution. We use the network and people and companies on the platform to surface projects that are the most likely to succeed commercially and artistically.'

Quentin Tarantino's \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,\" which won best screenplay Sunday at the Globes, was ineligible.

The various actors who comprised the pic's wealthy Park family and the plucky, impoverished Kims were each already big stars at home in South Korea. But after becoming the surprise darlings of this year's awards season, culminating in a best picture win, producers and sales agents are anticipating an Oscars bump befitting their newfound global name recognition.\nKorean acting legend\u00a0Song Kang-ho\u00a0, who played the patriarch of the Kim family in Parasite, was by far the biggest name of the cast, having starred in many of the most influential Korean films of the past two decades, including Bong Joon Ho's prior hits Memories of Murder,The HostandSnowpiercer, as well as acclaimed works from Park Chan-wook (Joint Security Area, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance), Kim Jee-woon (The Good, the Bad, the Weird), Lee Chang-dong (Secret Sunshine) and others. Shortly after Parasite's release, Song told The Hollywood Reporter that he had little interest in \"crossing over\" to Hollywood. \"Although I only make Korean films, helping these films be universal and have global influence is something that suits me better,\" he said.\nAfter having helped Parasiteachieve just that, Song appears unlikely to change course. He is currently shooting a big-budget Korean disaster film, Emergency Declaration, directed by Han Jae-rim and co-starring fellow A-list leading man Lee Byung-hun.\nChoi Woo-shik, who played Kim Ki-woo, the son of the poor family, appears most likely to make a post-Oscar international pivot. Raised in Canada, Choi is bilingual and was recently offered the lead role in A24's upcoming Korea-set love storyPast Lives, produced by Scott Rudin. Choi's agency in Seoul tells THRthat he's still reviewing the part. In the meantime, he's busy shooting the upcoming Korean police thriller The Policeman's Lineage, based on a best-selling Japanese novel. Choi also stars in the dystopian thriller Time to Hunt, one of just two high-profile Korean titles premiering at this year's Berlinale.\nThis media is not available on this platform.\n\"The film has certainly attracted more buzz among the reporters and buyers after the Oscar announcement,\" says a representative for All That Cinema, Time to Hunt's PR company. Contents Panda, which is handling international sales on the title, similarly says it has received a surprise boost in buyer interest after the Oscars thanks to Choi's starring presence.\nLee Sun-kyun, who played the detached and deep-voiced Park family patriarch, is set to star in director Byun Sunghyun's upcoming film King Maker, playing a presidential campaign strategist in the 1960s.\nPerhaps the most memorable breakout star of Parasite for international audiences, Park So-dam, who played the Kim family daughter, aka the sly \"Miss Jessica,\" an \"art tutor from Illinois,\" was exposed to international audiences before the Oscars. Park's Seoul-based agency Artist Company tellsTHR that she already has received several Hollywood offers, but that they are remaining cautious. \"Nothing has been decided yet, but we are open to exploring roles that best suit the actor,\" an agency spokesman says.\nCho Yeo-jeong, who memorably played the naive wife and mother of the Park family in Parasite, tells THR that she also already has been approached with several offers from international studios. The actress realizes the Oscar halo tends to be fleeting, so she's looking for another indelible character, perhaps one with a bit more backbone this time. \"I still haven't made up my mind,\" she says. \"I've also got some other offers for Korean movies and I'm thinking very carefully about what should come next.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\nThis story first appeared inThe Hollywood Reporter's Feb. 22 daily issue at the Berlin International Film Festival.\nLink to Image"}, {"text": "Jan 19, 2020( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Several Best Picture Oscar contenders got a box office boost from their nominations this weekend, including NEON's 'Parasite' and Searchlight's 'Jojo Rabbit,' both of which had their theater counts significantly expanded to accommodate renewed audience interest. 'Parasite' expanded by nearly 500 screens to 843 locations, adding $2.1 million over the 4-day weekend to bring its total to $28.1 million. \nThe Bong Joon-ho film became the first Korean movie ever to earn a nomination for Best Picture and took six nominations in all, including Best International Film, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. 'Jojo Rabbit,' meanwhile, added 895 screens to bring its total to 1,005, the largest expansion of any Oscar contender. The result is a $1.8 million total over the 4-day weekend, bringing its total to $23.8 million. 'Jojo Rabbit' was one of two films that Scarlett Johansson earned Oscar nominations for, taking a Best Supporting Actress nod for her work here to go with her Best Actress nod for 'Marriage Story. 'Jojo' took six nominations overall, including Best Adapted Screenplay for writer-director Taika Waititi. Among new releases, the highest profile arrival is GKIDS' anime film 'Weathering With You,' Makoto Shinkai's follow-up to the Japanese box office record breaker 'Your Name.' After a series of select fan screenings on Wednesday and Thursday via Fathom Events, the film was released on 500 screens and is estimated to earn $2.1 million for a per screen average of $4,245 and an overall total of $5.1 million.While reviews haven't been as strong as 'Your Name,' they are still overwhelmingly positive with critics and audience scores at 94% on Rotten Tomatoes.
