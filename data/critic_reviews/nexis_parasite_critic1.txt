Jan 27, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite[1] is taking Hollywood by storm[2] this award season. In fact, the South Korean release is gearing up as a Best Picture frontrunner[3] heading into Oscars 2020. Director Bong Joon-ho's latest film defies genre to tell a complex story about two interconnected families and, by extension, delivers some crucial social commentary[4].With Parasite#8216;s success, we're sure moviegoers will be interested to see some of Bong's previous work. Prior to his Oscar-nominated hit[5], the director had made six films. Here's a quick breakdown of the features he has directed throughout his career. 
 Bong Joon-ho and the cast of #8216;Parasite' at the Screen ActorsGuild Awards | John Sciulli/Getty Images for Turner#8216;Barking Dogs Never Bite' (2000)Barking Dogs Never Bite (Trailer)[6]In his 2000 directorial debut, Bong already aimed to combine genres in an innovative way. This dark comedy-drama follows an unemployed college professor (Lee Sung-jae) who begins abusing and kidnapping dogs the barking dogs in his apartment building. At the same time, a young woman (Bae Doona) takes note of his activities, launching an investigation into the surge of missing dogs. Despite its bizarre-sounding premise, Barking Dogs Never Bite gave Bong the chance to try his hand at directing a feature. Prior to this film, the [7]Parasite[8] filmmaker[9] had only directed three short films. However, he previously earned writing credits on 1997's Motel Cactus and 1999's Phantom: The Submarine. #8216;Memories of Murder' (2003)Memories of Murder (2003) - movie trailer[10]In his 2003 sophomore effort, Bong landed his first collaboration with Song Kang-ho. The actor delivers a critically acclaimed standout performance in [11]Parasite[12]. Song has sustained an ongoing collaboration with Bong over the course of both their careers.In Memories of Murder, the actor andKim Sang-kyung play two detectives trying to solve the real-life case of Korea's first serial murders. The investigation continued from 1986 to 1991, and the film — based on a 1996 play — earned strong reviews for its depiction and performances. #8216;The Host' (2006)The Host (2006) #8212; Trailer[13]Memories of Murder gained Bong international acclaim. But The Host solidified him as a commercially successful filmmaker. The film follows a man's (Song) effort to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped by a giant monster.At the time of its release, The Host became the highest-grossing South Korean movie of all time. Although mainstream success in the United States eluded Bong, this film was a critical step in establishing his reputation for offbeat, inventive genre projects.  #8216;Mother' (2009)Mother Official HD Trailer - From the Director of THE HOST[14]No, this one has nothing to do with either the 1996 Albert Brooks film or the 2017 Darren Aronofsky release[15]. Rather, this Mother follows a mother's (Kim Hye-ja) search for the killer responsible for framing her son (Won Bin) for murder.It might not have received as much attention stateside as some of Bong's other films. However, Mother was still a critical smash in South Korea and beloved by critics. As has become Bong's trademark, the movie expertly combines a number of genres, including family drama, horror, and comedy. #8216;Snowpiercer' (2013)Snowpiercer Official US Release Trailer #1 (2014) - Chris Evans Movie HD[16]Bong made his English-language directorial debut with this dystopian sci-fi thriller. Led by Chris Evans, the film features an all-star cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Ed Harris, and — of course — Song. It's also the most expensive Korean production in history.Snowpiercer is set aboard the titular train, which carries the last remnants of the human race. The film tackles key issues such as climate change but does so in a way that never fails to be thrilling. In fact, its success — much like that of [17]Parasite[18] — has inspired a new TV series[19]. #8216;Okja' (2017)Okja | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix[20]This Netflix film might be a lot of moviegoers' first exposure to Bong. Part of that comes from its accessibility on the streaming service. Yet, Okja — Bong's second consecutive English-language release[21] — is just as much in line with his distinctive sensibility as his other films.The movie centers on a genetically modified creature named Okja, its friendship with a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun), and her efforts to protect it. Okja also features an international cast which combines South Korean performers with stars like Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and Swinton.

Parasite Movie Review: Bong Joon Ho film is like poetry

How does one get rid of a parasite?
Bong Joon Ho sets the tone for the Oscar-nominated, Cannes Palme d'Or 2019-winner and Golden Globes 2020 Best Foreign Language Film-winner Parasite in the first scene itself. A family of four, living in a semi-basement level home, scouts the corners of their house to find WiFi signal. The neighbour must have changed the password, let's try 123456789 or in reverse. Still not working? Oops, no WhatsApp then.
Kim Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho) leads an unambitious family with wife Chung-sook (played by Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Kim Ki-jeong (played by Park So-dam) and son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik). Their current source of income is folding pizza boxes for a pizza delivery joint, and it doesn't take someone solid knowledge in World Cinema to know that that money isn't going to be enough to feed four grown mouths. But, they have a plan, as Kim Ki-taek elaborates - it is to not have a plan at all. For then, the risk of anything going wrong is nil.
Watch the trailer of Parasite here:
Parasite is, therefore, a story of submission. On one end of the spectrum, the Kim family has submitted to their condition never improving, of scavenging through life. On the other end of the spectrum, the Park family has submitted to never peeping out of their ivory towers. They don't need to. Their ivory towers are guarded with surveillance cameras and windows are sealed with tempered glasses, monitoring even the sunlight seeping in. Led by Park Dong-ik (played by Lee Sun-kyun) with wife Yeon-gyo (played by Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Park Da-hye (played by Jeong Ji-so) and son Park Da-song (played by Jung Hyeon-jun), the Park family doesn't live in a bubble; they live in a fortress, fortified by wilful ignorance.
Read: Why Bong Joon Ho's Parasite rises beyond the subtitle barrier
And then their worlds collide. The Kim family slowly and steadily creeps into the Park family, landing odd jobs with them, eliminating the competition as they move ahead. The son takes up the job of the English tutor replacing a friend, the daughter becomes the art teacher to the son, playing a hapless (and clueless) mother; the father lands the job of the driver replacing the older one, and finally, the older housekeeper is practically thrown out overnight and replaced with the mother. All this without letting the Parks catch a whiff that the Kims know each other, lest their finally steady quadruple income is snatched away. But the whiff is too strong, too strong coming from poverty.
The more they collide, the more apparent their differences get. They are separated by class, a difference that is almost flowing in their bloodstreams now, they are basically sweating class difference. It appears the Kims have gotten so used to living in hiding that they'd prefer living the life of a parasite, rather than disclose they are related and have a fair chance at being judged on the basis of their good work. Even they don't think they are worth it. Of course, the Parks don't either.
Through Parasite, Bong Joon Ho gives you a very clear picture of the South Korean society, or of any other place where unequal distribution and growth of wealth have resulted in the 'rich becoming richer, poor becoming poorer' model. This could very well be the story of a family living in the slums of Dharavi, juxtaposed against another living in that plush skyrise on Altamount Road, both in Mumbai. Which is why it hits so hard.
In Parasite, the cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and editing by Jinmo Yang (nominated in the Best Achievement in Film Editing category at Oscars 2020) deserve a special mention. Staring out the window at Parks', you soak in the lush green of their front yard, while at the Kims', there's a drunkard peeing at the lamppost, who wouldn't stop even if you were to throw a bucket of water at him. But the visuals of those water droplets twinkling against the light from the lamppost, in slow motion, and the good laugh the have-nots like the Kim family share at that moment, is like poetry.
The storytelling style of Parasite is also unique. Bong Joon Ho goes from dark comedy to absurd comedy, to simply dark, and then darker. Finally, it touches a point of hope, and while one could look at it as just hope, it could also be the point where the film reached its darkest - for there is no hope. Let's just submit to that, shall we?
Bong Joon Ho had said at an interview that the idea for Parasite had been in his brain for a while - like a parasite, if you will. We're glad he didn't get rid of it, though.
(The Delhi premiere of Parasite was organised by the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in India.)

#8216;Parasite' Director Bong Joon Ho Says the Architect of His Movie House Thought He Was #8216;An Idiot'

Feb 10, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Oscars certainly don't think Bong Joon Ho is an idiot. They honored him awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best International Feature[1] for Parasite. HBO doesn't either. They're developing a            https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bong-joon-hos-parasite-slated-for-hbo-show-what-we-know.html/TV serie[2]s based on the film. 
However, not everyone making Parasite was so enamored with Director[3] Bong. The architect who built the house in which Bong set the film[4] had strong words for him. Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment Parasite is now available on DVD and Blu-ray[5]. In the bonus features, Bong gives a Q&A at a film festival screening. Here is the story of why the architect of the Parasite house called Bong an idiot. Bong Joon Ho built the house into the #8216;Parasite' script The Park family house was the central location of all the events in Parasite. The Kim family installs themselves as help in the Park house and that's where things get crazy[6]. The Parks' lavish house had to be built to spec for Bong. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-sik in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;Even since we began building the set for the rich house, I had a lot of requests. I already had a basic sketch of the house structure in mind when I was writing the script. Without that certain structure, it was almost impossible to tell the narrative. Also there are a lot of things that were necessary for the story in terms of the structure. If some characters are talking here, another character had to eavesdrop or peak. You had to be able to see the staircase through the front door. There were these several requirements I had.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayBong Joon Ho consulted a real architect for #8216;Parasite' Bong sent production designer Lee Ha-jun to meet with real architects about the Parasite house. The architects were not fond of the screenplay's demands. L-R: Choi Woo-Shik, Song Kang-ho, Chang Hyae-jin and Park So-dam in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;So the production designer actually sought out advice from actual architects to build this house. The production designer would take my request to the actual architect and the architect would be like, #8216;What kind of idiot would build houses this way? No one builds houses this way. So the architect would come back to me with those comments and I would still have all these things that I requested from him. So he really suffered between me and the architect. Ultimately the house came out beautifully. I was able to get all the structure and the blocking that the story required.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayOne scene that paid off the unorthodox in #8216;Parasite' An example of a scene that utilized the specific design of the house is one in which the Kims hide in the bedroom while the Parks have sex. Bong Joon Ho and interpreter Sharon Choi | Kevin Winter/Getty Images #8216;In reality it's very rare for the rich and poor to come so close to each other that they can smell one another. In this film you have situations where they come very close to one another through tutoring or housekeeping and driving. And that sex scene is sort of on the pinnacle of that strange intimacy. It's not really about the sex. It's about the family that's hiding under the table and peeping at that very intimate part of their private lives. So I thought it would give a really powerful tension in the film.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayBong Joon Ho built more than the house The Park house was the major build for Parasite, but Bong had to build a few other sets for other scenes in the movie. Lee Sun-kyun and Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;Another thing that was difficult was the poor house and the neighborhood surrounding that house,#8217; Bong said. #8216;They were also sets that we built. Also because we had to flood the entire neighborhood, we built it in a giant swimming pool, a water tank and on the last day of shooting, we poured in sewage water. It looks like dirty water. It was very clean water for the actors. It had the face masks in the water, like mud face masks, very healthy and good for your skin.#8217; Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[7] [ 1]: https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-makes-history-with-2020-oscar-nominations-best-picture.html/ [ 2]:            https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bong-joon-hos-parasite-slated-for-hbo-show-what-we-know.html/ [ 3]:            https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/oscars-2020-what-movies-has-parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-made.html/ [ 4]:            https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/beyond-fest-review-parasite-peachy-con.html/ [ 5]:            https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-is-the-oscar-nominated-film-based-on-a-true-story.html/ [ 6]:            https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-explains-the-cruel-and-sad-ending-of-the-award-winning-film.html/ [ 7]:            https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-says-the-architect-of-his-movie-house-thought-he-was-an-idiot.html/

Donald Trump slams Oscars for awarding Best Picture to Parasite: What the hell was that all about?

President Donald Trump is apparently not a fan of Parasite, his biggest complaint being that the movie was made in South Korea. Trump started talking about the Academy Awards during a campaign rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on Thursday.
Parasite was named best picture, becoming the first non-English-language film to get the top honor.
"What the hell was that all about?" Trump said. We've got enough problems with South Korea with trade. On top of that, they give them the best movie of the year. Was it good? I don't know."
I was thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs tonight, beneath the majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains, with thousands of terrific, hardworking American Patriots. With your help, this November, we are going to defeat the Radical Socialist Dems, and we are going to WIN Colorado!  A post shared by            President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Feb 20, 2020 at 6:21pm PST
Neon, the US distributor for the subtitled film, shot back on Twitter, "Understandable. He can't read."
 Understandable, he can't read.#Parasite           #BestPicture           #Bong2020           https://t.co/lNqGJkUrDP NEON (@neonrated)            February 21, 2020
The audience booed when Trump mentioned the Academy Awards and then cheered when he said, "Can we get like Gone with the Wind back, please? Sunset Boulevard, so many great movies."
Parasite tells the story of how a family of four poor, unemployed people living in a slum basement apartment comically infiltrates a wealthy family residing at a luxurious mansion before things unravel violently and tragically.

Parasite director Bong Joon Ho was greeted with cheers and applause as he returned to South Korea on Sunday after his historic four-Oscar win. About 300 reporters and fans were waiting to greet Bong as he arrived at the Incheon International Airport.
"Thank you for the applause, I would like to send a round of applause back to you all for coping so well with the coronavirus," Bong said.
"I will join the effort to overcome the corona by washing my hands diligently. Happy to be home," he added.

Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win the best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards on Feb 9. It won a total of four Oscars, including best director and original screenplay for Bong Joon Ho and the best international feature film.
The film is a tale of two South Korean families - the wealthy Parks and the poor Kims - that mirrors the deepening disparities in Asia's fourth-largest economy and has struck a chord with global audiences.
Koreans have been celebrating for the past week.
Local cinemas and TV channels began a rerun of the film, as well as showing Bong's other films including Snowpiercer and Memories of Murder.
Bong and the cast of Parasite are scheduled to hold a press conference on Wednesday.

Parasite movie review: A subtle and subversive depiction of class

Parasite movie review: Bong Joon-Ho, who has also co-written the story, has several surprises and twists up his sleeve. And many metaphors.
Parasite movie cast: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam
Parasite movie director: Bong Joon-Ho
Parasite movie rating: 4 stars
Korean director Bong Joon-Ho's latest film, a top Oscar contender, is a subtle and subversive depiction of class. The setting is Korean, and Ho brings out that country's obsession with America, English, North Korea and aspirations succinctly. But in depicting the many layers that divide, and blind, the rich from the poor, the poor from the rich, the men from the women, the husbands from the wives, Parasite is universal. And very, very unsettling.
The rich are not all bad, and the poor not all good. However, it is in keeping up appearances, of both goodness and badness, that we maintain what passes off as order. And so it is that the well-to-do Parks welcome into their house, one by one, an entire family who take up various jobs around their home without them being any wiser. The husband takes no interest in running the household, the wife's worth lies in ensuring that he doesn't have to. That everything from kids' grades to their art faculties, the cooking to the washing, even the hiring and the sacking, doesn't demand any exertion from him.
They live in a "semi-basement", out of work but smart, ambitious and willing to cut corners to get ahead. The first to make his way into the Park home is Kevin, a smart man whose English can rival any university student's but who is held back for lack of a degree. He is hired as Park daughter's tutor. He gets his sister in for the Park son, a little boy whose mother is convinced he has eccentric artistic talent. The sister, Jessica, convinces the Park wife that what the son's feverish scribblings indicate is a childhood trauma, which "art therapy", costing a little extra, will cure. Kim (a Ho favourite) comes in as the chauffeur and man about the house and his wife as the housekeeper.
One night when the Parks are on a camping trip, Kim and family decide to have a nice little party. They talk about how nice the Parks are, and whether it's the money that makes them so, or whether it's the fact that money means they are left with "no resentments". Looking on at the front yard through large French windows, as a storm builds, they are imagining owning a house such as this, when their nightmare starts.
Ho, who has also co-written the story, has several surprises and twists up his sleeve. And many metaphors. About upstairs, downstairs. Loyalty, love. Virtue, vice. Gutter, smell. Casual affluence, deliberate offence. Rain/sun, floods/heat. The wool we pull over our eyes as we turn the other way, telling ourselves some lies to help us do that, even as we draw lines that are "not to be crossed".
Ho strips that wool off, thread by thread. Right down to the only truth there is, not education, not degree, not work - money.

Parasite movie review: Bong Joon-ho's sensational masterpiece is the first great film of the new decade

India, Jan. 29 -- ParasiteDirector - Bong Joon-hoCast - Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Chang Hyae-jin, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Jung-eun
Depending on how you perceive the world, Bong Joon-ho's grand validation by the West can either be appreciated as a long-overdue acknowledgement of his formidable filmography, or it can be dismissed as yet another sign of the Oscars' irrelevance in identifying true legends. I find myself somewhere in between.
Shall I let the pomp and pageantry of the Academy Awards convince me that my respect for Bong has in some way been inadequate for all these years, or should I simply ignore the attention he's getting all of a sudden, convinced that America is simply late to the party?
Watch the Parasite trailer here
Director Bong, as he's affectionately (and reverentially) addressed by his cast and crew, has made four bona fide classics in his career; each of them of a different genre. His 2003 monster movie, The Host, was seen as an admonishment of American arrogance; in Okja, he skewered the food industry like a spicy tikka; and in Snowpiercer, his finest film, Director Bong confronted the notion of God.
But unlike his contemporaries, Park Chan-wook or Kim Ki-duk, Bong has largely operated in genre cinema, bringing his instantly recognisable idiosyncrasies - shocking tonal shifts, razor-sharp satire and delightfully dark humour - to subjects that other directors would typically address with solemnity.
The genre-fluid Parasite is like a greatest hits record -- cool, clinical, and incisive. It is an outlet for him to address all of his anxieties as a filmmaker, but also as a citizen of the modern world.
The theme of capitalism is once again brought up as Bong pits the rich Park family against the poor Kim clan, peppering the film with references to Native Americans and building towards an operatic crescendo in which class warfare takes on the form of a literal battle. After previously tackling climate change in Snowpiercer, Bong once again highlights the importance of the crisis, by shedding light on how it affects the rich and the poor differently. While the Park family is only slightly inconvenienced by a torrential downpour, the Kims' entire existence is threatened when the same downpour floods their subterranean home.
Sometimes, Bong makes his points rather bluntly, like the scene in which the patriarch of the Kim family, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is barely able to hide his anger when the matriarch of the Park family, Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), says that the rains have cleared the skies. Mere hours ago, his home was submerged; Yeon-gyo's apathy towards Ki-taek's plight is more insulting to him than when she scrunches up her nose at his 'poor person smell'.
The scene takes place inside a car, which reminded me of a similar moment in Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, in which Ranveer Singh's Murad is reminded of the metaphorical distance between himself and the rich woman he's driving, despite their physical proximity to each other.
Ki-taek works as a chauffeur for the Parks, after having successfully infiltrated the wealthy family with his wife and kids. Both clans rely upon the other; while the Parks wouldn't be able to function without the invisible services provided by the Kims, the Kims depend on the Parks' money to survive. There are no heroes or villains in the film; everyone's a parasite.
Bong relies on his craft to make confrontational statements about class - his use of staircases as a visual metaphor for social mobility is remarkable. Such is the regularity with which he cuts to a character either climbing or descending stairs, that Parasite begins to resemble a sort of cinematic Ludo. The Parks' magnificent bungalow is accessed after a steady uphill climb, while the Kims literally live underneath the rich and the powerful; bereft of not only wealth and opportunities, but also sunlight.
The Parks' home, wonderfully constructed by Bong's production designer, Lee Ha-jun, has several internal staircases, perhaps suggesting that even within certain socioeconomic groups, maintaining one's position is an equally cutthroat business. The film is shot like a thriller, and despite his typical tonal transitions, Bong alternately conjures action sequences out of mundane domesticity, and transforms verbal exchanges into elaborate psychological con-games. For one scene, involving a kitchen table and near-silence, Bong seems to have exhumed the corpse of Alfred Hitchcock and drained it of every last ounce of inspiration.

In Parasite, Bong doesn't appear to be expressing empathy for the poor, like, say, Alfonso Cuaron did in Roma. Nor does he seem to be pointing fingers at the rich. He is, instead, questioning the very nature of mankind; its self-centred ingratitude and its propensity to create divisions and to resort to violence.
I have now seen Parasite twice. A third viewing has, in the meantime, been scheduled. But even a dozen repeat viewings would be inadequate to unravel its many (hidden) layers. It's the best film of 2019, by far - an almost religious experience, deserving of a pilgrimage to the theatre.

How Parasite, a non-English film, made history at Oscars 2020

Several minutes before the main, and more coveted, categories were announced at the 92nd Academy Awards 2020, it was time for the Best International Feature Film trophy. There was absolutely no doubt that Bong Joon Ho's Parasite would whisk away this one. And it did.
But when this South Korean film walked away with four trophies of the six categories it was nominated in, including Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Picture, it is perhaps necessary to take a moment and let it all sink in. This is Oscar history - the first time a non-English film won Best Picture.
READ OUR REVIEW OF PARASITE
WATCH THE TRAILER OF PARASITE
Those who have watched Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece will admit in a heartbeat that it deserved all that it got. Some might even argue that it should have won in all 6 categories or have been nominated for more. But the question - did Parasite deserve it - needs a closer look. And more importantly, an unbiased and impartial one.
Parasite is essentially the story of two families of four - the Kims and the Parks - belonging to opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum. The Kims scavenge and make do with whatever they can grab; the Parks, are affluence personified. The Kims' semi-basement apartment floods after a torrential downpour in one part of the city. In the other, the Parks import 100 per cent waterproof tents from the US for their little son, for recreation.
But, their exceedingly different worlds collide, intertwine, and entangle.
Bong Joon Ho paints a perfect picture of imperfection with the poor Kim family and presents its foil in the Parks. There's not a speck of dirt on the floor at the Park residence, while the Kims have a permanent dirt line under their nails. If this kind of genius attention to detail doesn't deserve an Oscar, we don't know what does.
When the Kims land jobs with the Parks, the film reaches its highest point of irony and makes you question, who are the parasite here? The obvious answer would be, the poor family who're using the rich and affluent Parks as the host. There are scenes that literally point you towards this obvious answer when the family of four are raiding the fridge and the bar at their employer's house in their absence and make it a night. And then there's the realisation of how the rich, in their entitlement and oblivion, take advantage of the poor.
Parasite, even though a reflection of the South Korean society, can easily be interchanged in an Indian context if you were only to imagine a Dharavi jhopdi against the bungalows of Altamount Road. In that, Parasite appeals to and identifies with the rich and poor class divide of absolutely any country in the world. If that successful transcendence doesn't deserve an Oscar, we don't know what does.
In a particular scene, when the Kims find their home flooded, the daughter surrendering to the fact that she cannot do anything to make things better crouches atop a flooding (picture bubbling) commode and lights a cigarette. The calm on her face is haunting. On the flip side, when the mother in the Park family finds out that her son might have a growth disorder, even with all the money at her disposal, has a shadow of fear eclipsing her face. If this kind of realistic portrayal of emotion doesn't deserve an Oscar, we don't know what does.
Yes, Oscars 2020 made history today. A South Korean film won Best Picture and floored us. And yes, the film deserved all that it got. Congratulations Bong Joon Ho and team. And welcome back the Academy Awards. You did well.

ABSTRACT
For anyone not yet familiar with Bong, Parasite is ready and eager to infect your consciousness and soul, quickly turning you into an eager host for all things Bong
FULL TEXT
Every week, the film industry offers a fresh slap to the face. Between the increasing dominance of mindless franchise product and the erosion of substantive films made for discerning audiences, it is difficult to feel hopeful about stepping into the dark of a cinema - as wondrous and transformative an experience as modern life affords.
But this past weekend, salvation reared its head in New York and Los Angeles, where a new film smashed box-office records. The unlikely culprit: Parasite, a small-scale South Korean drama with no special effects to speak of and zero sequel or spinoff potential to tempt skeptical audiences. Thanks to audience word-of-mouth and https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff/article-tiff-2019-from-hustlers-to-joker-to-parasite-make-way-in-the/ culled            https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/tiff/article-tiff-2019-the-globes-guide-to-movies-screening-at-the-festival/, Parasite earned an average of more than US$128,000 in each of the three theatres it screened, an unheard of figure for a foreign-language film, especially one unable to boast a high-concept narrative or internationally renowned star.
Parasite does, however, have one semi-known quantity to boast of: writer and director Bong Joon-ho. Arthouse-attuned moviegoers will recognize the name from his early Seoul-based dramas Mother and Memories of Murder, while anyone with a Netflix subscription will recall his https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/film-reviews/review-okja-an-over-the-top-blockbuster-with-a-message/article35420921/, or perhaps his politically charged sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer. But for anyone not yet familiar with Bong, Parasite is ready and eager to infect your consciousness and soul, quickly turning you into an eager host for all things Bong.
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-bong-joon-hos-parasite-is-a-four-star-polemic-sharp-enough-to-draw/            https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/film/reviews/article-whats-new-in-theatres-and-streaming-this-week-including-the-four/
Following the messy intersection of two modern Seoul families - one clan destitute and scheming for a better life, the other perched comfortably and ignorantly at the upper crust of society - Parasite is exhilarating, thrilling, furious and deeply upsetting. It is also, and here's where things get tricky, extraordinarily surprising, with its story pivoting on a huge twist that arrives one-third through. All of which is to say: Bong hopes you see Parasite, before Parasite becomes inescapable.
"Thankfully, everyone has so far been really co-operative with keeping the spoilers to themselves. I've seen families eating out in Seoul, talking about the film, but once they discover there are people among them who haven't seen it, they got up and left," says Bong, 50. "People are really protective of this film."
It is the opening weekend of the Toronto International Film Festival, and Bong seems deeply exhausted. The director has been discussing - and, well, not discussing - the implications of Parasite's twist since this past May, when the film had its world premiere at Cannes, bowling over critics and capturing the film festival's coveted Palme d'Or. Somehow, as the film has since travelled to Telluride and Toronto (where it would go on to win second runner-up for TIFF's People's Choice Award), Parasite's big reveal has been preserved, a testament to either audiences' newfound ability to keep something special to themselves in an era of instant spoiler-y Twitter tidal waves, or the sheer power that the film carries. Likely both.
"The film has been released in several countries now, and I've begun to see people diving into it as if it were a game - discussing the details, the foreshadowing of the twist, the symbolism in the film," Bong says, "but no one is spoiling it. Mostly everyone, at least in the Korean online community, are talking about poverty and their own experiences. And how it's actually worse than it seems in the movie."
And Parasite makes life on South Korea's lower rung look absolutely awful. Bong introduces the Kim family - Parasite's quasi-protagonists - as sympathetic bottom-feeders, with the foursome occupying an overcrowded basement apartment where the toilet is faulty, the WiFi must be leeched from neighbouring businesses and the air is thick with either the scent of drunkards' urine or the debilitating fog of street-level fumigation. Patriarch Kim Ki-taek (Bong regular Song Kang-ho) is desperate and clever in equal measure, but cannot seem to imagine a world even one step higher. Until, that is, his son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), sneakily scores a tutoring job for the son of wealthy tech entrepreneur Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun). Over the course of about two hours, fortunes are changed, lives are upended, and the class tensions of South Korea - or anywhere in the world, really - are stretched till they snap.
"As Korea went through the Korean War and the military dictatorships, we've become a very developed and rich country," Bong explains. "But despite the growth, the gap between the rich and the poor has only widened. As the country over all seems wealthy and extravagant, there are still so many people who are saying, 'Why are we still struggling?' That sense of inferiority and loss, it's felt. And it's not just emotional, it's physical."
In typical Bong fashion - reminiscent of how Okja's zany corporate satire comes equipped with a too-bizarre-for-words Tilda Swinton or how The Host's family melodrama is backgrounded by a good old-fashioned monster hunt - Parasite's central themes are delivered in a blessedly shocking manner. The Kim family's slow invasion of the Parks is tightly controlled dark comedy until Bong flips the story on its head to produce a shocking and sickening tragedy. As his film's title suggests - who is the real bloodsucker here, the Kims or the Parks? - Bong doesn't so much upend expectations as he dares you to forever abandon yours.
The film also marks a surprising, if perhaps inevitable, return for Bong to his home country. After spending the past half-decade working if not exactly in then explicitly for Hollywood with Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite finds Bong returning to a more familiar country and language.
"I tend to improvise a lot on set, so it's adjusting dialogue and suggesting new ideas, so it was great to not need a translator this time, and being able to have fun with my actors," Bong says. "But a lot of the joy this time came from not coming back to Korea, but to coming back to films of this size and scale. Working on Parasite was like working on Mother or Memories of Murder. Smaller, controlled, comfortable."
Part of the comfort comes from having actor Song Kang-ho around once again. Although the Korean star had a supporting role in Snowpiercer, the full weight of Parasite rests on Song's sizable shoulders - a task he carries with the dedication and commitment familiar to anyone who has seen him blaze the screen in such Korean hits as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Thirst. His Parasite patriarch, at once beaten down and invigorated by a world that wants nothing to do with him, is one of the more complex and memorable characters that audiences of any culture will encounter this year.
"It's not as if there's a special nerve on the back heel of Song's foot that's connected to my finger, but sometimes it does feel as if we have that connection," Bong says of his relationship with his frequent collaborator. "We don't talk a lot on set - we don't discuss the character for hours - but I think Song, as an actor, instinctively understands what I want to say with my script, and what we need to show with a particular scene. There's never been a time when I've disagreed with a decision in his performance."
As Parasite begins to creep further into North America - it opens in Toronto this Friday, before expanding into more Canadian theatres in November - Bong is faced with a sort of Bong-esque dilemma: Should he trust that the typical hopes for a film of his pedigree and provenance will prevail, i.e., that the film will get Academy Award attention in the Best International Film category? Or should he prepare for an upending of his own expectations, and find Parasite instead nominated in the mainstream Best Picture slot, alongside Hollywood's finest? In a tiny way, the film's fate is in his hands.
"Song and I have been members of the [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] for the past five years, now that the Academy is trying to increase the diversity of its membership. So this year, we talked about, 'Oh, should we vote for Parasite?' " Bong says with a laugh. "Is it embarrassing? Is it illegal? But anyway, it's a secret vote."
And secrets are Bong's specialty. He'll keep his, so long as you keep Parasite's.
Parasite opens Oct. 18 in Toronto.

Urvashi Rautela copies New York writer's Parasite review. At least correct the grammar, he responds

Urvashi Rautela often grabs headlines for lifting off content from various celebrities' social media accounts and she has done it again. But this time, she's picked up an entire movie review from a New York-based writer, Jaun Paul Bammer.
Needless to say, netizens have been trolling Urvashi on Twitter on account of plagiarism since then. But guess what, the writer has also reacted to the similarity between both the tweets.
Here's what happened:
Urvashi posted a review of Bong Joon Ho's Oscar-winning film Parasite yesterday (March 31) and netizens were too quick to match her tweet with the writer's, who wrote the exact words on his Twitter handle on March 3.
Urvashi wrote, "one thing I really love about @ParasiteMovie is that rather than depict the fam as scammers pretending to be good at their jobs, they actually do their jobs flawlessly! what they lack isn't skill, but institutional stamps of approval & the bows and ribbons that rich people love (sic)."
However, the tweet has been deleted now.
She also posted the same on her Instagram story.
After the Pagalpanti actress tweeted about Parasite, a collage with the screenshots of both the tweets has been doing the rounds on Twitter.
 It's no brain time. pic.twitter.com/K8wGZdHFmn Niriksh (@nirikshhhh)            March 31, 2020
The writer, who has JP as his username, noticed the collage shared by one Twitter user. He didn't take any offence, and instead wrote, "I am rooting for her."
However, in his second tweet, he pointed out how she didn't even correct the grammar on the tweet.
"Why didn't she at least correct the grammar" um my bad grammar?? is part of the vibe??? wow (sic)," the writer tweeted.
 "why didn't she at least correct the grammar" um my bad grammar?? is part of the vibe??? wow JP (@jpbrammer) March 31, 2020
Earlier this year. Urvashi copied PM Narendra Modi's tweet. PM Modi had tweeted about veteran actress Shabana Azmi's speedy recovery after she met with an accident in January and Urvashi used the same words in her tweet back then.
In 2018, Urvashi was heavily bashed for copying Gigi Hadid's statementon Instagram.
Coming back to Parasite, the film won four awards at Oscars 2020 - Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Foreign Language Film and Best Picture.

Parasite made history at Oscars this year. The film won four Oscars and became the first non-English film to bag the award for the Best Picture.
The film won in four categories. These include - Best Director, Best Film, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film. Parasite's director Bong Joon Ho got a standing ovation at the awards night and his speech also went viral.
Among many pictures and videos of Bong that are being liked by fans, one picture shows him making his two Oscars kiss. Twitter users are going crazy over Bong's this viral picture.

India, Feb. 10 -- Bong Joon Ho's Parasite made history, Brad Pitt won his first acting Oscar, Laura Dern collected best supporting actress and Joaquin Phoenix won the best actor Oscar at the 92nd Academy Awards.
Bong's South Korean class satire took four big awards: best picture, best director, best original screenplay and best international film. All were the first Oscars for a Korean film. Bong and co-writer Han Jin Won became the first Asian writers to take the screenplay prize. Parasite became the first non-English language film to win best picture.
As it has for much of awards season, Parasite appeared the favourite in the room. A standing ovation greeted Bong's win for international film. "I am ready to drink tonight," said Bong to roars from the crowd. Unexpectedly called up again for best director, Bong saluted his fellow nominees, particularly Martin Scorsese, and concluded: "Now I'm ready to drink until tomorrow."

As it did last year, the annual Dolby Theatre ceremony kicked off without a host. Janelle Monae opened the show entering a Mister Rogers set and singing A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.
"I'm so proud to be standing here as a black queer artist telling stories,' said Monae. 'Happy Black History Month."
Two former Oscar hosts, Chris Rock and Steve Martin, dropped in to supply an opening monologue. Martin called it "an incredible demotion." Martin noted that something was missing from this year's directing nominees. "Vaginas!' Rock replied.

Bong's work before 'Parasite'; Hard-core movie fans have been hip to the director for years. Here's how to get up to speed.

ABSTRACT
Hard-core movie fans have been hip to the director for years. Here's how to get up to speed.
Although some folks were surprised by Sunday's Academy Award wins for South Korean director Bong Joon Ho and his movie Parasite, you could see on Oscar night that fellow nominees Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino were not among them.
Both are movie buffs, familiar with Bong's impressive career, and clearly knew it was only a matter of time before his work was recognized on an international scale - in fact, Parasite had already won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019.
Also probably not surprised? Oscar winner Brad Pitt (best supporting actor for Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood), who produced Bong's last movie Okja, released in 2017.
Filmmakers and hard-core movie fans have been hip to Bong for years.
"Bong's other films have already received a good deal of recognition and praise from American critics and filmgoers," said Jae Won Edward Chung, assistant professor of Asian languages and cultures at Rutgers University and a Bong fan. "Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja have A-list stars like Chris Evans and Jake Gyllenhaal, and The Host (2006) got rave reviews when it was released in the States."
They're all worth checking out, he said, but for the uninitiated, he also recommends some of the director's early, lesser known work.
"Most people probably haven't heard of Barking Dogs Never Bite - a quirky black comedy about a struggling academic trying to settle a score with a neighbor's dog that won't stop yapping," he said. "It's probably still my favorite film by Bong Joon Ho. It doesn't take itself as seriously as his later works, and yet it has these wonderfully observed everyday moments that really haunt you for a long time after it's over."
If you want to see Parasite and some of the director's previous movies, here's what to expect and how to find them:
>Parasite (2019). Two Korean families, one rich and one poor, intertwine in increasingly fraught ways as members of the lowerclass family take jobs in the wealthy household. Starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, and Park Sodam. The movie is still in theaters, including the Ritz Five and Bryn Mawr Film Institute. You can also rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and You-Tube.
>Okja (2017). A Korean farm girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) lives in the mountains with a giant pig, who is removed and taken to New York, where an agribusiness CEO (Tilda Swinton) has sinister plans for the animal. The corporate agenda is undermined by animal rights activists (Paul Dano, Steven Yeun). Jake Gyllenhaal is the TV celebrity mixed up in the ensuing media frenzy. Streaming on Netflix.
>Snowpiercer (2013). Survivors of a climate-engineering disaster hurtle through a frigid future inside a train, where a revolutionary (Chris Evans) tries to disrupt the rigid class hierarchy that exists on board. With Swinton, Ed Harris, and John Hurt. Streaming on Netflix.
>Mother (2009). An extremely twisted tale of a mother (Kim Hye-ja) who will do anything for her son, and a son (Won Bin) who will do anything for mom. As we see in the director's other films, family can be murder. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Vudu, and YouTube.
>TheHost(2006). Chemicals dumped into a river produce a ravenous creature that preys upon local residents. A street vendor (Song Kang-ho) fights back when the thing abducts his daughter (Ko Ah-sung). A repertory classic that often turns up in midnight screenings and horror festivals. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and You-Tube.
>Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000). Residents of an apartment complex turn on each other when one man's irritation at a noisy dog leads to a sequence of retaliation and retribution. You can rent or buy on Amazon Apple, FandangoNow, and Vudu. gthompson@inquirer.com

How 'Parasite' Director Bong Joon Ho Created the Year's Most Dangerously Charming Film

Nov 18, 2019( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  This story first appeared in the Race Begins issue of TheWrap's Oscar magazine. Bong Joon Ho didn't know what was going to happen in 'Parasite,' either. Long before his darkly comic, deliciously twisted look at class divisions thrilled audiences and critics in Cannes and beyond, before the bends in its genre-hopping narrative befuddled and delighted adventurous moviegoers, the writer-director himself wondered where the hell this story was going. 'I let this idea develop for around four years in my head, since 2013,' Bong said. 
'But the second half of the film, all of that came in the last three months of my screenwriting process. The idea of a poor family infiltrating a rich house one by one was there since 2013, but I had many versions of the ending, and I didn't know what was going to happen. 'It all came flooding out in the last three months, like I was yanking a potato out of the earth. It was a very exciting feeling.' Before that, he added with a laugh, he did know that the film wouldn't have a conventional conclusion. 'I had a feeling that it would become a very strange story,' he said. 'I knew it would not be a normal ending.' Also Read: 'Parasite' Film Review: Bong Joon-ho Tackles Disparity With Delicious Dark Comedy[1]     And now Bong Joon Ho has the chance to experience an extraordinary ending with his film — not on screen, but off. After winning the Palme d'Or in Cannes, receiving near-unanimous critical acclaim and earning $14.4 million in its first six weeks of limited release, 'Parasite' seems likely to become the first Korean film ever to be nominated in the Best International Feature Film category (formerly Best Foreign Language Film). But beyond that, it has attracted such passionate fans that it's clearly in the running for Best Picture and Best Director nominations, which would place it in the rare company of such notable films as Alfonso Cuarón's 'Roma,' Michael Haneke's 'Amour' and Costa-Gavras' 'Z.' 'No one knows what will happen, but I am looking forward to it,' Bong said of the prospects of Oscar recognition. 'Korean cinema is celebrating its 100-year anniversary, and at one time Korean films were relatively less known in the international community compared to Japanese, Chinese and Hong Kong films. It was really in the 2000s when Korea became one of the most robust film industries in Asia. So if 'Parasite' were to be nominated, it would mean a lot for the whole Korean film industry, and give people the opportunity to reflect on the history of Korean cinema.' But 'Parasite' is no history lesson. Brash and freewheeling, with tonal shifts, forays into genre and a steadily increasing amount of craziness, it's a thrill ride that takes unexpected turns but also happens to be a trenchant examination of the gulf between rich and poor. 'I always felt like I wanted to be a step ahead of the audience,' said Bong, who acquired a reputation for skillful genre exercises with Korean films 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' before making the English-language films 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja.' 'When they're not prepared to have something explode, I would have something explode in the story. And when the audience is anxious and expecting something to happen, I would delay that moment so they would become more and more anxious. I really had to go beyond the audience's expectations in terms of where the story will go.' That story starts in the squalid basement dwelling of the Kim family, a quartet of seemingly lovable losers who get a boost when son Ki-woo lies his way into a job tutoring the teenage daughter of a rich couple, the Parks. In short order, the rest of the family worms their way into jobs with the Parks; it's a great arrangement for them, until it isn't. 'The initial concept for the story was the sense of infiltration,' said the writer-director routinely referred to as 'Director Bong.' 'When you work, you rarely have the opportunity to enter the private realm of somebody's life — but with jobs like tutoring, driving or housekeeping, you have no choice but to infiltrate their lives.' He drew from his own days tutoring a rich teenager, though you can only learn so much from a job if you get fired after two months, as Bong was. Also Read: 'Parasite' Sets New Record for Director Bong Joon-Ho at Indie Box Office[2]    The film's setup puts rich and poor characters in close proximity, which had also been a characteristic of 'Snowpiercer.' Asked if he's particularly drawn to the subject in these times of vast income disparity, he shrugged. 'You know, 'Snowpiercer' is from a French graphic novel which was created in the middle of the 1980s,' Bong said in English, before characteristically slipping into Korean midway through his answer. (Obviously, the Korean sections of his answers are translated for this story.) 'But that subject still works,' Bong said, citing recent works like Hirokazu Kore-eda's 'Shoplifters' and Jordan Peele's 'Us.' 'There is a commonality among all those films,' he said. 'It's not just me — I think a lot of creators are interested in that issue. It's something that's around us in our daily lives, and it's very close to the times that we live in — this idea of capitalism, and the gap between rich and poor.' He paused, and then returned to English for a couple of sentences. 'But a filmmaker like Ken Loach, he has already been dealing with that subject matter for a long time. I really admire him, but I haven't latched onto the issue like he did. It's not something that I plan to persistently pursue throughout my career. I consider myself primarily a genre filmmaker. I really pursue the entertainment that comes from genre, the excitement that it brings. And through those elements, I try to explore these issues.' The approach can be risky: Balancing black comedy with social drama and moments of horror takes a deft hand to keep things from sliding into messiness and tonal chaos. But the director thinks he's figured out how to do it with the help of two main factors. 'The first is the actors I work with,' he said. 'All the actors in 'Parasite,' they always retain a very realistic tone to their performances. It's never extreme, it's never fitted to the genre framework. They always show very realistic emotions. So even when the image and atmosphere of my film changes, they always maintain that realistic tone. And I think that's why the film ends up being so coherent, even when the genre atmosphere changes.' Song Kang-ho, who has acted for Bong several times and plays the father in 'Parasite,' said those tonal shifts were what concerned him the most about his work in the film. 'I thought, 'How am I going to control the transition from one genre to the next in the same movie?'' he said. 'That really kept me awake.' The second way he balanced different genres, Bong added, is by not fully committing to any one of them. 'In any one particular scene or sequence, even if it's funny, it's never 100% slapstick comedy,' he said. 'It's funny, but there's always a layer of anxiety underneath. People feel guilty about laughing, they wonder if they should even be laughing. There are already multiple layers of emotions in one scene. So even if the surface layer changes throughout, because everything is so layered and there is always an underlying current, everything connects.' Also Read: Oscars International Race 2019: Complete List of Films[3]     But walking that line between laughter and guilt isn't the only way Bong is teasing his audience. The Kim family automatically gets our sympathy at the beginning of the film: They're poor, they live in a pit (literally), they're doing their best and they're played by tremendously appealing actors, Bong veteran Song Kang-ho foremost among them. But as much as we like them, we also find ourselves coming to terms with the fact that they do horrible things to improve their fortunes. 'They are doing very bad things!' Bong agreed with a laugh. 'But it's actually very complicated and subtle. Because of the very particular charm that these actors have and the very human emotions that they portray, we as an audience end up rooting for them and we wish for their con to succeed. I think that's the dangerous charm that these actors have and that cinema has. 'But even with the rich family, they're not your conventional greedy assholes. It's not as if they're corrupt or embezzling or anything like that. So overall in this film you have no clear villains. You can have suspicion of all the characters while feeling a lot of affection for them. And that's how I felt as a filmmaker as I was shooting this film, too.' Park So-dam, who auditioned for 'Okja' but was too old for the part of the little girl in that film (she's now 28), was thrilled to land her role as the scheming daughter. 'Every moment working with him is exciting and sometimes gives me butterflies in my stomach,' she said. 'In a good way.' Bong is now working on two films, both of which are in the early stages; one is in English and the other in Korean, and they're both relatively low budget. ('Parasite' cost a little more than $10 million and he says the next two will be comparable in budget.) Given the Oscar buzz and the amount of time he's spending in the U.S. this awards season, a Hollywood movie or two would hardly be surprising — but to hear him tell it, he has no real desire to be that predictable. ''Snowpiercer' was my first English-language film, but it's not as if I intended to create a film in English,' he said. 'The original French graphic novel demanded an international cast and the story demanded that it be in English. It's not that I intend to emigrate to L.A. and continue making only English films, or stay in Korea and only make Korean films. I will just follow the ideas and materials that I'm attracted to at the time, and it's always a very natural process.' And while he does have a 'great' American agent who sends him 'really amazing' scripts, the guy just can't bring himself to be a gun for hire. 'It's a personal issue,' he said. 'As a writer and director, I can't help but be more attracted to scripts where I write everything from start to finish. I admire professional film directors who can direct scripts written by other people, and I wish I could do it. But it doesn't work out that well for me.' Below, Bong shares some of the storyboards he used to shoot 'Parasite,' compiled in the book 'Parasite: The Screenplay and Storyboard Book,' which was published in South Korea in October. 'I storyboard everything, and I do it myself,' Bong said of his process. 'I draw it on my iPad and put it on iCloud.' He paused and laughed. 'I don't know why I put in all the effort to draw this when I could hire someone to do it for me.'

'Parasite' Review: Bong Joon-ho Delivers a Brilliant and Devastating Electric Shock of Economic Anxiety

May 21, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Bong Joon-ho[1], the sui generis South Korean auteur behind unclassifiable modern wonders like 'Barking Dogs Never Bite' and 'The Host,' has always made films that refuse to fit the narrow parameters of any particular genre. Each of them is built atop a bedrock of comic violence that Bong uses to support the weight of the heavy stories he places on top of it, but simply categorizing 'Snowpiercer' as science-fiction or 'Memories of Murder' as a mystery would require you to ignore the rare magic that holds them together, and deny the controlled instability that allows them to keep changing shape before your eyes. The director refers to his furious and fiendishly well-crafted new film as a 'family tragicomedy,' but the best thing about 'Parasite[2]' is that it gives us permission to stop trying to sort his movies into any sort of pre-existing taxonomy — with 'Parasite,' Bong finally becomes a genre unto himself. Ditching the sci-fi elements that have defined his recent work in favor of a more grounded (but no less eccentric) story of life under the pall of late capitalism, Bong's latest offers another compassionate parable about how society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people. 
The difference with this tender shiv of a movie is that it doesn't rely on its metaphors, or even let them survive; on the contrary, it attacks them with a wide variety of household objects until it becomes clear just how possible all of 'Parasite' really is. As heightened as 'Okja,' but as realistic as 'Mother,' it proves once and for all that with Bong Joon-ho — as with the hyper-stratified systems that he invariably depicts — the more things change, the more they stay the same. And the more his films transform — over the course of an act, a scene, or sometimes even a single shot — the more holistic they become. Play Video[3]'Parasite' begins with its most nakedly relatable moment of leeching, as the members of a poor Seoul family scurry around their squalid, basement-level apartment looking for a few bars of free wi-fi. It seems like one of the local businesses, sick of having their network slowed down by a bunch of freeloaders, finally got around to installing a password. So it goes. 'Hold your phones high!' yells good-natured patriarch Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), as if he hasn't been rendered obsolete because of his complete lack of technological know-how. But his college-age son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam) both dutifully heed their father's advice, because their dad has been around the block a few times and they respect his life experience. Chung-soon (Chang Hyae-jin), Ki-taek's wife, focuses the brunt of her energy on folding the massive stacks of flat pizza boxes that are piled in their grimy kitchen — the pittance a local restaurant pays them for that service has become the family's only source of outcome. But, as with all of the protagonists in Bong's films, these people are smart and proud and resourceful; in a nod to Bae Doo-na's character from 'The Host,' Chung-soon even has an impressive background in esoteric sports. The problem is that they've been screwed by a system that doesn't have any mercy for those who slip down the ladder, and now they live in a cement box with no door. So when Ki-jung's handsome, higher-class friend moves to America and asks him to take over his job tutoring the teenage daughter of a nouveau riche businessman, the underqualified Ki-jung jumps at the chance. His artful sister forges up some documents, and the next thing he knows he's standing in the foyer of a spacious granite mansion somewhere in the hills above the city. The place — a marvel of set design that Bong's team constructed with all the care with which he writes his characters — is a sleek masterpiece of smooth rock and clear glass; it's wide open, but it also harbors plenty of great hiding spots. It's a fine home for the obliviously affluent Park family, even if the sweet but daffy Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) and her longtime housekeeper (Lee Jung-eun) are the only ones there to look after the kids. And both of them definitely need looking after. Da-hye (Jung Ziso) is a horny student who treats her tutors as indentured make-out partners, while little Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) is a hyper-active kid with some real trauma and a nascent artistic streak that his mom likens to Basquiat with a straight face; 'Parasite,' like all of Bong's films, is laugh-out-loud funny until the moment it's not. Lucky for the Park family, Ki-woo happens to be related to someone who could look the part of an art teacher — of course, he and his sister pretend not to know each other when she shows up for her interview. It isn't long before Ki-jung schemes to have Mr. Park's driver fired, creating another open position. The housekeeper is the only obstacle left at that point; once Chung-sook has replaced her, one family will have completely latched onto another and feeding off their financial assistance (as well as the food in their well-stocked refrigerator full of Voss water, which might be life's most succinct expression of empty wealth). One family lives above the hills, and the other lives below a flood zone; if 'Snowpiercer' was a socioeconomic hierarchy knocked sideways, 'Parasite' stacks the classes up again in a way that stretches from the sewers to the sky, and all sorts of hidden pockets in between. This movie doesn't hinge on major plot twists, per se, but the cleverness of its structure only takes shape as one clan gets more comfortable living off another, and the top and bottom rungs of the financial ladder start meeting in the same place. Thanks to cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, whose camera juts through the Park home like the bones of a skeleton, Bong's reliably clever and multi-plane compositions make that house feel like the blueprints of a world that's diced up by an invisible social contract. When Mr. Park heaps praise on his new driver for not 'crossing the line,' you can almost see the divide he's talking about. Few movies have so viscerally traced how certain jobs cause the rift between tax brackets to collapse. Ki-woo and his family share a space with the Parks, but they occupy a different reality; they (and their film) spend most of their time in that mansion, but you can feel them navigating around their employers' lives with surgical precision. Of course, cut deep enough, and those careful boundaries start to bleed. This being a Bong Joon-ho movie, that blood eventually comes out in huge splashes, and it seeps into some very unexpected places. Giddy one moment, unbearably tense the next, and always so entertaining and fine-tuned that you don't even notice when it's changing gears, 'Parasite' takes all of the beats you expect to find in a Bong film and shrinks them down with clockwork precision. The movie doesn't feel smaller than the globe-trotting 'Okja,' only more constricted. It's a magic trick that Bong is able to pull off because he's able to carve an entire breathless setpiece from a single wooden table. There's nothing in 'Parasite' as epic as the opening attack in 'The Host,' but the film contains a number of inspired sequences that pulse with the same, chaotic, morally relative madness of Bong's signature moments; one is underwater, one is on stone, one is on grass. Exciting as they are, all of them produce a heart-in-your-throat queasiness that comes with not knowing who deserves to survive. Bong has a profound empathy for Ki-woo's family, but his plot hinges on the damage their economic aspirations have on the people they displace; in order to move up in this world, someone else has to be brought down. Likewise, the Park family is never portrayed as explicitly 'bad,' even if their money has made them a little dumb and desensitized. Eschewing didacticism, 'Parasite' takes the complicated feelings that indentured workers have for their employers and conducts it into a veritable symphony of respect and contempt. It's not sustainable, but when it all breaks down it can just start over at the top of the cycle — the more things change, the more they stay the same. There's a reason why Bong's films usually end by restoring some version of the status quo, albeit with a hole in the middle (think of Song Kang-ho and his adopted son on the ice in 'The Host'). By the same token, there's a reason why 'Parasite' feels like his most crestfallen movie to date, and also his angriest. If the third act becomes a touch anticlimactic for how fast Bong stitches up some fresh wounds in order to race towards his ending, that feeling is redeemed by a massively powerful last shot that puts all of the director's work in perspective. Unlike his previous movies, which all had more readily available precedents, the hyper-kinetic anguish here only relates back to his previous movies. It clarifies a shared dream of co-existence, and the closer his characters come to making that dream a reality, the more devastating it is when everything goes off the rails or crashes down on itself. As cute as it is that the title of 'Parasite' offers a winking response to 'The Host,' it's impossible to imagine that Bong will ever have reason to make a movie called 'Symbiosis.' The impotent rage he feels about that spills into every frame of this incredible film, and leaves us all a little richer as a result.Grade: A-'Parasite' premiered in Competition at the 2019 Cannes[4] Film Festival. NEON will release it in theaters later this year.

Why Best Picture Oscar for Parasite means hope for India's Jallikattu

This generation - us - has been witness to some astounding stuff. We've gone from chunky VCR tapes to CDs to Blu Ray and now OTT, where a click of a button transports you into a bottomless cinematic universe. And that's just in case of the movies. And along with that, we also witnessed the first-ever non-English language film going on to win the Oscar for Best Picture.
When Bong Joon Ho's Parasite made history
. Now, true blue Joon Ho fans will tell you that Parasite is no Memories Of A Murder. And while that debate may rage on, it doesn't take away from the fact that Parasite opened up a door into a new world for non-English cinema. And by extension,
for Jallikattu, the Malayalam masterpiece and India's official entry into the 93rd Academy Awards
in the Best International Feature Film category.
Watch the trailer of Parasite here:
FREEING THE OSCARS 
The Oscars aren't like the Emmys where there's a separate event altogether for non-American content. The Oscars invites entries in all languages and essentially rewards excellence in cinema. Yet until 2020, this cinema needed to be in English, with non-English content being restricted to Foreign Language Film or International Feature Film categories. Parasite was also nominated for the same, and it won the same too. And then it went on to win Best Picture as well,
thus finally breaking the language barrier
. Now, art is language in itself, as it should.
Here's the trailer of Jallikattu:
STORIES THAT TRANSCEND BORDERS 
Parasite wasn't dubbed. It had subtitles, and that was enough to convey a story about class divide in South Korea to a world audience. The simple reason it managed to do that is because while being intrinsic to the South Korean societal structure, a story of haves and have-nots transcends borders. It is true for India just as much as it is true for Argentina. When the Kims and the Parks, two families on two opposite ends of the socio-economic spectrum, clashed, we got it and we didn't need elaborate language to convey it to us. The powerful screenplay - which Parasite won another Oscar for, by the way - was enough. And Parasite could very easily have been a story about India - a Dharavi jhopdi versus the bungalows of Altamount Road. Jallikattu, on the other hand, is an allegorical story about a bull raging and rampaging through a village in Kerala as the villagers try to capture it. But it's beyond just that. In Jallikattu, it is the man who is the beast, and the bull is more human than humans today are capable of being. The name does ring a bell - the traditional event, a sport of sorts intrinsic to Tamil Nadu, but that's only a metaphor. If animal cruelty is at the centre of Jallikattu, can a viewer in Spain or Mexico not be able to understand it? With or without dubbing?
A NEW HOPE
Yes, there's a long way to go for Jallikattu. First, it needs to make the shortlist and bag a nomination at the 93rd Academy Awards. But Parasite's win last year gives one hope. That once you cross that shortlist checkpoint, the world could be yours. Even if this year Jallikattu doesn't make it, Parasite has managed to inspire filmmakers from across the globe, telling stories about their countries, in their own way, that the erstwhile elusive Oscar trophy isn't so elusive anymore. We're, after all, global citizens, one film at a time. Shrunken onto a mobile screen now.

Review: 'Parasite' is a fantastic first foray into the Korean film genre

The first time I was exposed to Korean films was a glorious experience. I don't remember how old I was, but it was probably in high school when a buddy and I watched "Oldboy" for the first time. I was blown away. I had forgotten just how wide the spectrum of emotions a movie can make you feel was, and it felt like I was falling in love with movies all over again.
The second time I was exposed to Korean films, a similar feeling was elicited from me when I watched "Train to Busan." At that point, Korean movies were batting a thousand. Then, "Snowpiercer" came along - a movie I instantly fell in love with that I didn't originally realize was a Korean movie because it was in English and had many big-name western stars in it. Eventually, I learned that "Snowpiercer" was directed by Bong Joon-Ho, one of the most talented directors/writers in South Korea and, therefore, the world. He's made a lot of really well-received movies in South Korea but only a few like "Snowpiercer" and "Okja" ever managed to gain some buzz in the states.
Every South Korean movie I'd ever seen was awesome, and as a result of that, I was incredibly excited to check out Bong's latest film, "Parasite." I won't mince words; "Parasite" is the best film of 2019 that I've seen so far (although I admit I have not seen "The Lighthouse" yet), and anybody who either speaks Korean or can read English subtitles should see this movie as soon as possible.
"Parasite" is a story about two families - the Kims and the Parks. The Kim family is down on their luck. They're all unemployed and, despite how hard they try, they can't seem to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and escape their situation. One day, a friend of Kim Ki-Woo, the oldest son (portrayed by Woo-sik Choi), puts Ki-Woo in touch with a rich family in need of a tutor, the Parks. He accepts. From there, shenanigans and some stuff that I wouldn't describe as shenanigans ensue. I won't explain anymore because I thoroughly enjoyed, going into this movie, knowing absolutely nothing about the plot and I highly recommend you do as well; the originality of the plot is an essential part of the experience of watching "Parasite." It reminded me a lot of "Get Out" at first, because "Parasite" is the first film since "Get Out" that thoroughly intrigued me because of how unique its story and storytelling is.
Where "Get Out" was a thriller with a powerful message about race, "Parasite" is a thriller with a powerful message about class, and not a ham-fisted one at that either. If you've seen any of Bong's movies, you'll know that they're often centered around a critique of capitalism - and the class struggle that comes with it. "Parasite" is his most nuanced and successful critique of capitalism and a lot of that is in the directing, but mostly in the writing and performances.
One scene that really struck me showed the Kim family hiding under a table while Mr. and Mrs. Park lay on their couch snuggling. Mr. Park, unaware of Mr. Kim's presence, talks about Mr. Kim, who is in his employment as a driver, and how he's good at his job but smells like an old radish. Mr. Kim hears all of this, and we can see that this visibly upsets him. From his facial twitches alone, we get a sense for how deep a sense of shame it brings him that he stinks and can't help it because of how poor he is, and how embarrassed it made him feel to have his children hear this, too.
Another poignant scene that comes soon after showcases how the two families react to a heavy rainstorm, with the Parks being able to sit inside their warm, peaceful, above-ground house and enjoy the rain. Meanwhile, the Kims' area of town is flooded, leading them to frantically do whatever they can to preserve what items of value could be found in the semi-basement apartment they live in.
The movie doesn't portray the rich as evil or the poor as lazy - it's not that simple. The realistic depiction of the class struggle is enough to shake whatever notions of financial stability you may have thought you had before - the two families live in entirely different worlds, and yet, the only thing inherently different about them is how much money one of them has. However, the film shows that the barrier between classes is great enough that there is nothing the poor can do to escape their predicament other than fight one another for the scraps of the rich.
The directing is phenomenal: Joon-Ho did an absolutely fantastic job, and I'm not surprised at all. There are so many shots in this film where the way they're framed can really only be described as art. This movie was so incredibly aesthetically pleasing that my brain thought it was watching ASMR soap-cutting videos for two hours. The cinematography wasn't just pretty though; it was also purposeful. The ways characters were blocked alone delivered more information to the audience than the entire scripts of most movies this year. For instance, one scene that caught my attention showed Ki-Woo's sister Kim Ki-Jung (portrayed by Park So-Dam) sitting on the toilet seat of her flooded apartment, dejectedly smoking a cigarette while watching the waters rise higher and higher. This scene subtly showing her isolation and despair is a stark contrast to most other scenes featuring the Kim family - they are usually close together like sardines in their tiny apartment - showing both their poverty and their solidarity. This is yet another distinction from the Park family, who are always splayed about in their spacious home. Joon-Ho displays a near-complete mastery of the craft, and I could feel the passion he instilled into the movie in every little detail.
I thought all the performances were great, and that's all I'm really prepared to say about that. The Kim family patriarch, played by Kang-Ho Song, was especially good. Song managed to balance the stereotypical stoic patriarchal character with enough comedic tinge so that I never knew what would happen next - would he make me laugh, or would he shock me? I was told by someone from Korea that he's like the Korean equivalent of Robert DeNiro, so I guess it should probably go without saying that he's pretty good.
The one problem I have with the movie is that it was a little slow around the start of the second half. It had a really enjoyable momentum up until that part, but with a runtime of two hours and 12 minutes, I felt like there were parts in the second half that could have been edited out or condensed. The ending is explosive though - which more than makes up for the lull - but the lull is still there.
"Parasite" is a great movie. It has a strong message, a smart script, beautiful visuals and great performances. I have not seen a movie like it in a long time, and that's a shame, because it's movies like "Parasite" that make me love film. Korean movies have never let me down, and if this movie is your first foray into the genre, you will leave very happy.

Parasite made history at Oscars this year. It became the first non-English film to win Best Film in Oscar history. The film won in four categories, which include Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Film and Best International Feature Film. With four Oscars, Parasite took over the award night.
While many Bollywood celebrities are raving about the film now, Bollywood's Badshah Shah Rukh Khan reviewed the film in October last year. Parasite was released in India on January 31.
Tweeting about the film, Shah Rukh Khan had written, "Just saw Parasite the South Korean movie on my kids recommendation. What a delightfully discomforting film. A bizarre look at social status, the state of the world...and the parasitic nature of the Materialistic Hope we all feed and live off!!"

Parasite director Bong Joon Ho got a standing ovation at the Oscars 2020. Bong paid tribute to Martin Scorsese in his speech. "After winning best international feature, I thought I was done for the day and ready to relax," he joked. He went on to say, "When I was young and studying cinema there was saying that I carved deep into my heart, which is 'the most personal, is the most creative.' That quote was from our great Martin Scorsese."

Jan 30, 2020( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  A version of this story about Bong Joon Ho and #8216;Parasite#8217; first appeared in the Down to the Wire issue[1] of TheWrap's Oscar magazine. When Bong Joon Ho finished a mid-October interview and photo shoot for the cover of TheWrap's first print issue this season, he stopped on his way out of the office to meet our film team. As one-by-one they told him how much they'd loved his film #8216;Parasite,#8217; Bong broke into a sheepish grin. #8216;This is getting embarrassing,#8217; he said. 
In the three months since then, it's safe to say that Bong Joon Ho has had plenty more embarrassing moments. He and his wickedly twisted black comedy have been the hit of the awards circuit, with the director and his actors picking up famous fans from Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio to Guillermo del Toro, who hosted a starry party for the film in early January. #8216;I tend to get shy easily,#8217; Bong said through a translator a few hours after his film landed six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. #8216;Even last night at the Critics' Choice Awards, we sat next to the #8216;Joker' table, and Todd Phillips came over and said he saw #8216;Parasite' three times and felt so many things watching the movie. I could feel my face flush and turn red, I was so embarrassed. #8216;And whenever that happens, I just try to introduce other people. So I was like, #8216;Here's our editor, here's our production designer, here's the guy who built the house #8216; That's how I cope.#8217; Also Read: Bong Joon Ho Plans to Make 'Six-Hour-Long' Film For 'Parasite' HBO Limited Series[2] The director, whose previous films include #8216;The Host,#8217; #8216;Snowpiercer#8217; and #8216;Okja,#8217; has been using that coping mechanism since the film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, picked up the lion's share of critics' awards and is now the 11th non-English film to be nominated for Best Picture, and the sixth to be nominated for Best Picture and Best International Feature Film (formerly Best Foreign Language Film) in the same year. #8216;I'm particularly happy with the Best Editing and Best Production Design nominations for the film — for the film to be acknowledged for its craft and below-the-line work,#8217; he said. #8216;For Korean cinema, a lot of people in the international community only know the auteurs, the directors, but we have so many great technicians and masters working in the industry. And for the first time now, these amazing technicians are recognized.#8217; #8216;Parasite#8217; is the first Korean film ever nominated in every one of its six categories — including the international category, where voters have surprisingly ignored South Korea's acclaimed cinema until now. #8216;I knew I had hardcore fans for my films in the U.S.,#8217; he said. #8216;But the success of #8216;Parasite' has been on a different level.#8217; Also Read: 3 Reasons Why 'Parasite' Really Could Win Best Picture - And 1 Reason Why It Can't[3] The film also became the first non-English film to win the SAG ensemble award, a prize that clearly thrilled the director. So why has this been the film to break through? #8216;I don't know the answer to that,#8217; Bong said. #8216;I wish I did, because that would really help my next project. But I don't think it's ever easy to figure out the reason behind success. #8216;A lot of people say that it's a story about rich and poor, so it can easily resonate and is universal. But I don't think that's special in itself, because there have been so many films and TV shows about the same issue. Perhaps it's because of how unpredictable the narrative is, or perhaps it's because of how charming the cast is.#8217; Asked if he thinks #8216;Parasite#8217; is his best film, Bong shrugged. #8216;No, my next one is the best,#8217; he said, in English, and then paused. #8216;I hope.#8217; Also Read: 'Parasite' Film Review: Bong Joon-ho Tackles Disparity With Delicious Dark Comedy[4] As for what that next one is, Bong has set himself an April deadline to decide between the two projects — one in English, one in Korean — he was working on before Cannes. But he's also involved with Adam McKay in an HBO miniseries inspired by #8216;Parasite.#8217; #8216;I had so many hidden ideas for background stories that I couldn't fit within the two-hour narrative,#8217; he said. #8216;This project really began with my desire to create a five-hour film where I could expand and unfold these ideas. But we're still in the early stages, and there's no specific direction yet.#8217; Bong admitted that the awards-season experience has been a grind at times — #8216;If I knew it would be this tough physically, I would have run away,#8217; he said with a grin — but he said it hasn't altered what he wants to do next, or how he wants to do it. #8216;Nothing has changed since Cannes,#8217; he insisted. #8216;When I was shooting the film, I never anticipated this or aimed for this. I just did what I have done for the past 20 years. These results can happen every time, or never again at all. But I know that very simply, from now on I just have to do what I've always been doing.#8217; Read more from the Down to the Wire issue here[5].Related stories from TheWrap: The Oscars Homestretch: '1917' Is on Top as Voting Begins[6]'2020 Oscar Shorts: Documentary' Film Review: Traditionally Intense Category Wields a Slightly Lighter Touch This Year[7]Kobe Bryant Recalled at Oscar Nominees Luncheon as 'Most Excited Person in the Room' When He Was Nominated[8] [ 1]: https://view.flipdocs.com/?ID=10004691_544977 [ 2]:            https://www.thewrap.com/bong-joon-ho-parasite-hbo-limited-series/ [ 3]:            https://www.thewrap.com/3-reasons-why-parasite-really-could-win-best-picture-and-1-reason-why-it-cant/ [ 4]:            https://www.thewrap.com/parasite-film-review-bong-joon-ho-tackles-disparity-with-delicious-dark-comedy/ [ 5]:            https://view.flipdocs.com/?ID=10004691_544977 [ 6]:            https://www.thewrap.com/the-oscars-homestretch-1917-is-on-top-as-voting-begins/ [ 7]:            https://www.thewrap.com/2020-oscar-shorts-documentary-film-review-traditionally-intense-category-wields-a-slightly-lighter-touch-this-year/ [ 8]:            https://www.thewrap.com/kobe-bryant-oscar-nominees-luncheon/

Mark Ruffalo could be set to star in a HBO TV adaptation of the Oscar winning movie Parasite. 
The Avengers star is reportedly being lined up for a role according to Collider with sources claiming there “is interest on both sides of the negotiation table”. 
It is thought Ruffalo may portray Kim Ki-taek – played in the film by Song Kang-ho – the embattled patriarch of the lower-class family in focus.

It remains unclear whether the series will be a longer-form version of Bong Joon-ho’s  Korean film or if it will be a spin off in the same vein as HBO’s recent Watchmen series.

Ruffalo, is already set to appear in another HBO television project, a seven-episode drama titled I Know This Much Is True. 
Parasite dominatedthis year’s Oscars, taking home Best International Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture. It was the first South Korean movie to win an Oscar and the first non-English language film to take home Best Picture. 
In a five star review, NME described Parasite as a “darkly comic thriller” and “a modern masterpiece”. 
Meanwhile, Ruffalo recently discussed whether ‘Avengers: Endgame’ could be his last appearance in the            Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
Appearing on the Graham Norton Show, he was asked whether he could star in another edition of the popular franchise.

“I don’t know,” the actor responded, before dramatically covering his mouth. “Who knows really? It is supposed to be over and that was supposed to be the end.”

‘Parasite’ review: Bong Joon-ho’s darkly comic thriller is a modern masterpiece (yes, even with subtitles)

“Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,” Bong Joon-ho said on stage at the Golden Globes earlier this month,            as he collected the award for Best Foreign Language Film for Parasite. His latest film, a darkly comic thriller set in Seoul’s social hierarchy, might require us to steady our dwindling attention spans and read along with the story, but it’s definitely worth the effort – Parasite is nothing short of a masterpiece. 
It begins with the Kim family, folding pizza boxes to scrape a living in their bug-infested basement home in the South Korean capital. Their dirty window is level with the street and they can just about log into someone else’s wi-fi. For our protagonists, there are tiny glimmers of hope and life above ground that are kept anchored by being able to see people literally pissing on your house or having to crouch on a ledge over the toilet to get a phone signal. 
The Kims might not have much but you get the sense that they’re content with that. They find the positive in situations most would find annoying – when a blast of fumigation seeps through their open windows from the street dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) cheerily suggests they don’t close them but make the most of some free insecticide. But their fortunes begin to change when an old friend visits son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), bringing with him a scholar’s rock that is supposed to bring wealth – and an offer to take over his job as a private English tutor for a rich family. 
With a college diploma falsified by his Photoshop wiz sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam), Ki-woo heads up – up the steep streets of Seoul and up the class system to its peak. In contrast to the Kims, the Parks are very rich, as exhibited by their spotless, spacious and modernist house with its manicured lawn and floor-to-ceiling windows. Matriarch Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) always seems on-edge, even though she has little to stress about – every menial task in her life is outsourced to staff – but her failure to do any background checks on the people she hires proves fatal later in the film. Bong Joon-ho’s ‘Parasite’ has already racked up plenty of awards. Credit: Alamy
Once settled in his new job, Ki-woo concocts ways for the rest of his family to take up jobs in the Park residence, without revealing that any of them are related. Ki-jung poses as an unorthodox art therapist “with a special reputation in her field” while, after some elaborate ruses see former employees fired, Ki-taek and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) nab roles as chauffeur and housekeeper respectively. All is going swimmingly for the Kims until they take over the luxurious home while the Parks are away on a camping trip, only to receive an unexpected visitor who reveals a big secret lurking in the depths of the house. 
From then on, it’s not just Yeon-gyo who is on edge. The two factions of the working class we see in the film are embroiled in a very physical battle to rise above each other, feigning solidarity with the other before stabbing them in the back (or throwing them down the stairs). The Kims’ comfortable new life is under threat and, as torrential rain hits Seoul and the sewers are flooded, they race down hills and city staircases to save their few belongings from the now underwater apartment shows just how far they have to fall. 
Part of the brilliance of Parasite is that, while this is an ‘us vs them’ story, it doesn’t pick a side. Instead, Bong puts the flaws of both families on full display – each is as parasitical as the other, the Kims burrowing their way into the Parks’ house under false pretences and the Parks subtly exploiting the Kims while making disparaging comments about them that give themselves a sense of superiority. 
A TV spin-off of Parasite was announced earlier this month that will explore some of the movie’s “hidden stories”. That’s exactly the feeling Parasite will leave you with – no matter how many times you watch it (and it’s a film that, as its title suggests, gets under your skin and makes you itch for another viewing), there are still so many more secrets hiding in the shadows.

'Parasite' Film Review: Bong Joon-ho Tackles Disparity With Delicious Dark Comedy
The Wrap

May 21, 2019( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Cannes has always offered a home to both audacious genre filmmaking and politically engaged, social issue cinema but it's usually been an either/or proposition. Festival juries, meanwhile, have tended to celebrate one at the expense of the other. While Quentin Tarantino's 2004 jury paid honor to both offerings — awarding Park Chan-wook's 'Oldboy' the Grand Prize and Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' the Palme d'Or - most have signaled a marked preference for politically liberal, if formally conservative works like Ken Loach's 'I, Daniel Blake' in lieu of more outr offerings. 
So it will be particularly interesting to see what this year's Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu-led bunch makes of Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite,' a genre-bending dark comedy with searing class consciousness that premiered in Cannes on Tuesday. Also Read: 'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood' Film Review: A Contemplative Quentin Tarantino Still Blows the Roof Off Cannes[1] Coming back to full-on Korean language filmmaking after his less-than-wholly satisfying Hollywood dalliances 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja,' Bong delivers a stunning return to form with this newest venture, which takes bold leaps between tenors and tone, but holds together beautifully thanks to the director's unparalleled visual/spatial sophistication, and his unsparing social indictment. In a note handed out to the press, Bong asked that we not reveal too much of the film's twisting plot, so let's just say it follows two families on opposite sides of the social/financial totem pole and tracks their growing interdependence with devious curiosity. Bong's actor of choice, Song Kang-ho ('The Host,' 'Memories of Murder'), once again takes leading man duties, playing Ki-taek, paterfamilias to a downwardly mobile family of four. When his son lands a plum gig as an academic tutor for a wealthy family, Ki-taek spots a nugget of opportunity for his entire clan, setting into motion a series of series of events that will cycle through scenes of dark comedy, shocking violence and baroquely orchestrated suspense. Also Read: Cannes Report, Day 7: Big Deal for Terrence Malick, Isabelle Huppert Dazzles in 'Frankie'[2] As the film's pitch oscillates between registers, its setting remains fixed, with almost all of the action limited to the wealthy family's sprawling estate. The house's wood paneling and open spaces offer the filmmaker an architecturally modernist playground that he exploits to great effect, most notably by creating spatial contrasts with the poorer family's cramped slum quarters. Indeed, in tracing the ocean of disparity between the two clans, 'Parasite' feels very much in concert with last year's Palme d'Or winner, 'Shoplifters,' and this year's contender, 'Sorry We Missed You.' Though the film operates along certain thriller codes and actively seeks to entertain, it has no less fiery political charge than either of those aforementioned films — and that's what makes it such a fascinating challenge with the entrenched sensibilities that have marked Cannes for so long. There is this sense that a filmmaker can only explore pernicious social issues with stylistic sobriety, and Bong is having none of that. His is a style drunk on the joys of cinema, full of fluid camera work, polished images and belly laughs. He's unafraid to take big swings in every which direction, and because he's such a skilled director, those swings almost always connect. An ambitious and delightfully accomplished work, 'Parasite' makes good on the Cannes Film Festival's promise to present the finest of world cinema. Whether this year's jury agrees, on the other, remains to be seen.Related stories from TheWrap: Cannes Struggles for Relevance in Shrinking Movie Business[3]New Database to Hire Women in Film Launches at Cannes[4]Cannes at the Halfway Point: How Did Elton John Become King of the Fest?[5] [ 1]: https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-film-review-a-contemplative-quentin-tarantino-still-blows-the-roof-off-cannes/ [ 2]:            https://www.thewrap.com/cannes-report-day-7-isabelle-huppert-dazzles-in-ira-sachs-frankie-dardennes-young-ahmed-divides/ [ 3]:            https://www.thewrap.com/cannes-struggles-for-relevance-in-shrinking-movie-business/ [ 4]:            https://www.thewrap.com/members/2019/05/20/new-database-to-hire-women-in-film-launches-at-cannes/ [ 5]:            https://www.thewrap.com/cannes-halfway-point-how-did-elton-john-become-king-of-the-fest/

SCREEN TIME; It's time to let Bong infect your comfortable little world; Word-of-mouth raves for Parasite could make South Korean director a household name in North America

Every week, the film industry offers a fresh slap to the face.
Between the increasing dominance of mindless franchise product and the erosion of substantive films made for discerning audiences, it is difficult to feel hopeful about stepping into the dark of a cinema - as wondrous and transformative an experience as modern life affords.
But this past weekend, salvation reared its head in New York and Los Angeles, where a new film smashed box-office records.
The unlikely culprit: Parasite, a small-scale South Korean drama with no special effects to speak of and zero sequel or spinoff potential to tempt skeptical audiences.
Thanks to audience word-ofmouth and rapturous reviews culled from the film-festival circuit, Parasite earned an average of more than US$128,000 in each of the three theatres it screened, an unheard of figure for a foreignlanguage film, especially one unable to boast a high-concept narrative or internationally renowned star.
Parasite does, however, have one semi-known quantity to boast of: writer and director Bong Joon-ho. Art-house-attuned moviegoers will recognize the name from his early Seoul-based dramas Mother and Memories of Murder, while anyone with a Netflix subscription will recall his genrecrossing satire Okja, or perhaps his politically charged sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer. But for anyone not yet familiar with Bong, Parasite is ready and eager to infect your consciousness and soul, quickly turning you into an eager host for all things Bong.
Following the messy intersection of two modern Seoul families - one clan destitute and scheming for a better life, the other perched comfortably and ignorantly at the upper crust of society - Parasite is exhilarating, thrilling, furious and deeply upsetting. It is also, and here's where things get tricky, extraordinarily surprising, with its story pivoting on a huge twist that arrives one-third through. All of which is to say: Bong hopes you see Parasite, before Parasite becomes inescapable.
"Thankfully, everyone has so far been really co-operative with keeping the spoilers to themselves. I've seen families eating out in Seoul, talking about the film, but once they discover there are people among them who haven't seen it, they got up and left," says Bong, 50. "People are really protective of this film."
It is the opening weekend of the Toronto International Film Festival, and Bong seems deeply exhausted. The director has been discussing - and, well, not discussing - the implications of Parasite's twist since this past May, when the film had its world premiere at Cannes, bowling over critics and capturing the film festival's coveted Palme d'Or. Somehow, as the film has since travelled to Telluride and Toronto (where it would go on to win second runner-up for TIFF's People's Choice Award), Parasite's big reveal has been preserved, a testament to either audiences' newfound ability to keep something special to themselves in an era of instant spoiler-y Twitter tidal waves, or the sheer power that the film carries. Likely both.
"The film has been released in several countries now, and I've begun to see people diving into it as if it were a game - discussing the details, the foreshadowing of the twist, the symbolism in the film," Bong says, "but no one is spoiling it. Mostly everyone, at least in the Korean online community, are talking about poverty and their own experiences. And how it's actually worse than it seems in the movie."
And Parasite makes life on South Korea's lower rung look absolutely awful. Bong introduces the Kim family - Parasite's quasiprotagonists - as sympathetic bottom-feeders, with the foursome occupying an overcrowded basement apartment where the toilet is faulty, the WiFi must be leeched from neighbouring businesses and the air is thick with either the scent of drunkards' urine or the debilitating fog of streetlevel fumigation. Patriarch Kim Ki-taek (Bong regular Song Kangho) is desperate and clever in equal measure, but cannot seem to imagine a world even one step higher. Until, that is, his son, Kiwoo (Choi Woo-sik), sneakily scores a tutoring job for the son of wealthy tech entrepreneur Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun). Over the course of about two hours, fortunes are changed, lives are upended, and the class tensions of South Korea - or anywhere in the world, really - are stretched till they snap.
"As Korea went through the Korean War and the military dictatorships, we've become a very developed and rich country," Bong explains. "But despite the growth, the gap between the rich and the poor has only widened.
As the country over all seems wealthy and extravagant, there are still so many people who are saying, 'Why are we still struggling?' That sense of inferiority and loss, it's felt. And it's not just emotional, it's physical."
In typical Bong fashion - reminiscent of how Okja's zany corporate satire comes equipped with a too-bizarre-for-words Tilda Swinton, or how The Host's family melodrama is backgrounded by a good old-fashioned monster hunt - Parasite's central themes are delivered in a blessedly shocking manner. The Kim family's slow invasion of the Parks is tightly controlled dark comedy until Bong flips the story on its head to produce a shocking and sickening tragedy. As his film's title suggests - who is the real bloodsucker here, the Kims or the Parks? - Bong doesn't so much upend expectations as he dares you to forever abandon yours.
The film also marks a surprising, if perhaps inevitable, return for Bong to his home country. After spending the past half-decade working if not exactly in then explicitly for Hollywood with Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite finds Bong returning to a more familiar country and language.
"I tend to improvise a lot on set, so it's adjusting dialogue and suggesting new ideas, so it was great to not need a translator this time, and being able to have fun with my actors," Bong says. "But a lot of the joy this time came from not coming back to Korea, but to coming back to films of this size and scale. Working on Parasite was like working on Mother or Memories of Murder. Smaller, controlled, comfortable."
Part of the comfort comes from having actor Song Kang-ho around once again. Although the Korean star had a supporting role in Snowpiercer, the full weight of Parasite rests on Song's sizable shoulders - a task he carries with the dedication and commitment familiar to anyone who has seen him blaze the screen in such Korean hits as Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Thirst. His Parasite patriarch, at once beaten down and invigorated by a world that wants nothing to do with him, is one of the more complex and memorable characters that audiences of any culture will encounter this year.
"It's not as if there's a special nerve on the back heel of Song's foot that's connected to my finger, but sometimes it does feel as if we have that connection," Bong says of his relationship with the actor.
"We don't talk a lot on set - we don't discuss the character for hours - but I think Song, as an actor, instinctively understands what I want to say with my script, and what we need to show with a particular scene. There's never been a time when I've disagreed with a decision in his performance."
As Parasite begins to creep further into North America - it opens in Toronto this Friday, before expanding into more Canadian theatres in November - Bong is faced with a sort of Bong-esque dilemma: Should he trust that the typical hopes for a film of his pedigree and provenance will prevail, i.e., that the film will get Academy Award attention in the Best International Film category? Or should he prepare for an upending of his own expectations, and find Parasite instead nominated in the mainstream Best Picture slot, alongside Hollywood's finest? In a tiny way, the film's fate is in his hands.
"Song and I have been members of the [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] for the past five years, now that the Academy is trying to increase the diversity of its membership. So this year, we talked about, 'Oh, should we vote for Parasite?' " Bong says with a laugh. "Is it embarrassing?
Is it illegal? But anyway, it's a secret vote."
And secrets are Bong's specialty. He'll keep his, so long as you keep Parasite's.

As 'Parasite' Oscar Buzz Soars, Bong Joon-ho Stays Resistant to Hollywood Offers

Sep 13, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Bong Joon-ho[1]'s 'Parasite[2]' won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May but still managed to be the talk of the fall film festivals despite competing against an onslaught of world premieres. Anyone at Telluride or TIFF[3] will tell you that the 'Parasite' screenings were some of the most attended and most raved about, leaving the family thriller with strong Oscar buzz ahead of its October theatrical release. 'Parasite' is so beloved that talks of an English-language remake[4] are already underway, but don't except Bong to personally take 'Parasite' to Hollywood. 
Speaking to IndieWire's Anne Thompson at TIFF, Bong stressed that he remains somewhat resistant to taking on Hollywood studio offers. The only way Bong would join a major Hollywood studio is if he wrote the movie himself, which most likely takes him out of the running for a majority of Hollywood franchise films. Bong cited Quentin Tarantino as a filmmaker he is modeling his career after because his intention is to only direct scripts he writes himself. When Hollywood script offers have come knocking in the past, Bong has politely turned them all down. 'I received a lot of [Hollywood] offers after 'The Host' in 2006,' Bong said. 'Lots of science-fiction, horror, and action films. I was just like, 'Wow, a Hollywood script!' I didn't accept any of them. My agent is a very nice guy and they already know that I like to direct my own scripts like Quentin Tarantino. Sometimes I do get a little disappointed that he doesn't send me anything. He doesn't send me any scripts now knowing that I always write my own.' Bong has made English-language movies in the past with 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja,' both of which were original scripts (though 'Snowpiercer' was adapted from a French graphic novel) that were picked up for U.S. distribution by studios outside of the majors at the time. 'Snowpiercer' was bought by The Weinstein Company (which led to some much-publicized[5] release issues), while Bong's 'Okja' script caught the eye of Netflix and was produced by Plan B Entertainment. These would be the kinds of movies Bong is interested in making at a major Hollywood studio, but pre-existing franchise and tentpole scripts won't do the trick. Bong made history at Cannes this year as 'Parasite' is the first South Korean movie to win the Palme d'Or. If 'Parasite' earns an Oscar nomination for Best International Film (the new name for the Best Foreign Language Film category), then it will become the first South Korean film nominated in history. U.S. distributor Neon is hoping for more than just a Best International Film nomination and is set to campaign 'Parasite' for Best Picture, Best Director, and more. 'Roma' proved last year that foreign films can break out of the international category with the right acclaim and momentum ('Roma' was nominated for 10 Oscars), and that's certainly what Neon is hoping for 'Parasite' this awards season. 'Parasite' opens in U.S. theaters beginning October 11.

Oct 11, 2019( 411mania.com: http://411mania.com Delivered by Newstex)  Directed By: Bong Joon-ho Written By: Bong Joon-ho, Han Jin-won Runtime: 132 minutes MPAA Rating: Rated R  Choi Woo-sik - Kim Ki-woo Kang-ho Song - Kim Ki-taek Park So-dam - Kim Ki-jung Jang Hye-jin - Kim Chong-sook Jo Yeo-jeong - Park Yeon-kyo Jung Ziso - Park Da-Hye Lee Sun-kyun - Park Dong-ik Jung Hyun-jun - Park Da-song Lee Jeong-eun - Moon-gwang Park Seo-joon - Min The latest film for Snowpiercer director[1] Bong Joon-ho, Parasite, might very well be his best film to date. Parasite is a thought-provoking film that's part dark comedy, part family drama and part thriller. It's not really a singular genre film, but all these elements compliment each other to deliver a surprisingly intense and shocking cinematic experience.  Meet the Kim family. 
They are a hard luck, destitute family of four. Living in an impoverished basement in a South Korean slum, they are forced to glum off of other people's WiFi networks and take menial side jobs folding pizza boxes to bring in a pittance of money. The family's eldest son Ki-woo (Choi) failed to make it into university, but what he lacks in book smarts, he makes up for in street smarts. He's a natural con artist and has the gift of gab. However, an opportunity soon falls into Ki-woo's lap in the form of a job recommendation. His best friend Min (Park Seo-joon) is traveling abroad and wants Ki-woo to take over tutoring one of his well-to-do teen students, Park Da-hye (Jung). Min-Hyuk has a romantic interest in the high-school sophomore Da-Hye, and basically wants Ki-woo to watch over her and keep away potential suitors while he's abroad. His master plan is to start dating Da-hye when she enters university. Min-Hyuk having trust in a scam artist like Ki-woo was probably the biggest mistake in his life. With the help of his sister Ki-jung's (Park So-dam) exceptional forgery skills, Ki-woo is easily able to manipulate himself into the rich, well-to-do Park household as the new English tutor for Da-hye. Da-hye's mother, Mrs. Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), is a flighty, snooty simp. She makes for an easy mark for the Kim family to assert themselves into the lives of the Park homestead.  After Ki-woo hatches a master plan, he's able to manipulate Ki-jung into the Park home as the art tutor for for the Park's youngest child, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Next up, the kids trick the Park family patriarch, (Lee Sun-kyun), to fire his driver and hire their dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). After that, it's the family housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun), who gets ousted and replaced by the Kim kids' mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). However, Ki-woo's carefully layered plan is nothing more than a house of cards, and a dark secret within the Park household threatens to shatter the Kim's ticket to money and luxury.  Parasite is a brilliantly shot movie. It's very much a product of its country of origin. As a result, it has a style that is both unique and refreshing compared to Hollywood films. It's darkly comedic, but it's not exactly an irreverent comedy. Other times, the film is darkly tragic and surprisingly poignant.  The lengths to which the Kim family goes to con and manipulate the Park family are both shocking and at times, borderline detestable. The one thing that keeps the Kim family from being outright unlikable is that there is still a true familial bond between them. The Kim family is made up down-and-out scoundrels, and yet, they still love, respect, and appreciate each other. Meanwhile, the white-collar Park family members are more self-obsessed with their status, image and wealth. If anything, it appears their wealth and status has made them soft and gullible. There doesn't appear to be any genuine love between them. It's evidence that while material wealthy might bring certain comforts and convenience, it doesn't bring true love or happiness. The Parks look down at others of a lower social standing.  This is a remarkable film about the rich vs. the poor and the dynamics therein. While the Parks are generally the protagonists of the story, they are not good people. One imagines if Ki-woo, who comes off as quite brilliant, would likely be better served investing those talents into more legitimate pursuits. His sister Ki-jung is equally brilliant and clearly a gifted graphic artist. It's bizarre these two couldn't apply themselves in school or make it into university. Perhaps that's either a flaw in the storytelling or a commentary on the South Korean academic system.  The performances in the main cast are impeccably performed. Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek really steals the show with some surprisingly dramatic and bittersweet moments. While Ki-woo is the basic protagonist of Parasite, Ki-taek is really the heart and soul of what this movie is about. The second and third act features plot twists that are both surprising and shockingly satisfying. They are twists the audience will not see coming, but they make complete and total sense. Those are the best kind of cinematic 'gotcha' moments. Bong Joon-ho and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo construct some beautiful imagery. The film is wonderfully shot. The shots are very straightforward, crisp and clear but contain all sorts of compelling imagery within them. The third act also features some quick, surprising, shocking bits of violence and gore that are rather Tarantino-esque. Parasite pulls no punches in terms of its visuals or narratives.  While many are throwing around the word masterpiece for this film, it might be premature to call it that. Bong Joon-ho has easily surpassed his previous work in Snowpiercer and created something that's both darkly humorous, compelling, dramatic, poignant and bittersweet all the at the same time. Parasite is a true cinematic experience[2] that will leave the audience with a lot to chew during the ride home.

"Parasite" perfects cinematic social commentary

Last year, if you told Academy members that Bong Joon-ho would be a frontrunner for the Oscars' esteemed Best Director prize, nine out of ten of them wouldn't know who you were talking about. The director's films have long been overlooked in the United States, despite the fact that his most recent two movies have been high-profile American coproductions (2013's "Snowpiercer" and 2017's "Okja"). But the hypothetical 10th Academy member would be completely unsurprised by the filmmaker's success, as Bong Joon-ho has been one of South Korea's most consistent directors, creating modern classics such as "Mother" and "The Host" for the better part of the last two decades.
In many ways, his journey reflects that of last year's Best Director-winner, Alfonso Cuarón - both filmmakers rose to prominence in their respective home countries, then found solid success in the United States working with American actors in English-language movies, before finally returning home to create their magnum opus in their native tongue. For Cuarón, it was "Roma," and now, for Bong, it's the incredible "Parasite."
Bong's newest film has been met with universal critical acclaim, with many writers hailing it as the best movie of the year, and one of the best of the decade. "Parasite" is completely deserving of this praise, and yet, it's difficult to describe its greatness without spoiling essential elements of its plot. The film will be best enjoyed by viewing it with as little knowledge as possible - even assigning the film a genre could do it a disservice. Rest assured, though: the remainder of this review will attempt to praise "Parasite" without revealing any of the plot's specificities.
The greatest strength of "Parasite" is its airtight screenplay - it's complex, but never confusing. The script is so meticulously crafted that every line of dialogue is essential, and not a single second of screen time could be removed without damaging the overall cohesion of the film. Bong ensures that every detail is important, as he gracefully introduces each piece of the narrative's complex puzzle without ever making it obvious that he's doing so. Seemingly extraneous conversations and characters become unpredictably prominent, and the script's attention to detail will hugely reward repeat viewings.
Yet the screenplay's efficiency doesn't hinder its thematic substance or emotional complexity. "Parasite" explores the brokenness of society with incredible nuance - it thoroughly examines socioeconomic conflict without idolizing or villainizing any particular group, and points out social issues without overtly committing to partisan politics. Viewers can completely understand every character's actions, even if they're morally reprehensible, because they all make sense within each character's particular context. Because of this dynamic contextualization, "Parasite" lacks straightforward heroes and villains, and instead features numerous well-rounded characters whose understandable motivations bring them into conflict with one another.
The cinematography, set design, and editing work hand-in-hand to juxtapose different lifestyles and effortlessly put the viewers in each character's shoes. When a character struggles, the film utilizes tight framing, claustrophobic settings, and frenzied cuts to enhance the sense of anxiety, while calmer scenes employ wider shots, larger spaces, and longer takes to allow the characters and viewers to catch their breath.
"Parasite" has two possible fates this awards season: it will either receive a plethora of nominations, or it will be the singular movie that everybody online complains about being snubbed. It's simultaneously a riveting social commentary and a thrilling piece of entertainment, and is universally accessible - while mature and occasionally graphic, any viewer of any age will be able to appreciate its quality.

 Au revoir!  
And Bong is whisked away from the press conference, and hopefully towards a bloody big victory party. 
With that, we're off too. Congratulations to Bong Joon-ho and all the winners at the 2019 Cannes film festival. And thanks to everyone who followed events at home. See you next year.

Someone asks Bong about how he comes up with his ideas.
"I write my scripts in the corner of a cafe and listen to the noises of people," he says. "That stimulates me."

A Deadline journo spices up an otherwise placid press conference by asking about a reference to North Korea in the film.
"In fact in the film you see a character who tries to imitate a North Korean presenter," Bong says. "You shouldn't construe it as a message against North Korea. It's just a small joke. Also there are a lot of comics in South Korea who make sketches on these topics. It's common in South Korea.
"I think if North Koreans see my film one day, I think they will laugh," he adds.

Bong says that Inarritu told him that "all the members of the jury unanimously agreed to give the Palme to Parasite." 
A real seal of approval, that, as in the past Cannes juries have struggled to come to unanimous decisions.

The man of the hour is here for his victor's press conference.
Interviewer Henri Behar opens by noting that Bong's win is a "historic moment" because he's the first Korean winner of the Palme.
Bong is asked what he would like to say to young directors in Korea. He replies that, "It's the 100th anniversary of cinema in Korea this year. I think that Cannes has given Korean cinema a great gift" by giving him the Palme.

Beecham, by the way, is the first Brit to win best actress at Cannes since Kathy Burke for Nil By Mouth in 1997. At the time Burke was the third British winner in three years (after Helen Mirren and Brenda Blethyn), and we assumed that the sun would never set on our acting triumphs at Cannes. Then, presumably, they stopped giving us them to punish us for our hubris.

And with that she's off

Beecham is asked why she isn't a fan of flowers, a nod presumably to her encounter with the nefarious plant from her film.

More praise for Pedro from Banderas. He says that, "the award is for the character I played, and that is the alter-ego of Pedro Almodovar. There is something of him here."
Plenty of people here thought that Almodóvar would finally win the Palme tonight. He hasn't but Banderas's win will be some solace.

So, another year without a female winner of the Palme d'Or, though there were individual prizes elsewhere for two of the four women directors appearing in competition. Céline Sciamma took home both the Queer Palm and the screenwriting prize for her luscious period drama Portrait of a Lady on Fire, while Mati Diop - on her Cannes debut, no less - took home the second biggest prize of the night, the Grand Prix.
Still one female Palme winner in 72 editions of the Cannes film festival remains a pretty striking statistic, and though Iñárritu is right to say that the decision to award the Palme must be made based on the films themselves, Cannes could perhaps give its jurors a few more directed by women to choose from: there were just 4 of 21 in this year's official selection. 
block-time published-time 8.36pm BST 
The press conferences are still rumbling on. We're now hearing from the Dardennes, who won the best director prize for their film Young Ahmed. It's an intriguing shift in direction from the pair - following a young Muslim schoolboy who is lured into extremism. "Our character excludes everybody who isn't as pure as he is," they say.
block-time published-time 8.27pm BST 
 Big night for Beecham  
While the lone British film in competition, Ken Loach's Sorry We Missed You, went home empty handed, there was a winner from these shores in the form of Little Joe star Emily Beecham. Viewers might have caught Beecham in the homegrown drama Daphne, where she played a self-destructive thirtysomething in the Fleabag mode. 
She also appeared in the slightly grim post-apocalyptic drama Into the Badlands, which I must concede I haven't seen but which the Guardian described as " absolutely bonkers... there is nothing else like it on television".
Anyway, this Cannes win is a big moment for an actor on the rise, and hopefully we'll see more of her soon.
block-time published-time 8.16pm BST 
The question readers at home are surely asking is 'when can I see Parasite?' Unlike Okja, Bong's new one won't be appearing on Netflix (and if it was it would have been excluded from the Cannes competition due to the festival's frosty relationship with the streaming giant).
Fear not though, Curzon have picked up UK and Ireland rights with a release date to be confirmed soon. Neon, meanwhile, have nabbed the North American rights with US and Canada release dates also still to be confirmed. 
Given that the film will surely be put forward as Korea's foreign language Oscar pick, you'd expect at least a US release date this year in order to meet Oscar qualification rules.
block-time published-time 8.07pm BST 
Peter Bradshaw has penned a reaction piece to this year's awards. He reckons Bong was a worthy winner, even if he was ever-so-slightly less enthusiastic about Parasite than other critics:
Korean film-maker Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is a gripping satirical parable of class, status and injustice - an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers that was widely compared to the Joseph Losey classic The Servant.
It is a handsomely made film, which runs as smoothly as a luxury car. I myself found myself thinking that I liked it a fraction less than Bong's other films, and other films in this Competition, but there is no doubt that it is an outstanding film.

Les Misérables is a French social-realist drama from first-time director Ladj Ly, while Bacurau is a truly wild sci-fi-slash-horror-slash-western from joint directors Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles. So not two but three directors sharing this one.

 Jury Prize  
Michael Moore hosting this one. He dabbles in a little French, before taking aim at - yep - Donald Trump. He's calling for film-makers to rise up and create "art in dark times", while also nodding to Pablo Picasso.
And the winner is... Les Misérables and Bacurau, jointly!

 The rest  
On the past two occasions that I've been behind the wheel of this 'ere liveblog, I've failed to give the eventual winner even a passing mention (sorry The Square and Shoplifters). To insure myself against a similar embarrassment happening this time around, here's a quick run-down of the remaining 15 films in selection: 
 Bacarau ( dir: Kleber Mendonça Filho & Juliano Dornelles ) Brazilian horror-western taking aim at Bolsonaro. In with a shout of a prize, perhaps even the Palme. Review
 T he Dead Don't Die ( dir: Jim Jarmusch ) The fest's opening night film, Jarmusch's zom-com has largely been forgotten by now. Review
 Frankie ( dir: Ira Sachs ) A Huppert-starring comedy of manners that feels a tad too slight for consideration. Review
 La Gomera  ( dir: Corneliu Porumboiu ) Fun Romanian thriller where crims communicate through whistles. Screenplay prize perhaps. Review
 A Hidden Life ( dir: Terrence Malick ) Minor return to form for Malick. Maybe not enough for the Palme, but best director a possibility. Review
    Terence Malick's A Hidden Life. Photograph: Reiner Bajo   
 It Must Be Heaven ( dir: Elia Suleiman ) The Palestinian director's self-referential satire isn't without its fans, though perhaps doesn't hit previous peaks. Review
 Les Misérables ( dir: Ladj Ly ) Drama about social unrest in a Paris suburb from first-time director Ly. Timely, which may help in the awards stakes. Review
 Little Joe  ( dir: Jessica Hausner ) Critics were unmoved by Hausner's chilly sci-fi parable. Might the jury be more supportive? Review
 Matthias and Maxime ( dir: Xavier Dolan ) One of the better recent efforts from former wunderkind Dolan, though struggles to stand out in a strong year. Review
 Oh Mercy! ( dir: Arnaud Desplechin ) A rather muted response for the Cannes veteran's cop thriller doesn't bode well. Review
 Sibyl ( dir: Justine Triet ) Fun psychodrama about a flawed therapist. Not the sort of film that often gets rewarded here, but Virginie Efira a dark horse for the actress prize Review
    Sorry We Missed You, directed by Ken Loach. Photograph: PR   
 Sorry We Missed You (dir: Ken Loach) Loach can become the triple Palme winner if he triumphs here, but this stirring social drama's similarities to I, Daniel Blake may count against it. Review
 The Traitor (dir: Marco Bellocchio) Distinctly trad mob drama from the Italian veteran. Nicely put-together, but perhaps lacks the shock of the new. Review
 The Wild Goose Lake ( dir: Diao Yinan ) Chinese mob drama where someone gets run through with an umbrella. Too pulpy for the Palme? Review
 The Young Ahmed (dir: Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne) Like Loach, the Dardennes can become three-time winners, but their extremist drama was slightly limply received. Review

 You're all winners!  
We know about the Palme d'Or, of course, but there are a number of other awards up for grabs, in the main ceremony, including the Grand Prix prize (which essentially acts as a silver medal) and the Jury prize (which is the equivalent of bronze), plus best actor, actress, screenplay and director prizes. 
Note: if a film picks up one of those prizes, it's highly unlikely to win the Palme, due to Cannes' unwritten policy of not giving multiple awards to the same film (though sometimes multiple smaller prizes are handed out, as was the case with Lynne Ramsay winning best director and Joaquin Phoenix claiming best actor for You Were Never Really Here in 2017).
Meanwhile, a load of other prizes have already been dished out. The winner of the Un Certain Regard sidebar was claimed by Brazilian 50s-set drama Invisible Life of Eurídice Gusmão, while The Queer Palm for best LGBT film went, as expected, to Portrait of a Lady on Fire.

Elsewhere, the International Federation of Film Critics (Fipresci) prize for best first or second feature has gone to Robert Eggers' The Lighthouse, an absolute firecracker of a film starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe as warring lighthouse-keepers, which Peter Bradshaw likened to "Steptoe and Son in hell" in his five-star review.
Last but certainly not least, the winner of the Palm Dog went to Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood's pitbull Brandy. Quentin Tarantino claimed the prize - a dog collar - for himself at the awards ceremony, a move that went down badly with the assembled audience! Oh, Quentin - let's hope that's not the only prize you go home with.
block-time updated-timeUpdated at 5.46pm BST

One film that surely won't win anything tonight is Abdellatif Kechiche's Mektoub My Love: Intermezzo. A sequel to the Blue is the Warmest Colour director's hedonist opus Mektoub My Love: Canto Uno, Intermezzo has received a critical savaging for essentially being a three-and-a-half-hour-long leer at young women's backsides. It's currently got a            zero percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes - ouch!

 The contenders  
So then, who's claiming the big ice cube with the decorative twig glued to its front? As has been the case in recent years, it looks an open race for the Palme with plenty of worthy candidates. Here though are five that we reckon are frontrunners:
    A Palme for Pedro? Pain and Glory. Photograph: PR   
 Pain and Glory ( Dir Pedro Almodóvar ) Despite appearing in competition five times previously, the Spanish director has never taken home the Palme, so a sense of him being overdue might influence the jury's decision here. The work itself, a deeply felt rumination on life, ageing and film-making that shares similarities with Fellini's 8 1/2, is likely to push their buttons too. Read Peter Bradshaw's review
 Portrait of a Lady on Fire ( Dir Céline Sciamma ) Again, the weight of history might play a part here: only one female director, Jane Campion, has ever won Cannes' top prize - and even then she had to share it with Farewell My Concubine director Chen Kaige. Moreover, Sciamma's 18th-century-set romance is arguably the strongest film in the entire competition. Expect an outcry if it doesn't win something major here. Read Peter Bradshaw's review
    Very much in the running... Parasite. Photograph: 2019 CJ ENM Corporation, Barunson E&A   
 Parasite ( Dir Bong Joon-ho ) Like Portrait..., this dizzying South Korean drama from the director of Snowpiercer and Okja has been received rapturously by audiences. And with good reason - it's a terrifically tense thriller with much to say about inequality and capitalism's clammy hold over society. I do slightly wonder whether the film's genre elements might hold it back, but it definitely is in the running. Read Peter Bradshaw's review
 Atlantique ( Dir Mati Diop ) The first black female director to ever appear in competition at Cannes, Diop has generated much buzz with her thoughtful, inventive drama about Senegalese migrants. It features a supernatural tinge that hasn't gone down well with everyone, but if the jury was looking to make a statement with their Palme pick, this might just be the best bet. Read Peter Bradshaw's review
    Leonardo DiCaprio in Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. Photograph: Andrew Cooper/Allstar/COLUMBIA PICTURES CORPORATION   
 Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood ( Dir Quentin Tarantino ) Tarantino's return to Cannes went more swimmingly than many expected, given that his latest tackles the tricky subject of the Manson murders. In the event, this ode to the last knockings of the old studio system might just be Tarantino's best work since the first Kill Bill, even if the film's third act left some cold. Might longstanding affection for QT push him over the top here? Read Peter Bradshaw's review

 Bonsoir!  
... and welcome to the Guardian's Cannes film festival awards liveblog. After a fortnight spent worshipping at the altar of 'le cinema' we're finally ready to find out which of 21 films will be awarded prestige film-making's most important prize, the Palme d'Or. It looks set to be an interesting race this year, with some big-hitting auteurs, including Quentin Tarantino and Pedro Almodóvar, facing off against cinema's coming forces, like Bong Joon-ho and Céline Sciamma.
We'll have the results as they happen, as well as those for the other awards being handed out this evening. The ceremony begins at 7.15pm local time (6.15pm in the UK), so stick with us for news, a little bit of insight, and - most crucially of all - the recipient of this year's 'Palm Dog'.

Dec 27, 2019( The Business Insider: http://www.businessinsider.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke On Christmas Eve, a Twitter user asked Elon Musk what his favorite film of 2019 was. Musk said his favorite film of this year was South Korean thriller "Parasite." He also said his favorite Netflix series is "Black Mirror."

But in 2019 the film that most captured Musk's imagination was the critically acclaimed "Parasite," as Musk revealed on Twitter on Christmas Eve[2].Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1209623244208312326?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw Parasite "Parasite" is a South Korean satirical thriller[3] written and directed by Bong Joon-Ho. The plot revolves about members of a poor family inserting themselves into the life of a rich one. Slate[4] compared the film to Jordan Peele's "Us." The film won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, and is tipped for an Oscar[5].

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine? On February 9, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite will be the first Korean film to ever compete for an Academy Award. In a history-making sweep on January 13, it received six Oscar nominations, including one in the prestigious Best Picture category. Last Sunday, the Screen Actors Guild gav e Parasite's acting ensemble its top award[3] for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, selecting it above the legendary lineups for The Irishman, Bombshell, Jojo Rabbit, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Ad Policy[4] For Bong, Parasite's manic and innovative director, it was overdue recognition. His brilliant exposure of the deep class fissures in South Korea has struck an evocative chord in America—and demonstrates that foreign cinema can penetrate the American psyche. #8216;Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,#8217; he said[5] after Parasite became the first Korean film to win a Golden Globe. Parasite's success in the US market is a little surprising, in part because most Americans and the US media show little interest in South Korea's internal dynamics and complex domestic politics. Yet, despite some criticism, including in this magazine[6], of Bong's satiric take on inequality, the film has taught many viewers that there's an intriguing and even revolutionary side to South Korea outside of K-Pop and the DMZ. Now, if only someone could make a film to correct the myths and assumptions that have driven American policy on the Korean Peninsula for decades and led to the latest breakdown in the Korea peace process that began with such promise[7] in the winter of 2018.  Related Articles Just as the South is often stereotyped as a model capitalist economy that would not exist without the beneficent presence of US troops, North Korea is universally viewed in Washington as a kind of Forever Enemy ruled by an irrational family dynasty that, for no apparent reason, hates the United States and belligerently threatens its friends and allies with nukes. Why they built these weapons is rarely addressed. And the roots of the conflict—the division of Korea in 1945 at the hands of the United States and a war that has never formally ended—are generally ignored. For example: The Great Successor[8], the acclaimed biography of Kim Jong-un and the nuclear crisis by Washington Post reporter Anna Fifield, doesn't even mention the fact that the United States first introduced nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and, after withdrawing them in 1991, still maintains a powerful nuclear force in Northeast Asia. Some commentators dismiss Kim's fears of the United States—which laid waste to his lands during the Korean War—as sheer fantasy. #8216;Like all dictators, Kim thrives on conflict with the outside world, especially the U.S., which the hermit kingdom's state-run media likes to call the #8216;savage enemy,'#8217; The Dallas Morning News recently proclaimed[9], as if Kim's weapons program was due simply to his need for an enemy. To buttress its case, it threw in a quote from B.R. Myers, whose 2010 book The Cleanest Race is, in my view[10], one of the most distorted books ever written about the North: #8216;Without the U.S., without that enemy figure, [North Korea] really has no reason to exist.#8217;  Current Issue https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/ It's as if the United States is an innocent bystander, just doing its darndest to maintain the peace against a belligerent foe that never lets up. That ahistorical approach also pertains to Pyongyang's diplomacy with Trump. The consensus in Washington's think tank world is that Kim's reluctance to immediately get rid of all his nukes after his 2018 summit with Trump—and his testing last year of missiles that could potentially hit US bases in South Korea, Japan, and Guam during a war or to ward off an attack—are proof of his aggressive intent and his insincerity about seeking peace. Even though no formal agreements have been reached on denuclearization or improving US#8212;North Korea ties, Kim is just #8216;playing#8217; Trump by building up his military forces, the thinking goes. #8216;All these advances, made during a period when the relationship between Pyongyang and Washington was supposedly never better, show that Kim is not interested in disarming,#8217; Eric Brewer, a nuclear analyst and former national security official at the corporate- and contractor-funded[11] Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote[12] this month in a typical comment. For the most part, the media seem to agree, and the American people follow[13]. According to a poll conducted[14] in November by The Economist, 56 percent of Americans consider North Korea to be an enemy of the United States, up from 51 percent in August. Many Democratic leaders are in the distortion game too. #8216;Look, we gave [Kim] everything he's looking for,#8217; Joe Biden declared[15] at the last Democratic debate on January 14 in explaining why he would refuse to meet with the North Korean leader without preconditions. #8216;The president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him.#8217;  Biden also claimed that he would somehow pressure China—which has lately been working with Russia[16] to win support in the UN for a proposal to ease sanctions on North Korea—to force its ally to disarm. None of this was remotely true, but Biden's claims weren't challenged by any of his fellow candidates or the press. Thankfully, there is a South Korean who can, as Bong Joon-ho and his ensemble did in Parasite, cut through the fog.  Moon Chung-in is a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University and a key adviser to President Moon Jae-in on national security and unification issues. An erudite, affable man well-known to US policy-makers, Moon travels frequently to Washington to unofficially convey South Korea's views. He's been to Pyongyang several times, most recently in September 2018, when he accompanied President Moon to his exuberant summit[17] with Kim Jong-un, where a major deal was struck to lower military tensions.             https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/moon-chung-in-img.jpg Moon Chung-in speaking at the Center for the National Interest, January 6. (Tim Shorrock) There, #8216;I saw the great possibility of peace,#8217; Moon Chung-in said during his latest visit to DC in January. As a result of the North-South agreement in Pyongyang, #8216;there's been no clashes on the DMZ#8217; since then. The #8216;only violation#8217; of the agreement came in early 2019, he said, when Kim Jong-un ordered a military exercise deploying short-range missiles. But for the North, he said, Trump's refusal to budge on sanctions as a way to get a deal with Kim is at the heart of their dispute. #8216;For Pyongyang, Washington's call for dialogue is nothing but a fig leaf to hide its intention to isolate, contain and strangle the North through sanctions and maximum pressure,#8217; he wrote[18] in The Korea Times. #8216;A catastrophic turn does not appear imminent, but time seems to be on nobody's side.#8217; In public remarks, he also pointed out that the North is increasingly irked by the criticism of its intentions from US politicians. #8216;Their concern is how American political stakeholders take advantage of North Korea for personal political gain.#8217; Here's the problem, from the South Korean's perspective: Since the first summit in Singapore[19], the Trump administration, despite pleadings from Seoul, has refused to lift sanctions on the North, even ones that could have helped President Moon carry out economic projects that he and Kim agreed to at their summit in Pyongyang. The lack of progress in the inter-Korean peace process, and South Korea's own military buildup, have greatly angered Kim and the North Korean leadership, who in the fall of 2019 resumed their harsh public criticism of the South and the United States. The tensions were quite apparent on January 1, when Kim delivered a New Year's statement and warned his nation to prepare for more hard times ahead. #8216;The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future,#8217; Kim said[20] in remarks carried by KCNA, the state media outlet. Flanked by hundreds of cadre from his ruling Korean Workers' Party, Kim talked mysteriously of a #8216;new strategic weapon#8217; he might deliver in the future—but left the door open for dialogue if the United States makes a fundamental change and stops treating North Korea like an enemy. #8216;If the US persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK, there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula,#8217; Kim warned, using a phrase that North Korea has been repeating for years, if not decades. His phrasing was repeated word-for-word[21] this week in Geneva, when Ju Yong Chol, one of Kim's diplomats at the UN, warned[22] that if America's #8216;hostile policy#8217; continued, the North would have #8216;no reason to be unilaterally bound any longer by the commitment that the other party fails to honor.#8217; Chol added: #8216;If the United States tries to enforce unilateral demands and persists in imposing sanctions, North Korea may be compelled to seek a new path,#8217; which US officials and generals believe[23] could include reviving the tests of long-range missiles that were suspended in 2017.  Unfortunately for the North, Dr. Moon said, many US policy-makers ignore the term #8216;hostile policy,#8217; claiming that Kim's use of it is just #8216;habitual.#8217; In doing so, he pointed out, they miss a chance to understand how an actual deal might be cut with North Korea under the right conditions. #8216;#8216;Hostile policy' is quite seriously meant,#8217; he told a conference on January 6 organized by the Center for the National Interest, a conservative think tank in Washington. They believe the policy #8216;threatens the security of North Korea and hampers the North Korean people's right to exist.#8217; During the Q&A, I asked Moon to explain what he made of the term, and he provided the most specific explanation I have heard in years of covering the issue. #8216;North Korea has been very clear,#8217; he replied. First, they mean the #8216;elimination of sanctions,#8217; which to them is #8216;the most important indicator of the hostile policy from the United States.#8217; Second, political matters: #8216;Normalize. Make [diplomatic] ties. Set up liaison offices, set up embassies with each other. That would be their most important indicator of ending the hostility.#8217; Third, the military side: #8216;A non-aggression treaty, signing a lasting peace treaty. Obviously suspending joint military exercise and training#8217; with South Korea #8216;and not deploying strategic weapons on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Finally, the North wants the United States to help make it #8216;a normal country in the international economic system.#8217; That means #8216;not only lifting sanctions but allowing North Korea to be a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank, and to let North Korea engage in normal trade and financial transactions and allow international investment into North Korea. It's all very clear.#8217; Obviously, meeting those demands would require a major shift in policy on the part of the United States, with North Korea no longer seen as a permanent enemy. For the North, they are an essential part of any deal, just as long-term denuclearization is for the United States. That, Moon explained, should underscore why Washington can't insist on #8216;permanent and irreversible#8217; denuclearization in North Korea—Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's favorite phrase—before making any moves to reduce the sanctions. #8216;That won't work,#8217; Moon said. #8216;It's why North Korea says you must #8216;permanently and irreversibly' withdraw your hostile policy#8217; before it will come back to the table. #8216;They're using your own words,#8217; he said with a chuckle. #8216;So there's a complete parallel between Washington and Pyongyang.#8217; And that's why, in his view, both sides #8216;need to be more flexible and realistic.#8217; In his address to the center, Moon indirectly confirmed reports in my last dispatch for The Nation[24] that a US#8212;South Korea military buildup over the past two years may have damaged prospects for a settlement by aggravating the North. Since Moon Jae-in took power in 2017, he explained, the president has emphasized #8216;peace-keeping,#8217; by which he means #8216;suppressing the possibility of war through deterrence and strengthening the US military alliance.#8217; This policy emerged as a result of the tensions during the #8216;nightmarish#8217; year of 2017, when war appeared imminent, as well as from military decisions made by #8216;previous governments#8217; with the United States. As a result, South Korea has acquired advanced US weapons, including F-35 fighter jets and high-altitude Global Hawk drones, as I described in my Nation story. Meanwhile, in 2020, South Korea will spend 53 trillion won—about $46 billion—on its military, #8216;slightly larger than Japan,#8217; Moon said. #8216;Contrary to what conservatives in South Korea claim, we have been cooperating with the United States 100 percent.#8217; But North Korea is #8216;very angry about that,#8217; he said. #8216;We see the idea of peace-keeping as defensive,#8217; but Pyongyang #8216;doesn't see it that way.#8217; As a result, #8216;peace-keeping has been sort of backfiring.#8217; But, while South Korea and the United States have worked in tandem to maintain their military readiness, the #8216;peace-building#8217; aspect of President Moon Jae-in's policies has fallen by the wayside. When President Moon launched his initiative in 2018, he envisioned that the United States and the two Koreas could sign a declaration ending the Korean War and transform the 1953 armistice that ended the fighting into a #8216;viable peace regime,#8217; the professor said. But the Trump administration has showed no interest in ending the war or signing a peace treaty, so that plan has gone unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the hard line on sanctions #8216;has prevented South Korea's engagement with North Korea,#8217; said Moon Chung-in. Projects halted included plans to restore cross-border rail links, reopening the Gaesong Industrial Zone just north of the DMZ, and making it possible for South Koreans to visit Mount Kumgang in the North once again. As a result, Moon said, #8216;inter-Korean relations are completely frozen.#8217; That, in turn, has created a serious political dilemma for South Korea in its cooperation with the United States. #8216;If the US fails to reopen negotiations with North Korea#8217; and settle its conflict with Kim, #8216;it can't make a breakthrough.#8217; And because South Korea is a democracy, #8216;President Moon's supporters say South Korea must take an independent stand.#8217; With some prescience, he added that President Moon #8216;doesn't want to be passive. He wants to be a mediator, a facilitator, and arbitrator, and a pacesetter of the Korean destiny.#8217; That process has apparently started. On January 14, President Moon declared[25] in a press conference that he would henceforth stress cooperation with the North over the negotiations between the United States and Pyongyang. #8216;Rather than only watching North Korea#8212;US dialogue, we need to cooperate with North Korea on as many things as possible,#8217; he told reporters at the Blue House. #8216;Since inter-Korean relations are a Korean matter, we need to take more of the initiative in developing them.#8217; As the progressive newspaper Hankyoreh noted[26], #8216;the gist of these remarks is that inter-Korean relations should be the driver of the peace process on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Moon's speech sparked an extraordinary dispute when Harry Harris[27], the US ambassador, told foreign reporters in Seoul[28] that South Korea must consult with Washington on any plans for cross-border engagement with the North #8216;in order to avoid a misunderstanding later that could trigger sanctions.#8217; In response, Lee Sang-min, a spokesperson for the Unification Ministry, reminded[29] Harris that South Korea is a sovereign nation that #8216;dictates its own policies#8217; toward the North. This week, the State Department backed[30] Harris, saying his views #8216;represent#8217; those of President Trump. But the Moon government appears determined to press on, even within the confines of the US and UN sanctions. On Tuesday, Lee Soo-hyuck, the South Korean ambassador in Washington, said[31] Seoul is especially hopeful that the cross-border railway project can be revived. #8216;I believe the project we should push for most urgently, and is doable, is connecting the railway network between South Korea and the North because it will take the longest [time] to complete,#8217; he told reporters. #8216;The overarching principle of the projects the government is pushing is that we should do the most we can within the framework of international sanctions.#8217; Despite the differences, Moon Chung-in says it's imperative for the talks between the three parties—Seoul, Pyongyang, and Washington—to get back on track. #8216;South Korea has heard North Korea's grievances,#8217; he said in Washington. #8216;It's time for North Korea to come back to the table and settle#8217; and for both sides to come up with innovative solutions. In his view, that might involve the United States' adopting a #8216;nuclear arms control paradigm#8217; toward the North, signing a peace treaty, and eventually negotiating a #8216;phased US troop withdrawal#8217; from the South as well as an international fund to support North Korea's denuclearization. #8216;We need creative diplomacy,#8217; he said. Perhaps the best antidote to the gloom is the sense of humor and humanity that both Dr. Moon and Parasite's characters adopt toward their brethren to the north. There's a hilarious scene[32] in Bong's film when one of his characters mimics the rapturous voice of Ri Chun-hee, North Korea's famous anchorwoman[33], who is often chosen to deliver the supreme leader's most momentous announcements to his people. But this gentle ribbing shouldn't necessarily be seen as criticizing the North, Bong said[34] in an interview last year. #8216;There are a lot of comics in South Korea who make sketches on [North Korean] topics and it's something that's very common in South Korea,#8217; he said. In other words, laughing about their situation is one way Koreans cope with the stress of division and war. But perhaps the deeper meaning is about survival in a city divided along class lines and a country split into rich South and poor North. #8216;I think the [Parasite] story is about coexistence and how we can all live together,#8217; Song Kang-ho[35], the beloved character actor who plays the family patriarch, said in receiving the cast's SAG award last Sunday. A little laughter—and a lot of truth—about America's dark fears of the North might go a long way in Washington too.

In a history-making sweep on January 13, it received six Oscar nominations, including one in the prestigious Best Picture category. Last Sunday, the Screen Actors Guild gave Parasite's acting ensemble its top award[3] for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, selecting it above the legendary lineups for The Irishman, Bombshell, Jojo Rabbit, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Ad Policy[4] For Bong, Parasite's manic and innovative director, it was overdue recognition. His brilliant exposure of the deep class fissures in South Korea has struck an evocative chord in America—and demonstrates that foreign cinema can penetrate the American psyche. #8216;Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,#8217; he said[5] after Parasite became the first Korean film to win a Golden Globe. Parasite's success in the US market is a little surprising, in part because most Americans and the US media show little interest in South Korea's internal dynamics and complex domestic politics. Yet, despite some criticism, including in this magazine[6], of Bong's satiric take on inequality, the film has taught many viewers that there's an intriguing and even revolutionary side to South Korea outside of K-Pop and the DMZ. Now, if only someone could make a film to correct the myths and assumptions that have driven American policy on the Korean Peninsula for decades and led to the latest breakdown in the Korea peace process that began with such promise[7] in the winter of 2018.  Related Articles Just as the South is often stereotyped as a model capitalist economy that would not exist without the beneficent presence of US troops, North Korea is universally viewed in Washington as a kind of Forever Enemy ruled by an irrational family dynasty that, for no apparent reason, hates the United States and belligerently threatens its friends and allies with nukes. Why they built these weapons is rarely addressed. And the roots of the conflict—the division of Korea in 1945 at the hands of the United States and a war that has never formally ended—are generally ignored. For example: The Great Successor[8], the acclaimed biography of Kim Jong-un and the nuclear crisis by Washington Post reporter Anna Fifield, doesn't even mention the fact that the United States first introduced nuclear weapons to the Korean Peninsula in the 1950s and, after withdrawing them in 1991, still maintains a powerful nuclear force in Northeast Asia. Some commentators dismiss Kim's fears of the United States—which laid waste to his lands during the Korean War—as sheer fantasy. #8216;Like all dictators, Kim thrives on conflict with the outside world, especially the U.S., which the hermit kingdom's state-run media likes to call the #8216;savage enemy,'#8217; The Dallas Morning News recently proclaimed[9], as if Kim's weapons program was due simply to his need for an enemy. To buttress its case, it threw in a quote from B.R. Myers, whose 2010 book The Cleanest Race is, in my view[10], one of the most distorted books ever written about the North: #8216;Without the U.S., without that enemy figure, [North Korea] really has no reason to exist.#8217;  Current Issue https://www.thenation.com/issue/february-3-2020-issue/ It's as if the United States is an innocent bystander, just doing its darndest to maintain the peace against a belligerent foe that never lets up. That ahistorical approach also pertains to Pyongyang's diplomacy with Trump. The consensus in Washington's think tank world is that Kim's reluctance to immediately get rid of all his nukes after his 2018 summit with Trump—and his testing last year of missiles that could potentially hit US bases in South Korea, Japan, and Guam during a war or to ward off an attack—are proof of his aggressive intent and his insincerity about seeking peace. Even though no formal agreements have been reached on denuclearization or improving US#8212;North Korea ties, Kim is just #8216;playing#8217; Trump by building up his military forces, the thinking goes. #8216;All these advances, made during a period when the relationship between Pyongyang and Washington was supposedly never better, show that Kim is not interested in disarming,#8217; Eric Brewer, a nuclear analyst and former national security official at the corporate- and contractor-funded[11] Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote[12] this month in a typical comment. For the most part, the media seem to agree, and the American people follow[13]. According to a poll conducted[14] in November by The Economist, 56 percent of Americans consider North Korea to be an enemy of the United States, up from 51 percent in August. Many Democratic leaders are in the distortion game too. #8216;Look, we gave [Kim] everything he's looking for,#8217; Joe Biden declared[15] at the last Democratic debate on January 14 in explaining why he would refuse to meet with the North Korean leader without preconditions. #8216;The president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him.#8217;  Biden also claimed that he would somehow pressure China—which has lately been working with Russia[16] to win support in the UN for a proposal to ease sanctions on North Korea—to force its ally to disarm. None of this was remotely true, but Biden's claims weren't challenged by any of his fellow candidates or the press. Thankfully, there is a South Korean who can, as Bong Joon-ho and his ensemble did in Parasite, cut through the fog.  Moon Chung-in is a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University and a key adviser to President Moon Jae-in on national security and unification issues. An erudite, affable man well-known to US policy-makers, Moon travels frequently to Washington to unofficially convey South Korea's views. He's been to Pyongyang several times, most recently in September 2018, when he accompanied President Moon to his exuberant summit[17] with Kim Jong-un, where a major deal was struck to lower military tensions.             https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/moon-chung-in-img.jpg Moon Chung-in speaking at the Center for the National Interest, January 6. (Tim Shorrock) There, #8216;I saw the great possibility of peace,#8217; Moon Chung-in said during his latest visit to DC in January. As a result of the North-South agreement in Pyongyang, #8216;there's been no clashes on the DMZ#8217; since then. The #8216;only violation#8217; of the agreement came in early 2019, he said, when Kim Jong-un ordered a military exercise deploying short-range missiles. But for the North, he said, Trump's refusal to budge on sanctions as a way to get a deal with Kim is at the heart of their dispute. #8216;For Pyongyang, Washington's call for dialogue is nothing but a fig leaf to hide its intention to isolate, contain and strangle the North through sanctions and maximum pressure,#8217; he wrote[18] in The Korea Times. #8216;A catastrophic turn does not appear imminent, but time seems to be on nobody's side.#8217; In public remarks, he also pointed out that the North is increasingly irked by the criticism of its intentions from US politicians. #8216;Their concern is how American political stakeholders take advantage of North Korea for personal political gain.#8217; Here's the problem, from the South Korean's perspective: Since the first summit in Singapore[19], the Trump administration, despite pleadings from Seoul, has refused to lift sanctions on the North, even ones that could have helped President Moon carry out economic projects that he and Kim agreed to at their summit in Pyongyang. The lack of progress in the inter-Korean peace process, and South Korea's own military buildup, have greatly angered Kim and the North Korean leadership, who in the fall of 2019 resumed their harsh public criticism of the South and the United States. The tensions were quite apparent on January 1, when Kim delivered a New Year's statement and warned his nation to prepare for more hard times ahead. #8216;The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future,#8217; Kim said[20] in remarks carried by KCNA, the state media outlet. Flanked by hundreds of cadre from his ruling Korean Workers' Party, Kim talked mysteriously of a #8216;new strategic weapon#8217; he might deliver in the future—but left the door open for dialogue if the United States makes a fundamental change and stops treating North Korea like an enemy. #8216;If the US persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK, there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula,#8217; Kim warned, using a phrase that North Korea has been repeating for years, if not decades. His phrasing was repeated word-for-word[21] this week in Geneva, when Ju Yong Chol, one of Kim's diplomats at the UN, warned[22] that if America's #8216;hostile policy#8217; continued, the North would have #8216;no reason to be unilaterally bound any longer by the commitment that the other party fails to honor.#8217; Chol added: #8216;If the United States tries to enforce unilateral demands and persists in imposing sanctions, North Korea may be compelled to seek a new path,#8217; which US officials and generals believe[23] could include reviving the tests of long-range missiles that were suspended in 2017.  Unfortunately for the North, Dr. Moon said, many US policy-makers ignore the term #8216;hostile policy,#8217; claiming that Kim's use of it is just #8216;habitual.#8217; In doing so, he pointed out, they miss a chance to understand how an actual deal might be cut with North Korea under the right conditions. #8216;#8216;Hostile policy' is quite seriously meant,#8217; he told a conference on January 6 organized by the Center for the National Interest, a conservative think tank in Washington. They believe the policy #8216;threatens the security of North Korea and hampers the North Korean people's right to exist.#8217; During the Q&A, I asked Moon to explain what he made of the term, and he provided the most specific explanation I have heard in years of covering the issue. #8216;North Korea has been very clear,#8217; he replied. First, they mean the #8216;elimination of sanctions,#8217; which to them is #8216;the most important indicator of the hostile policy from the United States.#8217; Second, political matters: #8216;Normalize. Make [diplomatic] ties. Set up liaison offices, set up embassies with each other. That would be their most important indicator of ending the hostility.#8217; Third, the military side: #8216;A non-aggression treaty, signing a lasting peace treaty. Obviously suspending joint military exercise and training#8217; with South Korea #8216;and not deploying strategic weapons on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Finally, the North wants the United States to help make it #8216;a normal country in the international economic system.#8217; That means #8216;not only lifting sanctions but allowing North Korea to be a member of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank, and to let North Korea engage in normal trade and financial transactions and allow international investment into North Korea. It's all very clear.#8217; Obviously, meeting those demands would require a major shift in policy on the part of the United States, with North Korea no longer seen as a permanent enemy. For the North, they are an essential part of any deal, just as long-term denuclearization is for the United States. That, Moon explained, should underscore why Washington can't insist on #8216;permanent and irreversible#8217; denuclearization in North Korea—Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's favorite phrase—before making any moves to reduce the sanctions. #8216;That won't work,#8217; Moon said. #8216;It's why North Korea says you must #8216;permanently and irreversibly' withdraw your hostile policy#8217; before it will come back to the table. #8216;They're using your own words,#8217; he said with a chuckle. #8216;So there's a complete parallel between Washington and Pyongyang.#8217; And that's why, in his view, both sides #8216;need to be more flexible and realistic.#8217; In his address to the center, Moon indirectly confirmed reports in my last dispatch for The Nation[24] that a US#8212;South Korea military buildup over the past two years may have damaged prospects for a settlement by aggravating the North. Since Moon Jae-in took power in 2017, he explained, the president has emphasized #8216;peace-keeping,#8217; by which he means #8216;suppressing the possibility of war through deterrence and strengthening the US military alliance.#8217; This policy emerged as a result of the tensions during the #8216;nightmarish#8217; year of 2017, when war appeared imminent, as well as from military decisions made by #8216;previous governments#8217; with the United States. As a result, South Korea has acquired advanced US weapons, including F-35 fighter jets and high-altitude Global Hawk drones, as I described in my Nation story. Meanwhile, in 2020, South Korea will spend 53 trillion won—about $46 billion—on its military, #8216;slightly larger than Japan,#8217; Moon said. #8216;Contrary to what conservatives in South Korea claim, we have been cooperating with the United States 100 percent.#8217; But North Korea is #8216;very angry about that,#8217; he said. #8216;We see the idea of peace-keeping as defensive,#8217; but Pyongyang #8216;doesn't see it that way.#8217; As a result, #8216;peace-keeping has been sort of backfiring.#8217; But, while South Korea and the United States have worked in tandem to maintain their military readiness, the #8216;peace-building#8217; aspect of President Moon Jae-in's policies has fallen by the wayside. When President Moon launched his initiative in 2018, he envisioned that the United States and the two Koreas could sign a declaration ending the Korean War and transform the 1953 armistice that ended the fighting into a #8216;viable peace regime,#8217; the professor said. But the Trump administration has showed no interest in ending the war or signing a peace treaty, so that plan has gone unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the hard line on sanctions #8216;has prevented South Korea's engagement with North Korea,#8217; said Moon Chung-in. Projects halted included plans to restore cross-border rail links, reopening the Gaesong Industrial Zone just north of the DMZ, and making it possible for South Koreans to visit Mount Kumgang in the North once again. As a result, Moon said, #8216;inter-Korean relations are completely frozen.#8217; That, in turn, has created a serious political dilemma for South Korea in its cooperation with the United States. #8216;If the US fails to reopen negotiations with North Korea#8217; and settle its conflict with Kim, #8216;it can't make a breakthrough.#8217; And because South Korea is a democracy, #8216;President Moon's supporters say South Korea must take an independent stand.#8217; With some prescience, he added that President Moon #8216;doesn't want to be passive. He wants to be a mediator, a facilitator, and arbitrator, and a pacesetter of the Korean destiny.#8217; That process has apparently started. On January 14, President Moon declared[25] in a press conference that he would henceforth stress cooperation with the North over the negotiations between the United States and Pyongyang. #8216;Rather than only watching North Korea#8212;US dialogue, we need to cooperate with North Korea on as many things as possible,#8217; he told reporters at the Blue House. #8216;Since inter-Korean relations are a Korean matter, we need to take more of the initiative in developing them.#8217; As the progressive newspaper Hankyoreh noted[26], #8216;the gist of these remarks is that inter-Korean relations should be the driver of the peace process on the Korean Peninsula.#8217; Moon's speech sparked an extraordinary dispute when Harry Harris[27], the US ambassador, told foreign reporters in Seoul[28] that South Korea must consult with Washington on any plans for cross-border engagement with the North #8216;in order to avoid a misunderstanding later that could trigger sanctions.#8217; In response, Lee Sang-min, a spokesperson for the Unification Ministry, reminded[29] Harris that South Korea is a sovereign nation that #8216;dictates its own policies#8217; toward the North. This week, the State Department backed[30] Harris, saying his views #8216;represent#8217; those of President Trump. But the Moon government appears determined to press on, even within the confines of the US and UN sanctions. On Tuesday, Lee Soo-hyuck, the South Korean ambassador in Washington, said[31] Seoul is especially hopeful that the cross-border railway project can be revived. #8216;I believe the project we should push for most urgently, and is doable, is connecting the railway network between South Korea and the North because it will take the longest [time] to complete,#8217; he told reporters. #8216;The overarching principle of the projects the government is pushing is that we should do the most we can within the framework of international sanctions.#8217; Despite the differences, Moon Chung-in says it's imperative for the talks between the three parties—Seoul, Pyongyang, and Washington—to get back on track. #8216;South Korea has heard North Korea's grievances,#8217; he said in Washington. #8216;It's time for North Korea to come back to the table and settle#8217; and for both sides to come up with innovative solutions. In his view, that might involve the United States' adopting a #8216;nuclear arms control paradigm#8217; toward the North, signing a peace treaty, and eventually negotiating a #8216;phased US troop withdrawal#8217; from the South as well as an international fund to support North Korea's denuclearization. #8216;We need creative diplomacy,#8217; he said. Perhaps the best antidote to the gloom is the sense of humor and humanity that both Dr. Moon and Parasite's characters adopt toward their brethren to the north. There's a hilarious scene[32] in Bong's film when one of his characters mimics the rapturous voice of Ri Chun-hee, North Korea's famous anchorwoman[33], who is often chosen to deliver the supreme leader's most momentous announcements to his people. But this gentle ribbing shouldn't necessarily be seen as criticizing the North, Bong said[34] in an interview last year. #8216;There are a lot of comics in South Korea who make sketches on [North Korean] topics and it's something that's very common in South Korea,#8217; he said. In other words, laughing about their situation is one way Koreans cope with the stress of division and war. But perhaps the deeper meaning is about survival in a city divided along class lines and a country split into rich South and poor North. #8216;I think the [Parasite] story is about coexistence and how we can all live together,#8217; Song Kang-ho[35], the beloved character actor who plays the family patriarch, said in receiving the cast's SAG award last Sunday. A little laughter—and a lot of truth—about America's dark fears of the North might go a long way in Washington too.

After Parasite's mould-breaking win at the 2020 awards, the running for Best Picture looks to be another historic year, with two women nominated in the Best Picture and Best Director categories for the first time ever. 
In the run-up to the Oscars 2021 ceremony  on Saturday April 25 (Sunday 26, 12.30am for UK viewers), we take a look back at all 92 Best Picture winners, exploring such cinematic landmarks as the transition into Technicolour and the surprise win that beat Citizen Kane to the Best Picture title. 
                     Oscars Best Picture winners list                   
                      1. 1929: Wings                   
Wings will forever have its place guaranteed in cinematic history due to the fact that it won the inaugural Best Picture Oscar for the 1927-28 award (a two-year eligibility period was used for the first six years of the ceremony). But this thrilling epic about a love triangle during World War I - for over 80 years, the only silent film to win Best Picture - merits wider recognition.
From its archetypal Hollywood melodrama, to its dazzling depiction of dogfights, and a standout performance from Clara Bow as the plucky nurse Mary, the 144-minute runtime glides by.
                                            2. 1930: The Broadway Melody                                        
The formerly little-known production company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) was founded in 1924, and only five years later it had chalked up its first Academy Award win. The Broadway Melody - MGM's first ever musical - tells the tale of Harriet (Bessie Love) and Queenie Mahoney (Anite Page), a beautiful vaudeville act who arrive at Broadway, and become swept up in New York high society.
While it was wildly successful at the time, it seems audiences were more impressed by the mere presence of sound and Technicolor sequences, because the musical numbers are banal and uninspired.
                                            3. 1931: All Quiet on the Western Front                                        
Adapted from the novel by Erich Maria Remarque, a German veteran of the First World War, this film centres on a group of German schoolboys, who are convinced to enlist by their jingoistic professor. Director Lewis Milestone, who won a second consecutive Best Director Oscar for the film, made one of the most influential anti-war films ever simply by showing the ravages of war through the eyes of these young German recruits.
                                            4. 1932: Cimarron                                        
Perhaps as a reflection of the movie industry's growing prowess, RKO Radio Pictures invested more than $1.5 million into their production of Edna Ferber's epic novel about the history of a frontier family, despite being mired in the woes of the Great Depression.
The Oklahoma Land Rush of 1889 prompted thousands to relocate to claim free government land, and in Cimarron, Yancey Cravat (Richard Dix) takes his young family to build their newspaper Oklahoma Wigwam into an empire.
                                            5. 1933: Grand Hotel                                        
Reworked from former chambermaid Vicki Baum's novel Menschen im Hotel, the film stars Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Joan Crawford as guests in Berlin's grandest hotel. Joan Crawford once said of her performance in Grand Hotel: "Little Joan was called upon to match Garbo, Beery and the Barrymores and she came off smelling like a rose."
It's difficult to begrudge the actor such an accolade given her showing as the glittering, ambitious stenographer Flaemmchen.
                                            6. 1934: Cavalcade                                        
Directed by Frank Lloyd and adapted from the Noel Coward play, Cavalcade was a darling of the box-office and critics alike. It was even credited with stirring up patriotism before that year's general election.
From the turn of the twentieth century, we view a changing Britain through the lives of two families: the swanky Marryots (Diana Wynyard and Clive Brook) and their staff, the Bridges (Una O'Connor and Herbert Mundin).
                                            7. 1935: It Happened One Night                                        
'Daughter escaped again!' shouts the father of capricious heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) as she swims away from his yacht. On her way to one unsuitable man she falls for another: the struggling reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable) who offers her help in exchange for a society scoop.
It Happened One Night won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Actor, Actress, Director (Frank Capra) and Screenplay, making it the first film to win all five of the big awards.
                                            8. 1936: Mutiny on the Bounty                                        
Based on a cycle of bestselling novels co-written by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, this rollicking movie became one of the quintessential nautical adventures. Directed by Frank Lloyd, it focuses on an eighteenth century voyage from Tahiti to the West Indies.
Smarting from the cruelty of Captain Bligh (Charles Laughton), the noble first mate Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable) leads the crew of English conscripts to mutiny, and a new life on a paradise island.
Being filmed on location, Mutiny on the Bounty blew its $2 million budget, but became the most profitable film of the year.
                                            9. 1937: The Great Ziegfeld                                        
Running at three hours, requiring a thousand employees, and taking hundreds of designers six months to produce its costumes, Robert Z. Leonard and Hunt Stromberg's The Great Ziegfeld is seen to epitomise the glamour and extravagance of Hollywood's golden age.
Inspired by the real-life Chicago impresario Flo Ziegfeld Jr., it charts the multiple rises, falls, rivalries and marriages of the charismatic showman, here played by William Powell. It was one of the biggest movies of the 1930s.
                                            10. 1938: The Life of Emile Zola                                        
William Dieterle's portrait of the famous French author was lauded by critics upon release, being proclaimed the best biographical picture yet made.
A fictionalised account of the writer's battle for social justice, the film centres on his historical involvement in the Dreyfus Affair, which saw an innocent Jewish soldier accused of treason to cover up the crime of a wealthy superior.
But as it was filmed against the backdrop of the rise of the Nazis and their oppression of European Jews, people still debate whether the film could have done more to denounce anti-semitism.
                                            11. 1939: You Can't Take It With You                                        
Scooping Frank Capra his third Best Director Oscar as well as the Best Picture, You Can't Take It With You is an adaptation of the Pulitzer-Prize winning play of the same name by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart.
The romantic comedy starring James Stewart and Jean Arthur follows a head-on collision of values and lifestyle when stenographer Alice (Arthur) introduces her eccentric and unmaterialistic family to the relatives of her fiance Tony (Stewart), who are wealthy, status-driven tycoons.
                                            12. 1940: Gone With the Wind                                        
Winning 8 Oscars including Best Actress for Vivian Leigh and Best Director for Victor Fleming, this classic adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel remains the most successful film in box office history.
Set against the backdrop of the American Civil War and reconstruction, it follows the romantic travails of a plantation owner's daughter, Scarlett O'Hara.
It was an epic in every sense: over 1400 women were allegedly interviewed in the famous 'search for Scarlett', and Fleming was briefly replaced as director by Sam Wood, while he took time off due to exhaustion.
                                            13. 1941: Rebecca                                        
This early Hitchcock thriller portrays a naive young bride, who marries rich widower Maxim De Winter, and soon discovers how he is still troubled by the death of his first wife, Rebecca, in a boating accident the year before. Rebecca's death seems to have had an unnatural effect on all the residents of De Winter's large country estate.
Despite not including the one murder that takes place in the Du Maurier novel, the film still evokes all the psychological unease and suspense we would expect from a Hitchcock.
                                            14. 1942: How Green Was My Valley                                        
One of the few Hollywood blockbusters set in rural Wales, How Green Was My Valley tells the story of the Morgans through the eyes of their youngest son, Huw. The family live in a mining village at the turn of the century, and through portraying their trials and tribulations, the film also charts the destruction of the environment in the Welsh coalfields and deteriorating conditions for miners.
Based on the 1939 Richard Llewellyn novel, the film scooped five Oscars, beating Citizen Kane in both the Best Film and Best Director categories.
                                            15. 1943: Mrs Miniver                                        
Set in a fictional English town, Mrs Miniver charts the effects of World War II on the lives of a rural housewife and her family. Though the men in her life go to war, her son signing up to join the RAF and her husband volunteering to take his boat to the Dunkirk evacuation, the women are still exposed to the conflict when a German pilot parachutes into the garden.
The film won six Oscars, including Best Director for Walter Wyler, and earning Walter Pidgeon his first Best Actor nomination.
                                            16. 1944: Casablanca                                        
Casablanca is one of the best-loved films in all of cinema, and its denouement is one of the most quoted. Set in December 1941, the month Pearl Harbour pitched the United States into the Second World War, Humphrey Bogart's cynical bar owner rediscovers his lost political ideals when Ingrid Bergman, the woman he loved, and loves, walks into his gin-joint with a legendary resistance hero. Meanwhile, the movie features some of the finest character actors of the era.
                                            17. 1945: Going My Way                                        
Wartime America just adored this heartwarming tale of two country priests, and critics were as satisfied. Complete with singalongs from Bing Crosby, who took the Best Actor Oscar for his appearance, Going My Way won big during awards season. The film is about a young priest taking over a parish from an established old veteran, and went on to become the top-grossing release of the year ($6.5 million).
                                            18. 1946: The Lost Weekend                                        
The Lost Weekend is a frank, taboo-breaking examination of alcohol addiction, which follows the life of a chronic alcoholic-cum-failed novelist (Phillip Terry) over the course of a long weekend.
The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay). It was Billy Wilder's fourth directorial effort, after The Major and the Minor (1942), Five Graves to Cairo (1943), and the classic film noir Double Indemnity (1944).
                                            19. 1947: The Best Years of Our Lives                                        
Producer Samuel Goldwyn's classic American film is about the trauma and social displacement experienced by a group of returning veteran servicemen (Harold Russell, Frederic March, Dana Andrews) following World War II. Unemployment, adultery, and alcoholism plague their lives in this bitingly-ironic film title.
It sold approximately 55 million tickets in the United States, which equates to a gross of $24 million and remains the sixth most-attended film of all time in the UK, with over 20 million admissions registered.
                                            20. 1948: Gentleman's Agreement                                        
Adapted from Laura Z. Hobson's bestselling novel of the same name, Gentleman's Agreement tackles the subject of ingrained anti-semitism in America. When widowed journalist Philip Green (Gregory Peck) moves to New York City with his son and mother he is asked to research people's prejudices against Jews, and adopts a Jewish identity for himself and his family.
Noticing the difference in treatment he receives, and growing more aware of bigotry toward others, he reevaluates his own accepted ideals.
Gentleman's Agreement won three Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director (Elia Kazan) and Best Supporting Actress (Celeste Holm).
                                            21. 1949: Hamlet                                        
What better film to take Britain's first Academy Award for Best Picture? Sir Laurence Olivier held his audience's attention in his multiple capacity as producer, director, and adaptor of Shakespeare's play.
But it was Larry's performance in the most coveted role in all of acting which made history. He doesn't stop there. Did you know that Hamlet's father's ghost is him, too: his voice slowed down by a tape recorder?
                                            22. 1950: All the King's Men                                        
A small-town man with big ideas, Willie Stark (Broderick Crawford) rises from self-taught lawyer to champion of his local people to State Governor. But on the way he loses what originally set him apart from the ruthless politicians he hated in his early, idealistic days. Corrupt himself, and disloyal to those who are most loyal to him, he tries to defend himself against those who would see him fall.
Adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren, John Wayne  famously turned down the lead role, which meant that Broderick Crawford beat him to Best Actor when the awards came round.
                                            23. 1951: All About Eve                                        
Following the advancement of aspiring actress Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) from fan girl to golden girl, the people she has crossed gather to watch her accept an award.
This arch comedy about ambition in the theatre world garnered 14 Oscar Nominations, which would remain a record until Titanic came along in 1997.
And had the Academy given awards to collective female casts, All About Eve would no doubt have picked up one for its combination of Baxter, Bette Davis, Celeste Holm, Thelma Ritter and Marilyn Monroe. It is still the only film to have secured nominations for four of its actresses.
                                            24. 1952: An American in Paris                                        
A fully technicolour musical based on a score by George Gershwin, An American in Paris would certainly have been a sensory spectacle of the highest order. Three aspiring artists and musicians try to make names for themselves in Paris, with Gene Kelly playing Jerry, an American WWII veteran turned struggling painter.
One day he is picked up by a wealthy society belle (Nina Foch) who wishes to offer him more than just patronage, while Jerry falls for a girl he doesn't even know.
                                            25. 1953: The Greatest Show on Earth                                        
"We bring you the circus..." opens Cecil B. DeMille's large-scale technicolour, and bring it they did. The film featured the whole of Ringling bros and Barnum and Bailey's Circus troupe, comprising 1400 people, hundreds of animals and over 50 cartloads of equipment and tents. General manager Brad (Charlton Heston) finds himself in a tricky love triangle when he hires The Great Sebastian (Cornel Wilde) to replace his girlfriend Holly (Betty Hutton) in centre-ring.
The film caused controversy by winning Best Picture over films such as Ivanhoe, High Noon and Singin' in the Rain.
                                            26. 1954: From Here to Eternity                                        
Set in 1941 in the months leading up to Pearl Harbour, this military drama won eight Oscars of 13 nominations. Montgomery Clift stars as Private Robert E. Lee Prewett, a recent transfer to a barracks in Hawaii. When he refuses to join the regiment's boxing club, the captain sets out to punish him into submission, assisted by First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster). Prewitt only has the support of his friend Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra ).
                                            27. 1955: On the Waterfront                                        
Seen as the summit of his early movie career, Marlon Brando's portrayal of longshoreman Terry Malloy in On the Waterfront won him his first Oscar. The film, about Terry's struggle to stand against the corruption and mob control in the New Jersey docks where he works, also debuted Eva Marie Saint and earned Elia Kazan his second Best Director award.
Produced at the height of HUACs investigation of Hollywood, many saw the film (which explores the nature of testimony) as an attempt by Kazan to justify his decision to name communist affiliates in the House.
                                            28. 1956: Marty                                        
Ernest Borgnine plays lovelorn butcher Marty; 34, still living at home and under pressure from his parents to get married. His fortunes change when he meets school-teacher Clara (Betsy Blair) in a Bronx dancehall.
This neat and compact character study, adapted from writer Paddy Cheyefski's original TV drama takes place over a very short time-frame of a little over 24 hours, and won Cheyefsky best screenplay. Delbert Mann and Borgnine also received Best Director and Best Actor awards for their roles in the film.
                                            29. 1957: Around the World in 80 Days                                        
Like most films of the era, Around the World in 80 Days was a mammoth production, oozing American glamour, with over 40 cameos from the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Noel Coward, Frank Sinatra and Buster Keaton.
David Niven stars as the unflappable hero of Jules Verne's 1873 novel, assisted by the comedic butler Passepartout (played by prolific Mexican comedian Cantinflas).
Producer Michael Todd claimed they shot in every location featured in the film, and the picture was touted as a chance for audience to admire exotic locales. Interestingly, the iconic flight by hydrogen balloon was not a feature in Verne's novel.
                                            30. 1958: The Bridge on the River Kwai                                        
As part of a tourism drive in 2014, Sri Lanka rebuilt the replica bridge destroyed in an iconic scene from The Bridge on the River Kwai. In the film, the titular bridge is constructed by a band of British prisoners of war during World War II, who are ordered to do so to accommodate the Burma-Siam railway.
Alec Guinness delivers a poignant performance as Colonel Nicholson, an honourable but vain man in charge of the POWs. From a budget of $2.8 million, the movie took $30.6 million on its first release.
                                            31. 1959: Gigi                                        
Maurice Chevalier thanked heaven for little girls, and we got a case of "right director, wrong film", as Vincente Minnelli's stupidly lavish Parisian tuner won all the votes, and his far superior melodrama Some Came Running got left out of the, well, running.
As with many of Minnelli's musicals, Gigi fulfilled the important winning criteria: an original score, well-sketched characters, and a bittersweet romance. The film is considered the last great MGM musical.
                                            32. 1960: Ben-Hur                                        
Somehow the makers of the first Ben-Hur film, a silent movie from 1907, condensed all the action into a nine-minute one-reeler. The 1959 remake (there was another in 1926) was a landmark achievement in grand biblical storytelling for the cinema, and lasts three hours and 32 minutes.
Ben-Hur was the most expensive film ever made at the time, costing $15 million to shot in Technicolour. Its success ultimately saved MGM Studios from bankruptcy.
                                            33. 1961: The Apartment                                        
Back in 1960, to see someone on screen portraying genuine everyman anxiety - ie, not the camped-up Jerry Lewis kind - must have been something rather odd and special.
In Billy Wilder's darker-than-it-seems romantic comedy, Jack Lemmon (as CC Baxter) turns common-or-garden nerves into a revolutionary form of acting, his doleful stares and wildly gesticulating hands making for a mesmerising two hours, incorporating the subtlest kind of comic genius.
                                            34. 1962: West Side Story                                        
It's impossible to begrudge the vertiginous energy and feeling that make West Side Story one of the great American musicals, and one radically told through dance.
Jerome Robbins's legendary choreography needs the biggest screen it can get; when the movie's firing on all cylinders of music, lyrics and motion (twice: "America" and "Gee, Officer Krupke") there's little to touch it.
The film, set in 1950s blue-collar New York City, won 10 Oscars in total, claiming everything from Best Picture to Best Costume Design.
                                            35. 1963: Lawrence of Arabia                                        
David Lean and Sap Spiegel's epic, as well as being the inspiration for modern greats such as Steven Spielberg , George Lucas  and Martin Scorsese, is credited by most institutions and polls as one of the best films ever made.
Famed for its beautiful desert scenes and its central performance by Peter O'Toole, it is also, at 227 minutes, the longest film ever to win an Oscar for Best Picture.
A biopic of the controversial war hero T. E. Lawrence, it shows his progress from outspoken and learned intelligence officer to saviour of the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire during WWI.
                                            36. 1964: Tom Jones                                        
Henry Fielding's bawdy 18th century epic is considered one of the first true novels, and this raucous adaptation was one of the most successful comedies of its day.
Eccentric, too: it was noted for its unique mixture of cinematic techniques such as voice-over, silent-film set pieces and actors addressing the camera.
Wrongfully kicked out of his home, the wayward but good-intentioned orphan Tom Jones (Albert Finney) travels to London to find his fortune, but on the way must negotiate bandits, the law, high-society intrigue, and a liaison with someone who might be his long-lost mother.
                                            37. 1965: My Fair Lady                                        
My Fair Lady, which sees cockney flower-seller Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) transformed into a gentlewoman by elocution teacher Professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison), is lodged in our popular consciousness.
Based on a musical update of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion, it broached the subjects of class and the relation between the sexes.
Harrison took Best Actor for a role he had played since the inception of the original stage version, and musical numbers such as On the Street Where You Live and I Could Have Danced All Night remain classics to this day.
                                            38. 1966: The Sound of Music                                        
Nothing is more evocative of the musical genre than Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music, here made famous by Robert Wise's picture. Maria, a nun struggling to make a go of the religious life, becomes governess to a widowed naval captain's children, teaching them the value of music before the Nazis invade Austria.
The movie starring the legendary Julie Andrews won five Oscars and became the highest grossing film in history at the time, knocking Gone with the Wind off the top spot. Taking into account the standards of the day, it is the fifth highest grossing film of all time.
                                            39. 1967: A Man for All Seasons                                        
Fred Zinnemann's screen adaptation of Robert Bolt's acclaimed play about Sir Thomas More was an Oscars smash, winning six awards, including Best Director for Zinnemann and Best Actor for Paul Scofield, who had played More since the theatre version.
Once a beloved advisor and teacher to Henry VIII, More disagrees with his king over the divorce of his wife Catherine of Arragon. As Henry establishes the Church of England, he remains true to his Catholic conscience, refusing to recognise the King's religious authority, and eventually dies for his principles.
As well as making More a saint after his death, the Vatican unsurprisingly classes this among the greatest films of all time.
                                            40. 1968: In the Heat of the Night                                        
Norman Jewison's dramatic portrayal of racism and murder in the American South stars Sidney Poitier as Virgil Tibbs, Philadelphia's top homicide detective. While on a visit to Sparta, MS, Tibbs is arrested on general principles in the murder investigation of a prominent white businessman. On his identity being established, he is recruited to help the small-town team solve the crime.
At the time, having a non-white actor in a lead role was so controversial that the crew couldn't actually film in the Deep South, and instead recreated sets in Illinois and Tennessee. Despite this, the film was a triumph with critics, beating The Graduate to Best Picture.
                                            41. 1969: Oliver!                                        
The musical adaptation of Dickens' witty classic won five Oscars of six nominations, including Best Art Direction, and Best Musical Score for Johnny Green's arrangement of the broadway soundtrack. On escaping from the workhouse, orphan Oliver runs away to London, and is welcomed into Fagin's gang of young pickpockets.
Starring Ron Moody as Fagin, Shani Wallis as Nancy and Oliver Reed as Bill Sykes. It was the last musical film to win Best Picture until Chicago 34 years later in 2002.
                                            42. 1970: Midnight Cowboy                                        
The only X-rated film to ever win Best Picture, Midnight Cowboy follows the journey of Joe Buck, a young Texan dishwasher who travels to New York in an attempt to make money as a 'hustler'. Selling himself on the streets to little avail, he meets seasoned con-artist Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), and the pair strike up a working relationship.
Ratso's name would later be lent to Jim Henson's wise-cracking muppet Rizzo the Rat.
The film won Best Director for John Schlesinger and Waldo Salt scooped Best Screenplay for his adaptation of James Leo Herlihy's 1965 novel of the same name.
                                            43. 1971: Patton                                        
Subtitled 'A Salute to a Rebel', Patton is a portrait of the flamboyant, and outspoken American military general George S. Patton, (played by George C. Scott) who is described in the film as "a magnificent anachronism".
The plot follows his army career throughout World-War Two, from his leadership in Casablanca to the fall of the Third Reich. With his loud and colourful language and unabashed love of battle, Patton was a controversial figure, but one who very much suited the high-budget Hollywood war-film treatment.
The film won Francis Ford Coppola his first Oscar for Best Screenplay based on fact, and 6 other awards including Best Picture.
                                            44. 1972: The French Connection                                        
Gene Hackman plays short-tempered cop Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle in this fast-paced action thriller directed by William Friedkin. Along with his partner Buddy Russo (Roy Schneider), Doyle tails two French nationals to intercept a large shipment of heroin.
The film is inspired by the late 60s and early 70s drug trade, when swathes of illegal heroin in the East Coast was smuggled in via France. Doyle and Russo were based on real life narcotics detectives.
The film is perhaps most notable for the famous car chase in which Popeye chases an elevated subway train. Winning 5 Oscars, the film proved popular with both the critics and the box office.
                                            45. 1973: The Godfather                                        
Presenting producer Albert S. Ruddy's The Godfather with a Best Picture Oscar was an offer the Academy couldn't refuse.
Based on Puzo's eponymous best-selling novel, The Godfather is - with the possible exception of Goodfellas - the greatest and most influential film in the gangster genre. In 2007, it was ranked by the American Film Institute as second in their "greatest films of all time list", behind only Citizen Kane.
                                            46. 1974: The Sting                                        
In the pantheon of great male cinematic double acts, Robert Redford and Paul Newman are up there with Laurel and Hardy.  So memorable was their on-screen chemistry, it's easy to forget they only appeared in two films together.
Their first collaboration, the lyrical, vaguely comic western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), was directed by George Roy Hill and saw Redford and Newman pour charisma into their roles as insouciant outlaws.
Their next film was even better. A crafty, good-natured crime caper, The Sting (1973) reunited Hill with Redford and Newman and won seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.
                                            47. 1975: The Godfather Part II                                        
The Godfather is great, but director Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather: Part II is greater. It's that rare thing - a sequel that doesn't just match but actually surpasses the original film.
Not content with just recycling the same story, Part II illuminates and elaborates on the first part, adding a classically tragic dimension by using flashbacks to show the origins of the Corleone family, and then moving forward in time to show that same family ripping itself apart.
                                            48. 1976: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest                                        
Beautiful, devastating and hilarious, Milos Forman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's classic novel is the ultimate "buck the system" movie. When smooth-talking prisoner Randle McMurphy (Jack Nicholson ) cons his way into a mental asylum to ride out his sentence, he hasn't bargained on the despotic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher).
McMurphy refuses to tow the line, showing inmates that they're "no crazier than the average asshole on the streets", which leads to a battle of wills in which there can be only one winner.
                                            49. 1977: Rocky                                        
The film that broke Sylvester "Sly" Stallone's career as a Hollywood's hottest property for macho leads was the highest grossing movie of 1976, racking up $225 million at the box office.
Three decades later, and 16 years after Rocky V, Stallone was tempted to reprise his role as boxer Robert "Rocky" Balboa in 2006's lazily titled Rocky Balboa, and again in 2015 with Creed, which saw Stallone nominated for Best Supporting Actor.
                                            50. 1978: Annie Hall                                        
Annie Hall marks Woody Allen's  departure from simple farces to what we now think of as a classic Woody Allen movie: a mixture of hilarity, philosophy and self-annihilation.
Alvy Singer (Allen) is trying to work out what went wrong with his last girlfriend Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), and in so doing looks back into his own childhood and attempts to rewrite their relationship.
It picked up four Oscars at the 50th Academy Awards ceremony, including Best Director and Screenplay for Allen, and Best Actress for Keaton. The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw calls it the best comedy film of all time.
                                            51. 1979: The Deer Hunter                                        
Evocative and distressing in equal measure, The Deer Hunter is often hailed by the critics as an American epic in the same class as The Godfather films. In an iconic, exuberant opening section, a tight-knit group of Russian-American friends celebrate together, looking forward to enlisting in the Vietnam war.
The ensuing action shows, in another string of iconic scenes involving gambling halls and Russian roulette, what war does to them.
With a memorable soundtrack including Frankie Valli and a theme played by classical guitar legend John Williams, and a stellar cast featuring Robert De Niro , Christopher Walken, Meryl Streep  and John Cazale, The Deer Hunter picked up four Oscars.
                                            52. 1980: Kramer vs Kramer                                        
A touching film which focuses on the other side of family life, Kramer vs Kramer examines divorce and the impact for all involved. Ambitious ad-man Ted (Dustin Hoffman) is left alone to raise his son Billy after his wife Joanna (Meryl Streep) announces that she is leaving them.
Initially a struggle, over time Ted reevaluates his priorities and the father and son become close. But when Joanna returns over a year later to take Billy, the two Kramers battle for custody.
Both Kramers, it turns out, won Oscars. The film won five in all.
                                            53. 1981: Ordinary People                                        
Robert Redford's directorial debut earned him an Oscar, and dealt with a family's grief in its various manifestations. The Jarretts, a well-to-do family living in Chicago, lost their favourite son on a boating accident. While the younger son Conrad spends time in psychiatric hospital and blames himself, his mother denies it ever happened.
While most of the leads in the film received Oscar nominations or awards (Timothy Hutton got Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Conrad), Donald Sutherland didn't for his role as the father, Calvin, which was seen as bad form.
                                            54. 1982: Chariots of Fire                                        
"The British are coming" announced screenwriter Colin Welland as he won his Oscar for Chariots of Fire, a rousing classic about more British winners.
Celebrating the success of the 1924 Olympics running team, it follows the path of two passionate athletes: Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), a Jewish Cambridge student who finds in running a weapon against prejudice, and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a Christian Scotsman who feels God when he runs.
Since it was released, people have been imagining Vangelis' famous soundtrack whenever they see something in slow motion.
                                            55. 1983: Gandhi                                        
A biopic of Gandhi's life was Richard Attenborough's dream project, and this film was the final result of two previous unfinished attempts, making the whole project a labour of nearly 18 years.
The film introduces us to Mohandas K. Gandhi (played by Ben Kingsley in his second ever feature film role) as an English law student who forsakes all his worldly possessions to promote the cause of Indian independence from the British.
The film won Attenborough both Best Picture and Director as well as five other awards and a further three nominations.
                                            56. 1984: Terms of Endearment                                        
Simpson's producer James L. Brooks' cinematic debut charting the complex relationship between Aurora (Shirley MacLaine) and her daughter Emma (Debra Winger) was the second highest grossing film of that year, being pipped only (although quite substantially!) by Return of the Jedi.
Jack Nicholson won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role as ex-astronaut Garrett Breedlove, while MacLaine and Winger both garnered Best Actress nominations for their performances, MacLaine taking the trophy in the end.
                                            57. 1985: Amadeus                                        
An adaptation of the hit broadway production, the film reflects on the events leading to the death of prodigal musician Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart's arch rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls his sabotage from his current residence of an asylum.
The film garnered 11 nominations, winning 7, including Best Director for Milos Forman. In opposition to the legend, Salieri pipped Mozart at this awards season, with Murray Abraham clinching the Best Actor Oscar over Tom Hulce who played the role of Mozart.
                                            58. 1986: Out of Africa                                        
Meryl Streep stars as Karen Blixen-Flecke, a Danish woman who moves to a plantation in a British East Africa with her new husband Bror (Klaus Maria Brandauer). Left to her own devices on a farm which is largely neglected by Bror, she meets and develops a close relationship with local hunter Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford).
The film is based on a Karen's memoir, published under the pseudonym of Isak Dinesen.
The soundtrack won John Barry his third Best Music Oscar, while Sidney Pollack scooped Best Director, although Streep missed out on Best Actress, pipped by Geraldine Page.
                                            59. 1987: Platoon                                        
Described as the first real movie about the war in Vietnam, Platoon drew on director Oliver Stone's own experiences as an infantry soldier in Vietnam. Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) drops out of college to volunteer in the US army, and is sent with a platoon of other young soldiers to fight in Vietnam, where he quickly loses the innocent view of war he held before he left home.
Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger both received nominations for their roles as violent and ruthless commander sgt. Barnes (Berenger) and good-natured but utterly disenchanted sgt. Elias (Dafoe).
                                            60. 1988: The Last Emperor                                        
Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor surveys the story of a man who is shackled by his past. The Chinese Emperor Pu Yi (John Lone) inherits the throne as a little boy and is forced to live incarcerated in the Forbidden City. This is a profound film about how politics can affect not only the masses, but an unusual person too. It won nine Academy Awards.
                                            61. 1989: Rain Man                                        
Probably the most famous fictional savant is Raymond, Dustin Hoffman's character in the 1988 film Rain Man. Raymond was based on a real-life person called Kim Peek who, despite having an IQ measuring just 72 (below normal), had a stunning memory.
Rain Man was heralded by viewers and critics alike, winning the Golden Bear at the 39th Berlin Film Festival, four Academy Awards, and taking $350 million at the box office.
                                            62. 1990: Driving Miss Daisy                                        
Based on Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Driving Miss Daisy traces the quarter-century long relationship between a Black chauffeur, Hoke (Morgan Freeman) and a matriarchal Southerner Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy).
This is a complex and compelling portrait of old age, dealing with the thorny issue of race. It received nine nominations, winning four for Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Makeup, and Best Adapted Screenplay.
                                            63. 1991: Dances With Wolves                                        
Epic, sprawling 181-minute films don't tend to be the stuff of Best Picture winners, though star actor-cum-director Kevin Costner's filmmaking debut was not your average blockbuster.
Set in the 1860s, Dances with Wolves ostensibly follows Costner's First Lieutenant John J. Dunbar, who is wounded in the midst of the American Civil War, yet it contains much more: with a relatively frugal $19 million budget, the film features 300 horses, 3,500 buffalo, 250 Native Americans, 150 cavalry, and 48 speaking roles.
                                            64. 1992: The Silence of the Lambs                                        
The Silence of the Lambs won all 'Big Five' Academy Awards at the 1992 Oscar ceremony and was one of the biggest grossing films of 1991 thanks in part to Jonathan Demme's direction and Ted Tally's adaptation of Thomas Harris' second Hannibal Lecter novel.
It was the performances of the two lead actors though-Jodie Foster, and in particular, Anthony Hopkins as Lecter-which really grabbed the imagination and eventually earned the movie, after a slow start, widespread acclaim.
                                            65. 1993: Unforgiven                                        
Starring, produced and directed by Clint Eastwood , Unforgiven ranks fourth in the American Film Institute's best Westerns of all time. When a sex worker is attacked by two cowboys in the town of Big Whisky, a bounty is put on their heads. William Munny (Eastwood), a one-time outlaw, takes himself out of retirement for one last job.
The film was intended to be a last hurrah before Eastwood stopped creating Westerns, but the old gunslinger returned in 2014 with the controversial American Sniper, a traditional Western set on the battlegrounds of the Middle East.
                                            66. 1994: Schindler's List                                        
Steven Spielberg's masterpiece about Nazi Poland almost had another director. Though interested in the real life story of Oskar Schindler, he didn't believe he was ready to tackle the subject matter, and tried to pass it on to other directors. How lucky for us that none of the other possibilities took it!
Schindler (Liam Neeson ), a wealthy Nazi businessman, comes to Kraków to set up a munitions factory, employing cheap labour from the city's Jewish ghetto. When an SS overseer (Ralph Fiennes ) is ordered to move Jews to a concentration camp, Schindler witnesses the extent of Nazi brutality, and begins to devote himself to keeping as many Jews alive as possible.
The American Film Institute puts it in the top ten greatest American films.
                                            67. 1995: Forrest Gump                                        
This epic begins with a man sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus and telling strangers his life story. The man is Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks ), eminently quotable for a generation of cinema-goers, and his life features cameos from some of the century's leading figures, from Richard Nixon and JFK to Elvis and John Lennon.
A boy of below average intelligence with a good heart, he discovers early that he is a naturally gifted athlete, and later makes a brave soldier in Vietnam.
The film took six Oscars and to this day divides critics, with half finding it heart-warming, and others finding it a little too sentimental.
                                            68. 1996: Braveheart                                        
After the Medieval King of England Edward I's conquest of Scotland, English lords took increasing liberties over the Scottish people. After his wife was executed for refusing to sleep with an English lord, William Wallace takes vengeance, and becomes a beacon of hope to Scottish patriots.
Though famously taking many liberties with historical fact, this epic boosted tourism to Scotland, and even increased Scottish people's engagement with that period of their history.
                                            69. 1997: The English Patient                                        
Based on the Booker Prize-winning novel by Michael Ondaatje, The English Patient won nine Academy Awards.
Set in Italy during WWII, it explores the relationship of a French-Canadian nurse (Juliette Binoche) to her badly disfigured patient, Count Laszlo de Almásy (Ralph Fiennes) who relives his memories of the war in a series of flashbacks.
The author was consulted by the film editor Walter Murch on how to achieve the complex play between timeframes, spawning a book based on these conversations.
                                            70. 1998: Titanic                                        
James Cameron's epic romantic disaster film set on the ill-fated british passenger liner RMS Titanic stood as the most popular film in box office history, grossing over $2 billion. It was only topped by Cameron himself, with Avatar in 2009.
The all-conquering tragic romance between Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Leonardo DiCaprio  and Kate Winslet) was an entirely fictionalised account, however there was a J. Dawson aboard the original ship.
It won 11 Oscars, tying with Ben-Hur (1959) and Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King (2003) as the most Oscars won for a single film.
                                            71. 1999: Shakespeare in Love                                        
John Madden's romantic comedy about William Shakespeare  stars Joseph Fiennes as the struggling poet and playwright searching for a muse. This he finds in the form of Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow), a passionate actor auditioning for all-male casts in the guise of Thomas Kent.
The eighth British film to ever win Best Picture, it featured Judi Dench as Elizabeth I and Colin Firth as Lord Wessex. It scooped 7 Oscars in all, with Paltrow and Dench securing best actress and supporting actress.
                                            72. 2000: American Beauty                                        
Sam Mendes' suburban drama starring Kevin Spacey  as a father in the grips of a midlife crisis makes him the most recent of only six directors to ever win Best Picture on their cinematic debut.
Lester Burnham (Spacey), ever more depressed and estranged from family life, becomes infatuated with his daughter's best friend Angela (Mena Suvari).
The film won five Oscars including Best Actor for Kevin Spacey, and beat The Green Mile to Best Picture.
                                            73. 2001: Gladiator                                        
Russell Crowe  plays Maximus, a Roman army general in the year 180. The subsequent chaos after the death of Marcus Aurelius leads to him being sentenced to execution, and losing all his wealth and status. He escapes and becomes a gladiator, determined to avenge himself against Aurelius' son and return himself to his former glory.
The epic production was a hit at the worldwide box office, being topped only by Mission Impossible: II.
                                            74. 2002: A Beautiful Mind                                        
Based loosely on the biography of nobel-prize winning mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., A Beautiful Mind charts his meteoric rise and initial promise studying at Princeton in the 1940s, to his Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994. In between he suffers highs and lows, dealing with his asocial tendencies and schizophrenia.
Jennifer Connelly won Best Supporting actress for her role as his student and later wife, Alicia, and the film earned Ron Howard his first Best Director Oscar.
                                            75. 2003: Chicago                                        
Director Rob Marshall's Chicago is a hard-edged Prohibition-era city far from the one depicted in High Fidelity two years before. Killers on the run Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger), however, charm their way to the top - and away from death row - by becoming Vaudeville stars.
Adapted by screenwriter Bill Condon, Chicago won six Academy Awards in 2003, including Best Picture (the first musical to win Best Picture since Oliver! in 1969).
                                            76. 2004: The Lord of the Rings-Return of the King                                        
The Lord of the Rings trilogy was probably the greatest gamble in filmmaking history. Executives at New Line Cinema risked the entire studio by giving Peter Jackson - a New Zealander known mainly for a handful of zombie films and the real-life drama Heavenly Creatures - $300 million and a free hand to make all three films at once.
The denouement to JRR Tolkien's trilogy, however, turned out to be Jackson's favourite, and the one that finally scooped a Best Picture Oscar for its troubles.
                                            77. 2005: Million Dollar Baby                                        
Actor-director Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie Dunn, a virtuoso veteran trainer, who one day takes on pocket-rocket Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). The screenplay was written by Paul Haggis, and loosely based on a series of short stories by the former fight manager Jerry Boyd.
                                            78. 2006: Crash                                        
Not to be mistaken for David Cronenberg's psychological thriller of the same name, writer-director Paul Haggis's Crash is about a handful of Los Angeles residents, whose trajectories come to collide in a 36-hour period.
The city is amid a race relation storm, playing on racial and identity politics, as a Caucasian district attorney and his wife are carjacked by two black men.
The film received six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Paul Haggis.
                                            79. 2007: The Departed                                        
Martin Scorsese continued his domination of the Oscars with this bloody remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, with young undercover policeman Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by Irish gang chief Frank Costello. It was not immediately considered an Oscar contender due to its graphic violent content, though many credited its heavyweight PR campaign for the eventual victory (the film's budget was $90 million).
                                            80. 2008: No Country for Old Men                                        
This Coen Brothers film, for many critics, established the directors as among the very best. Shot in the arid badlands of Texas, it is an up-to-date incarnation of the Western.
After stumbling across a bag of money, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is hunted by the assassin Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), one of the scariest characters in modern cinema, who flips a coin to decide whether he will kill people he meets along the way.
Watching it, for many, was a truly gripping and unsettling experience, leading some to say that Alfred Hitchcock himself couldn't have made it more menacing.
                                            81. 2009: Slumdog Millionaire                                        
Having done brilliantly on the gameshow Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Jamal (Dev Patel), a teenage boy from the slums of Mumbai, must prove he hasn't cheated. Questioned by police backstage before the final question, he details how he knows every answer, and in explaining tells the story of his life: from picking pockets, his gangster brother who worked his way out of the slums, and the love of his life.
Danny Boyle's film met praise across the board from audiences, though many Indian critics found it patronising, saying it showcased only the bad parts of Mumbai and Indian cinema.
                                            82. 2010: The Hurt Locker                                        
"Every time you suit up," says one bomb disposal expert to another, "it's life or death."
Sergeant First Class William James is brought in to head up an Explosive Ordnance Disposal team in Iraq after his predecessor is blown up. A man who loves the adrenaline of his job more than anything else in his life, his colleagues fear him. But when he believes a local child has been killed, he takes his team on a private war.
With The Hurt Locker, Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win Best Director. Strangely, it is the "lowest-grossing movie to ever win Best Picture."
                                            83. 2011: The King's Speech                                        
The charismatic King Edward VIII is provoking scandal by courting a divorced woman, and his brother, the shy and stuttering Prince Albert (Colin Firth), might have to replace him. He is persuaded to see a speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), and so begins an unlikely and life-long friendship.
Veteran Hollywood screenwriter David Seidler tracked down the son of Logue and was shown his notebooks, but in order to write about what he found he needed permission from the Queen Mother, who requested that he wait till after her death. This uplifting film bagged a Best Actor award for English darling Colin Firth.
                                            84. 2012: The Artist                                        
The Artist is a modern silent film, depicting the point in the late Twenties when silent films fell out of vogue. George Valentine (Jean Dujardin) is a Hollywood star at the height of his fame, when a chance meeting leads to him helping out the career of Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), an aspiring dancer and actress.
Their two trajectories pass as Valentine refuses to take part in the new 'talkies,' and Miller becomes the bigger star. As Valentine eventually comes round to the idea of talkies, the film becomes one.
Jean Dujardin became the first French actor to receive a Best Actor award.
                                            85. 2013: Argo                                        
Based on a true CIA covert operation which was unknown to the public for years, Argo tells the story of CIA 'exfiltration' expert Tony Mendez, in his attempt to smuggle six Americans out of Iran during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979, under the guise of a Hollywood film producer.
Starring, produced and directed by Ben Affleck , the film won awards for Writing, Editing and Screenplay. In order to make it look authentically 1970s, it was shot on traditional film, with each frame being cut and then blown up to increase graininess.
                                            86. 2014: 12 Years a Slave                                        
Adapted from Solomon Northrup's 1853 memoir of the same title, 12 Years a Slave tells the harrowing tale of an African-American musician living in New York State, who is kidnapped, put on the slave-market in Louisiana, and sold to a plantation.
Steve McQueen's third feature film, it is the first film directed by a black filmmaker to have won Best Picture. Best Supporting Actress also went to Lupita Nyong'o for her role as Patsey. 
                                            87. 2015: Birdman

'Parasite' is an art directed South Korean movie. About an underemployed family of hustlers who inveigle themselves into a posh home to escape from their working class backgrounds, the movie is set in two houses.
The first is where the Kim family - father, mother, son and daughter - live. Half the tiny apartment is below the road, and the other is above. This allows the foursome to be seen by, and to see, the public. There is no privacy, naturally, in this hovel, and every night they watch drunks urinate on the wall opposite, and can do little about it except yell and fight. When it rains and the road floods, the water, and the sewage along with it, pours in. It is a miserable existence and they are desperate to earn regular money and move to a better place.
Through a contact of the son, Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the family engineer themselves, one by one, into the employment of the wealthy Park family - also father, mother, son and daughter - who live in a rich neighbourhood of the city. The house is a stunner, built, we are told, by an architect called 'Namgoong'. This is fiction, of course, and in reality it is a set, built by the director and production designer.
The house has a manicured garden that you can view through a massive, single pane of glass, along with a glass door. The bedrooms are upstairs, but there is another secret level to the house, a cellar, more like Hitler's self sufficient bunker in his last days in Berlin, that the ubiquitous 'Namgoong' apparently built to stay safe from a possible North Korean nuclear attack.
The film is funny, sad and unpredictable in narrative, but too obviously schematic in design. The storied architecture of the sets explains the skewed class structure of South Korea, and indeed any nation that has turned capitalist with a vengeance. A small percentage of the population controls almost all the wealth, and most people, like the Kims, live in poverty.
The rich Parks can afford to employ them; as driver, housekeeper and tutors to their children. But once in this luxurious and beautifully decorated home, the servants are left free to exercise a moral code. Do they remain exploited, with wages that are a tiny fraction of that earned by their corporate employers? Do they allow themselves to be hired and fired on a whim, tossed out into the rain without social security? Or do they turn parasite, and feed on those who feed them?
Director Bong Joon-ho loads his film with allegories and symbols - the internet versus morse code, the scholar's rock versus the murderer's rock, books versus paintings, sex versus death, ghost versus reality, North versus South Korea - that gives 'Parasite' the kinetic energy that keeps you engrossed. But it also has the effect of turning the movie into a self conscious work. This takes away from the naturalism of an earlier engrossing movie by this gifted director - 'Memories of Murder' - a film about the social and political impact of a serial killer in Korea.
Still, 'Parasite' is a recommended watch.

Oct 31, 2019( Louis Proyect: The Unrepentant Marxist: http://louisproyect.wordpress.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Play Video[1]A month ago, I asked my NYFCO colleague Avi Offer if he could recommend any films that might pass muster for our year-end awards given my stringent standards. Avi is generally pretty sharp. For example, he wrote about Tarantino's 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood': 'If Tarantino had something insightful to say about Hollywood or actors or humanity instead of wasting the audience's time with shots of people's feet and other shallow, dull and boring scenes then the film would be much more powerful, provocative, haunting and even poignant.' I couldn't put it better. 
After a minute or so, he told me that 'Parasite' was very good. I told him that I liked Bong Joon Ho's 'The Host' very much but didn't care for later films like 'Snowpiercer' or 'Okja' very much. In fact, I walked out of press screenings for both after about 20 minutes. Since he assured me that 'Parasite' was a return to the high standards of 'The Host', I thought I'd give it a chance. Well, it was better than 'Snowpiercer' or 'Okja' but only in the sense that I walked out of a press screening after 40 minutes this time. This is not meant as a review but only a reaction to what I saw. You can take it with a grain of salt, but for those who tend to agree with my film reviews, this is probably sufficient to warn you off. This is a story about a down-and-out family living in a bug-infested apartment that takes advantage of a super-rich but nave Korean family. The father in the down-and-out family is played by Kang-ho Song, who has been in many Korean films playing a likable but oafish anti-hero. His wife is sort of his female counterpart. They have one male and one female college-aged children, slackers just like the parents. The son's best friend urges him to interview for a tutoring job working with the attractive teen daughter of the rich family since he trusts him not to put the make on her. To help him qualify, his sister uses Photoshop to produce a false credentials establishing him as a college student and tutor. In short order, we learn that the entire family is made up of grifters. On his first day on the job, he manages to sweep the teen daughter of the rich family off her feet. While he is at their opulent townhouse, he notices that her younger brother is an out of control brat with a passion for making ugly self-portraits. This inspires him to recommend his sister for a job as the kid's art therapist, pretending that she is a friend of a friend who has been studying in the USA. She uses Photoshop to create phony credentials for herself as well and manages to con the mother into hiring her but at a top dollar. Understanding that the mother is an easy con, they conspire to replace the family chauffeur with their father and the long-time housekeeper with the mom. To get the current chauffeur fired, the sister pulls off her panties as he is driving her home and leaves it on the floor of the back seat, the intention being to make it look like he has been having sex on the job. This is now about 30 minutes into the film and I am starting to feel restless. The rich people are patsies and the poor people are there to suck them dry. Like parasites, I suppose. Of all the characters I have seen to that point, none are likable. In fact, they are uniformly repellent. The straw that broke the camel's back was how they got rid of the housekeeper. After they learned that she was allergic to peaches, they began shaving off the fuzz from peaches and dropping them on the back of her neck when she wasn't looking. The fuzz made her have huge coughing attacks, kind of like the bronchitis that has been hobbling me until 3 or 4 days ago. When she goes to a clinic to get treated, the poor family's father takes a photo of her there and informs the rich family's father that she has TB just to get her fired. I sat in my plush screening room seat and scratched my head. Peach fuzz causing coughing attacks? WTF? And she is going to be fired without the rich family giving her the right to show them the results of a test from the clinic that would certainly not indicate TB? I tried to picture myself as a producer working on the film and reading the script. I'd ask Bong Joon Ho how he came up with such a cockamamie plot twist. Needless to say, with his clout he'd find a producer to replace me on the spot. That's the problem with all these celebrated writer/directors like Tarantino and Bong Joon Ho. Nobody has the guts to tell the studio that the emperor is not wearing any clothes. Although I have not seen 'Joker' yet, I have a feeling that the two films have this much in common. They are supposed to be about class warfare but hardly having anything to do with the sort of film a John Sayles or a Gillo Pontecorvo would make. Seeing that 'Parasite' had a fresh rating of 99 percent on Rotten Tomatoes (I won't be posting a review since I walked out), I was curious to see who the dissidents were. Ironically, there were only two and both were members of NYFCO. One was a hard-core Stalinist named Prairie Miller who had (or maybe still has) a show on WBAI where I used to make guest appearances. All that came to an end after I started writing articles supporting the overthrow of Assad. Now she won't even speak to me, even at our yearly awards meeting. In any case, I think she got the film right[2]: Though billed as a kind of South Korean anti-capitalism satire - this eat the rich outing when not eating its own at the bottom of the economic food chain, comes off more as an empty plate A somewhat combo tale of two families and exceedingly twisted prince and the pauper dubious Seoul mates turned sour spree, Parasite plays out as the poverty stricken bottom feeder (literally basement dwellers) Kim clan conspires together to pull off an elaborate scheme posing as hired help at the home of the patrician Park family. All goes well until part of the ploy involving maneuvers to get rid of the existing household workers backfires into over the top mayhem. And as a kind of chaotic both external and internal bloody class warfare ensues. Essentially creating for the amusement of the giddy bourgeois popcorn audience - both consumers and critics - a cinematic 21st century gladiator spree. The other 'rotten' review came from Armond White, the gay African-American conservative who used to be the president of the prestigious NY Film Critics Circle. Later on, he was expelled for heckling Steve McQueen, the director of '12 Years a Slave', at their annual awards meeting. In his review, White denounced the film as 'torture porn.' In my review,[3] I shared White's take: As is the case with 'Django Unchained', McQueen's film is a vehicle for his preoccupations. With Tarantino, these primarily revolve around revenge, a theme common to so many of the Hong Kong gangster or samurai movies that he has absorbed. For McQueen, the chief interest is in depicting pain with some of the most dramatic scenes involving whippings and other forms of punishment. Although I can't stand White's politics, I think he is one of the sharper film critics around. Indeed, despite his rightwing fanaticism, his critique[4] of 'Parasite' overlaps with Miller's: 'Bong wants his politics both ways: targeting and humiliating the wealthy, high-living entrepreneurs while sentimentalizing and sympathizing with the dishonest, corrupt agitators who angle to swindle them.' If I wrote a full review, this is what I would focus on. The totally misanthropic view that both the rich and poor are shit. 'Snowpiercer' was widely acclaimed as a 'radical' film set on a train in which rich and poor, once again, are at each other's throats. In the 20 minutes I sat watching it, I could not detect a shred of leftist politics. Slant Magazine, a source of some of the most insightful film reviews (music, TV as well), was not impressed. The review[5] ended on this note: 'Snowpiercer concludes on a irritatingly reassuring high note that suggests, per usual, that killing one bad man will allow all of falsely indoctrinated society to magically correct itself. The film could be a conservative parody of nave liberal piety, if conservatives were known to exhibit a sense of humor.'

Parasite review: An intricate examination of class conflict; Director Bong Joon-ho will make you feel at home, then rip the rug out from under you

                     Dir: Bong Joon-ho. Starring: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam. 15 cert, 132 mins                   
The world can seem a very different place depending on the window you're looking out of. Out of their stinkbug and mildew-infested basement apartment, the Kim family sees steel bars. Beyond that, one of Seoul's backstreets - the kind that drunks dive into to relieve themselves. When the street fumigators go by, they leave their windows open so their apartment can be treated for free, even if they nearly choke to death in the process. Then there's the Park family, settled in a quiet suburban home that's halfway between an art installation and a fortress. Half the walls are made of glass, offering a clear view of the acid-green lawn outside and the vegetation that encloses it on all sides. It's a vista of immense serenity, safety, and eerie perfection. 
The Park patriarch Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) is a tech CEO who's barely home, while his wife Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) is fluttery and fragile. She obsesses over the imagined artistic genius of her son. He specialises in angry, rebellious scribbles. Toy dogs keep appearing out of nowhere. Are they multiplying in secret? 
It's into this shiny, hollow world that the Kim family try to integrate themselves, after the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is hired as an English-language tutor. He immediately hatches a plan to get the rest of the clan - which comprises his parents, Ki-taek (veteran actor Song Kang-ho) and Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin), as well as his sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) - employed. Their schemes are exhilarating, as clever and intricately plotted as they are mildly preposterous. For much of Bong           Joon-ho's            Parasite, which the director co-wrote with Han Jin-won, the audience is swept up in the heady thrill of the con. We see them forge documents, invent aliases, and carefully rehearse their lines. 
                     But Bong has never made a straightforward film in his life - that's why he's one of the great masters of the cinematic game (his awards recognition is long overdue, with Parasite landing six Oscar nominations). The director's work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. He'll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you. As his takes on the monster movie (2006's The Host) and dystopian fantasy (2013's Snowpiercer) already proved, the director has an affinity for genre cinema, but has never felt confined by its rules. Parasite doesn't quite take place in our world, but neither is it fantasy. It happens in a world that would exist if people's desires and motivations weren't stuffed below the surface.
The director's always shown an interest in class conflict. The train in Snowpiercer is just one big metaphor for capitalism, after all. But Parasite might be his most intricate examination of the topic so far. The "parasite" of the title applies to every character in this film; the rich leech off the poor, who in turn survive by attaching themselves to the underbelly of the ruling class. 
Everyone's fixated on transforming into something else: the Kim family give themselves new backstories that involve fancy foreign colleges and elite skill sets. Yeon-gyo is obsessed with American culture (the most capitalist of them all), importing Native American-style toys for her son and declaring he's the next Basquiat. In Parasite, capitalism is an illusion piled onto another illusion, with everyone trampling each other to reach some undefined goal. 
Much of this story, however, isn't told in words, but in the use of space and the way people move through it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture and fittings so they can all fit. They're a united front in this battle. The Park family, meanwhile, always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame. No wonder they're so weak and easily manipulated. 
But, be warned: there are no victories in Parasite. And no one gets away scot-free.

Bong Joon Ho Says 'Parasite' Series Would Expand World of His Film - Not Remake It

Bong Joon Ho has more to say when it comes to "Parasite" and he believes a limited television series is the way to do it.
Moments after the Academy Awards announced four nominations for "Parasite" (original screenplay, foreign language film, best director and best picture) the director hopped on the phone with Variety to discuss the film's global success and potential future beyond film.
"When I think of a limited series, I really think of it as an expanded film. Like Ingmar Bergman's 'Fanny and Alexander,' you have a three-hour theatrical version and a three-hour TV version. So my goal is to create a high quality an expanded version of 'Parasite,'" Bong explained via an interpreter.
The news that Bong was teaming up with Adam McKay to create the series for HBO, broke in early January.
"Adam McKay and            HBO did very well with 'Succession,' to work with these artists who have created great works I would like to actualize this attempt to expand this film and explore all the ideas that I've had from the script writing stage from what could happen in between the scenes through the TV series," Bong said.
Bong insists he and McKay haven't decided if the series will be set in South Korea or be an English language adaptation. "We're still very much in the early stages," he said. "I'll soon meet with Adam to talk about the set up. For now, a lot of things are open."
"Parasite" made history this morning when it became the first South Korean movie to be nominated for best picture and best international film. Bong also earned a nod for directoras well original screenplay with Jon Won Han. Jinmo Yang earned a nom for editing while Lee Ha Jun and Cho Won Woo are up for production design.
"I didn't create this film for all these nominations but somehow this all happened. I was particularly happy to get the craft nominations for editing and production design," Bong said. "They are all great masters with a long career and I was very happy to see them nominated... We put in so much effort in all departments for this film. We tried to approach it with mastery and artistry and with new challenges and not remain complacent and I think the voters really recognized that as fellow filmmakers."

Korea's Latest Cinematic Treasure: Parasite Movie Review

In light of the incoming 92nd Academy Awards on Feb. 9, Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite" has caught attention as not just the only foreign nominee for Best Picture, but the first Korean nominee ever considered for the award. The film's six Oscars nominations speak to its historic success, cementing Joon-ho's work as a masterpiece.  
The title of the movie is somewhat misleading. Labeled as a thriller by cinemas, "Parasite" appears simply to be about an infectious disease. But as the movie evolves, the name reveals itself to be but a metaphor.
"Parasite" follows the footsteps of two families, the Kims and the Parks, representing two opposite classes in every society. The Parks are so rich that they do not know how many rooms there are in their house; the Kims are so poor that they sit in their bathroom to catch Wi-Fi from a nearby café. Destiny somehow connects the two together, leading to the least expected events for both families.
In every scene, Joon-ho uses this striking parallel narrative to emphasize the social status among members of two families. Their discrepancies are delicately depicted through their encounters. Characters rarely talk about their wealth gap, but every line is a blast for viewers. My favorite line is Mrs. Kim's comment on the Parks: "There are no good and rich people. They are good because they are rich."
Just as two families' lives are extremely different, "Parasite's" first and second halves take very different tones. The first half is what every viewer can expect of a satirical comedy. The Kims bring the playful element to the film with their ridiculously crafty plan and dark jokes. But it is just the set-up for the latter half. The tone changes completely as more secrets are revealed, leading to a bloody ending, reminding me of the Oscars-winning "American Beauty" by Sam Mendes.
The brilliancy of "Parasite" lies in the plot. The film's storyline is so incredibly cohesive that all the details are connected with and complementary to each other. Even simple things like Mr. Park's cup of coffee or the dim light bulb tell a story. This is the artistry that makes the film both overdramatic and logical at the same time.
"Parasite's" sensational story is paired with an equally impressive cast. Lee Sun Kyung, Choi Woo-shik, and Kang Ho-song all make their roles memorable, but for me, the most stunning performance is by Park So-dam as Kim Ki-Jung. Her character is so mysterious that even by the end of the film, her intentions are ambiguous. Her acts are full of conflict of confusion: lighting a cigarette underwater, or smiling in life-threatening situations. Her intricacy and unpredictability reflect that of the entire film
Along with the cast, music in the film contributes to its success. Beautiful symphonies in the first half of the film highlight the harmony reflected in the characters and plot. But as the film turns darker, it ditches its light, romantic film score, growing darker and more dramatic.
Between its masterful story, narrative, cast, and music, "Parasite" is more than just a good movie. It has proven its stand in the film industry, winning the Golden Palm (highest award) in 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It will be no surprise if Joon-ho and his crew bring home some awards in the upcoming Oscars.

Will 'Parasite' Work as an HBO Miniseries? (Column)
Variety
January 12, 2020

There's a time-honored tradition of turning celebrated movies into television series. A lot of them have ended up as sitcoms: "The Odd Couple," "M*A*S*H," "Alice" (spun out of Martin Scorsese's 1974 landmark "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"). But not all of them. Did you know that "Casablanca" was turned into two different TV series, one in 1955 and one in 1983? (The latter starred David Soul as Rick Blaine!) In 1976, they tried it with "Serpico." Sometimes, a series can seem a true extension of the movie it's adapted from - that's what happened with "Fargo" and "Dear White People." Sometimes, the movie that spawned a series will come to seem a mere footnote to the show - that's what happened with "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Friday Night Lights." And in the case of "Parenthood" (though it took two tries to get it right), a movie can be turned into an ideal show because it was always TV at heart.
But even given the vast history of movies-into-television, the announcement last week that "Parasite," Bong Joon Ho's deliriously ambitious, wildly acclaimed, staggeringly popular South Korean sociological thriller, would now be converted into a limited series for            HBO, with Bong and Adam McKay teaming up as executive producers, has to count as a total eyebrow-raiser. And part of what's eyebrow-raising about it is that the news didn't raise more eyebrows. It barely raised a shrug.
One of the headiest, most lavishly praised foreign-language films of its era gets remade, just like that, into a miniseries. (And we don't even know yet how it will do at the Oscars!) "Parasite," as a movie, has only begun to carve out its place in the culture, yet the idea that its story, its substance, its themes, its metaphors, its very form is already an utterly malleable thing is a very 21st-century concept. There's a refreshing lack of pretension to the idea. This isn't about Bong Joon Ho sweating whether his film gets etched onto a monument of canonical reverence. It's about Bong, even at the moment he's being saluted around the world as a newly preeminent maestro, stepping off the pedestal and going with the media flow.
I say more power to him. But to ask a genuinely unprecedented question: What will the HBO version of a movie like "           Parasite" look like? More to the point: What does it portend for the future?
Given the rarefied atmosphere of prestige that a film like "Parasite" occupies (the Palme d'Or at Cannes; the rave reviews, top spots on 10 Best lists, and bevy of year-end critics'-group awards; the Golden Globes kudo; the slew of Oscar nominations that will surely greet it tomorrow morning; the rising number of people who think that it has a genuine shot to win best picture), it's hard to consider the potential HBO version of "Parasite" without cracking a few obligatory dislocating jokes.
As in...what's next? A 12-chapter Netflix soap opera entitled "Roma: Another Year," which traces the further adventures of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio) and the Mexico City family she works for, though Cleo herself utters only three lines of dialogue per episode? "Life Is Beautiful...Everywhere," in which Robert Benigni stars as a rotating series of international bumpkins, each one imprisoned by the forces of his homeland (Bosnia, Iran, Brazil, China), and by the end of each episode you'll be smiling through your tears of political outrage? Or how about "Two Days, One Night: Marxist Apprentice," in which the Dardenne brothers adapt their celebrated 2014 drama into a highly austere reality series, where contestants have just 36 hours to bring social justice to their workplaces?
Okay, I'll stop. But the point is: How often has a film as singular and as deadly serious as "Parasite" been wedged into the small screen? All but never, if you consider that a sitcom like "M*A*S*H" didn't pretend to be the subversive comic hand grenade that Robert Altman's movie was (Altman, aghast at the idea, claimed to have never watched the show). That said, there's a galaxy of difference between a network series and an HBO miniseries, which really can feel like a movie. I assume that "Parasite," though the precise details of the series have yet to be released or maybe even nailed down, will tell the same essential story the movie tells, probably now set in an American city (San Francisco? Boston? Portland?), and will expand and enrich the narrative.
If I shared the opinion of many of my critical colleagues that "Parasite" is, quite simply, the movie of the year, then I'd probably, on a basic level, object to this project. After all, why mess with perfection? But I'm personally attracted to the prospect of the HBO "Parasite" precisely because I thought the film was good rather than great. I had an issue with it, one that many viewers I've spoken to share. The first half, in which the members of the down-and-out Kim family in Seoul infiltrate the much wealthier home of the Park family, pretending to be tutors and servants, all so that they can revel in the luxury of living in that posh enclave, is devious Hitchcockian bliss. It's a suspense tale that's also a highly sensualized parable of vengeful class envy.
But as I watch "Parasite," I'm disappointed, on some primal childlike level, when the ingenious deception the Kim family has orchestrated begins to fall apart. It happens too quickly; I want it to go on! As soon as the film moves into that basement bunker, where the Parks' former housekeeper's husband lives, I feel like the movie's dirty joy starts to seep out of it. It becomes what it probably, in a sense, always was - a dark didactic illustration of the competing rage of the haves and the have-nots. In the HBO version, Bong, I suspect, will have greater freedom to revel in the sheer playacting fantasy that gives "Parasite" its charge. I could definitely use another hour or two of that.
The best description I've read of "Parasite" comes from the director Paul Schrader, who in a Facebook post said that the movie starts off as Buñuel and ends up as Tarantino (weapons, blood, life gone gonzo). Maybe that's the trend this year. ("Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" starts as Tarantino and ends as Herschell Gordon Lewis.) And maybe the HBO "Parasite" will just be a more padded, less essential cover version of the same thing. In our binge-watching era, when too many people glibly sanctify the "superiority" of series television, I always say: There isn't a single great movie of the last 100 years that needed to be a minute longer. So why make "Parasite" several hours longer? Because, just maybe, it's an experiment that can poke at the possibilities of the new synergy of movies and television. And can do something gripping with them. And can demonstrate that what we once thought of as a "foreign film" may not be a foreign film at all. The tagline for the new "Parasite" could almost be: It's not cinema. It's HBO.

Alright. Don't say I didn't warn you. Ahem.
"Parasite" is a darkly comedic, socially satirical film from accomplished writer and director Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Okja, The Host). Released on May 30, 2019 in South Korea, then October 5 of the same year in the USA, "Parasite" went on to win a litany of awards, including Academy Award for Best Picture.
As a student of film, I find myself constantly unable to turn off "filmmaker brain" while watching movies. Analysis of shots, scenery, dialogue and other narrative aspects are always smacking me in the face while I try to enjoy a good story. "Parasite" kidnaps filmmaker brain and holds it hostage for its 2 hour and 12 minute runtime. 
We are immediately dropped in on the Kim family; a brother, sister and their parents of less-than-ideal wealth. Ki-woo, the brother, has connections and friendship to collegiate Min-hyuk, an English tutor. Min-hyuk works for the Park family, a well-endowed and affluent family household. The film's inciting incident occurs when Min-hyuk asks Ki-woo to tutor the Park's eldest daughter, Da-hye, while he is abroad. Shortly after, Min-hyuk stops in on the Kim's dinner and presents them a gift: a scholar's rock. A gift of Min-hyuk's grandfathers, the scholar's rock is prophesied to bring good wealth (something the Kim's could definitely benefit from). With the gift of the scholar's rock, Ki-woo forges his way into the Park household.
As Ki-woo (referred to as "Kevin" in the Park household) begins his teachings, he realizes the oblivity of the matriarch of the Park household. Through this oblivity, Ki-woo is able to deceive the Park family into hiring his entire family as various talented - yet completely unrelated - houseworkers. 
Ki-woo's sister, Ki-jung is onboarded (codename "Jessica", a friend from Chicago) as an art therapist for the Park's hyperactive son, Da-song. Ki-jung, the one who created Ki-woo's forged college documents, is rather sly and cunning. She uses these skills to frame the Park's chauffeur into termination, paving the road for their father Ki-taek to take over as the family's driver. 
Finally, the three Kims (disguised, so the Parks won't be able to tell they're related) take advantage of the health of the Park's housekeeper Moon-gwang, falsifying a case of tuberculosis. The oblivious matriarch and her married-for-business husband both agree they cannot have a case of TB around their young son, and terminate Moon-gwang's position immediately. Now, the void left by Moon-gwang can be filled by the final member of the Kim entourage, Chung-sook. The Kim's have now officially infiltrated the Park household, and are climbing their own bootleg ladder in escape from their destitute semi-basement apartment.
After the Kims have stormed the Park castle, they make efforts to disguise their related identities. Because of Da-songs upcoming birthday, the Park's take him camping as a family, leaving the house for upwards of a week. For context, Da-song is in poor health. During one of his previous birthdays, Da-song had an encounter with a ghost from the basement, and now suffers from grand-mal seizures. Thanks to this trauma, the Park's now only celebrate Da-song's birthdays outdoors.
With the Park nest left empty, the Kims all live in parasitic luxury in the Park's home. Drinking, celebrating and generally disrespecting, the Kims are eating up their new access to luxury and applaud their excellent charade. 
However, the peace is shattered when the doorbell rings.
At the door is Moon-gwang, the previous housekeeper. She's simply requesting she be let in to retrieve something from the basement. She was rushed out in a flurry, after all.
Chung-sook tentatively allows Moon-gwang entry, while the remaining Kims hide out of sight in the living room. Moon-gwang disappears into the basement. After some time, Chung-sook descends into the ominous food storage basement, to find Moon-gwang struggling to open the door to a secret underground bunker. 
This is where the film completely switches gears. And maybe, you might want to pause on this review and watch the movie, if you don't want the events potentially spoiled. It's on Hulu!
Chung-sook secretly follows Moon-gwang into the depths of the bunker, to find the housekeeper's husband Geun-sae, hiding from loan sharks. Chung-sook is appalled to discover this, threatening to report Moon-gwang to the Parks.
Moving back, the remaining Kims are curious as to where Chung-sook and Moon-gwang have been for so long. They go down to the basement to discover the open door. 
The remaining Kims also descend into the hidden bunker.
Flashforward, Chung-sook's interrogation is interrupted by the remaining Kims falling into a crumpled heap behind her. You can cut the tension with a knife in this scene. Moon-gwang nabs Chung-sooks cellphone and records Ki-woo referring to Ki-taek as father. The ruse is shattered on digital video.
After this standoff, the Kims head back upstairs to a ringing phone. Moon-gwang and Geun-sae are at this point, trapped in the bunker.
On the other end of the phone are the Parks.
On their way home.
Within ten minutes.
The Kims narrowly escape their employers home, and return to their (now flooded) apartment. The Kims spend the night in a gymnasium, filled with other displaced persons.
Joon Ho's narrative comes to its peak the next day, at Da-song's outdoor backyard birthday. Ki-woo takes the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae, to no avail. Geun-sae, gone stark-crazy and filled with rage, makes his way upstairs to the outdoor party. It's revealed that the "ghost" Da-song saw years ago, was Geun-sae emerging eerily from the basement. This prompts another Da-song seizure. 
During this seizure, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung in the chest as revenge for threatening his wife, and Geun-sae perishes at the hands of Chung-sook's barbeque stake. Amidst this nightmare, Mr. Park demands Ki-taek's chauffeur character to drive Da-song to the hospital, citing only minutes to act.
Then, an extra layer is presented.
At this moment, Mr. Park's rich and affluent nose causes him to retch at the "poor" scent on Ki-taek's clothes, a scent shared amongst all the Kim parasites. Ki-taek notices this intense judgement from Mr. Park.
This was the final straw for Ki-taek, as he stabs Mr. Park in the chest.
The film wraps up efficiently, weeks later. We return on Ki-woo's recovery from brain surgery after Geun-sae attacked him at the party. Ki-jung is dead. Ki-taek is missing. The Parks have moved on, their home sold to an unaware German family.
"Parasite" is far and away one of the best films I've seen all year. I can't recommend it enough.
The film makes many commentaries on class structure. If you're like me, who flew blindly into "Parasite", you may have pondered the obscure title: The Kims and the Parks exist symbiotically. The Parks refuse to live without lavish house employees, and the Kims are willing to literally deceive their employers to death for money. The Kims are parasites that, without a nutrient-rich host, will die.
Like I mentioned earlier, the cinematography of this film is incredible, specifically when Chung-sook is on the phone with the approaching Parks. 
The Parks ask Chung-sook to make Ram-don, which is a combination of two instant Korean noodles. It is also Da-song's favorite. Mrs. Park also mentions, "If you boil the water now, the timing would be perfect. There's some sirloin in the fridge, add that too." Chung-sook's housekeeper facade complies with her boss' request, but on-screen we see animalistic Chung-sook's horror as she realizes the gravity of the scenario.
As soon as Chung-sook hangs up the phone, she delivers the line, "What the hell is Ram-don?"
Ram-don serves as one of the central metaphors in "Parasite". The Parks take top-of-the-line Korean sirloin, an easily $100+ USD equivalent serving of meat, and pair it with a combination of instant noodles no cheaper than Maruchan Ramen. This dish illustrates the classist divide between the Parks and the Kims in such a visceral way that even after three viewings, it still gives me chills.
The filmic stylings such as these completely encapsulate the viewer. "Parasite" yanks the audience into the action, especially when they would much prefer against it.
"Parasite" received a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, as well as The Academy Awards for: Best Picture, Best International Feature, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. "Parasite" also received the Palme d'Or award, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance Cast in a Motion Picture. 
Do yourself a favor. Watch "Parasite". "Parasite" is a film that greatly benefits from close reading and keen observation. Its rapid pace and unexpected twists make for a very re-watchable piece, and I know I've got plenty of time at-home now to mull over its numerous details.

'Parasite' First Trailer: Bong Joon-ho's Palme d'Or Winner Is a Darkly Funny Modern Fairy Tale

Aug 14, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Beloved South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho[1]'s latest already has plenty to recommend it, from a boundary-busting Palme d'Or win at Cannes[2]to a massive box office showing in the filmmaker's home country[3]and even inclusion on IndieWire's own list of the best films of the decade[4]. Next up: a fall festival run and a prime awards-season stateside release date. So what's all the fuss about? Let the film's first U.S. trailer explain, which unspools a tale of two families unlike anything you've seen before. 
Billed as a 'pitch-black modern fairytale,' the film follows two very different families who find themselves tangled up in a complex (and yes, parasitic) bond that is threatened by encroaching outside forces. While the Kim family has street smarts to spare, they've got little else to recommend them — but don't tell the rich Park family that, who easily let the Kims inside their bubble thanks to the Kims' various 'luxury services.' First, the Kim kids offer their services as a tutor and an art therapist, then the rest of the Kims appear with their own skills that the Parks desire to make their rich lifestyle even more cushy. As the Kims cleverly cull any possible interlopers and begin to install their own clan as the Parks' go-to employees, the queasy bond seems to be working. And then things change. As IndieWire's own David Ehrlich wrote in his Cannes review of the film[5], 'Giddy one moment, unbearably tense the next, and always so entertaining and fine-tuned that you don't even notice when it's changing gears, 'Parasite[6]' takes all of the beats you expect to find in a Bong film and shrinks them down with clockwork precision. With 'Parasite,' Bong finally becomes a genre unto himself. Ditching the sci-fi elements that have defined his recent work in favor of a more grounded (but no less eccentric) story of life under the pall of late capitalism, Bong's latest offers another compassionate parable about how society can only be as strong as its most vulnerable people.' The film stars Bong's regular collaborator and starSong Kang Ho, along with Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, and Chang Hyae Jin. 'Parasite' will next screen at TIFF in its Special Presentations section, and is expected to roll out at other festivals during the fall season. Neon will release the film in theaters on October 11.

Jan 10, 2020( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  KEY POINTSA limited series based on the movie "Parasite" is in the works at HBOBong Joon-Ho and Adam McKay are attached to the projectThe movie has received more than 150 international awards till now After becoming the most acclaimed movie of 2019, Bong Joon-Ho's South Korean black-comedy 'Parasite' is all set to become a TV series with one of the world's leading cable networkbacking the project.According to the Hollywood Reporter[1], a limited series around the blockbuster hit movie is in the works at HBO with Joon-Ho and 'Vice' helmer Adam McKay in talks to produce the highly-anticipated show. However, the deals have not yet been finalized and no further details have been provided about the plot, too. The movie has been receiving universal acclaim since its premiere at last year's Cannes Film Festival. 
'Parasite' won the Palme d'Or and became the first film since 2013's 'Blue Is The Warmest Color' to win the prestigious trophy with a unanimous vote.The movie chronicles the journey of the poor Kim family that enters the lives of the supremely rich Park family. The relationship between the two families takes a sharp twist when Kim's plans of becoming rich get entangled in an unexpected incident.The satirical comedy also became the first Korean movie to get nominations at the Golden Globes. The acclaimed movie was awarded Best Foreign-Language Film byNew York Film Critics Circle[2](NYFCC) and it was given the Special Award by theAmerican Film Institute[3](AFI).Just recently, the film and Joon-Ho turned out to be the biggest winners at the 2020 National Society of Film Critics (NSFC) Awards[4]. The movie was adjudged Best Picture while Joon-Ho won in the Screenplay category.But the biggest moment in Joon-Ho's life came when he was nominated for two trophies at the 2020 Golden Globes — considered to be one of the most prestigious awards shows after the Oscars. The film, starring Song Kang-Ho, Lee Sun-Kyun, Cho-Yeo Jeong, Choi Woi-Shik, and Park So-Dam in pivotal roles, won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Film at the star-studded ceremony. While receiving the award, the director noted that the time people would try to'overcome' the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, they willbe introduced to so many 'amazing' films.[embedded content]As of late, the movie has won more than 150 international awards and with the Academy Awards and Critics' Choice Awards still to come, the numbers could go up. The movie currently holds a score of 99 percent[5] on the review site Rotten Tomatoes, and it has been nominated for seven Critics' Choice Awards[6], including Best Picture.

Oscars 2020 Review: #8216;Parasite' Won, and Nothing Else Matters

Feb 10, 2020( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  Bong Joon Ho saved the Oscars[1]. His smile[2]. His crazy hair[3]. The way he walks, and, yes, the way he talks[4], but especially the way he directs — all of these (literally) winning attributes not only contributed to a history-making 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, but kept it from ranking among the worst telecasts of all time. Thanks to #8216;Parasite's#8217; four wins — especially its dark horse victories for Best Picture and Best Director — the 2020 Oscars show stands as one of the best ever. With any other champion, the post-ceremony conversation would already be focused on what to fix next year — and anyone in charge should start making a to-do list now: Hiring a host is a must. Cutting the length down from a bloated three-and-a-half hours is, too. 
Finding a unifying theme, or even a consistent tone, would be the ethereal pursuit for next year's producers, while they sit in dread of more speeches like this year's unmemorable crop. So much of what was put forth during the 2020 Oscars simply didn't work, and it would've added up to an ugly failure on all fronts — if not for our Lord and Savior, Director Bong. The #8216;Parasite#8217; wins represented everything the Oscars were otherwise lacking, from their element of surprise to the glass ceilings they shattered, but before we all choose to collectively forget the rest of the ceremony, let's take it one more from the top: By all accounts, the 2020 Oscars looked first looked like a traditional ceremony, opening with a song-and-dance number, a comedic monologue, and a speech from a bonafide movie star. To all the folks wondering why the show's producers didn't just name Janelle Mone host, I have no answers for you. She's young, charismatic, incredibly talented, and they clearly trusted her to kick off the evening right. Plus, she did set the tone of the night — and it isn't her fault that said tone was best described as #8216;emotional whiplash.#8217; It's not that the two opening numbers didn't gel; that part is by design. It's that the audience didn't know what to do with either one, a theme that carried over to the rest of the night (except, of course, for all those #8216;Parasite#8217; wins, which were met with exactly the right responses). Walking out with a sweet, brief tribute of Mr. Rogers, Mone soon pivoted to a rousing rap/spoken-word number featuring dancers dressed as Oscar-nominated movies and not Oscar-nominated movies? While Mone soldiered on, literally forcing the reticent audience into snapping, singing, and dancing — save for Rita Wilson, who was into it, bless her soul — actual soldiers boogied down behind her. All that pizzazz distracted more than it energized, and viewers[5] at home wondered[6] why the Oscars would remind everyone of the movies their voters chose not to honor[7]. But that was nothing compared to the confusion sparked by Eminem's surprise performance of #8216;Lose Yourself#8217; halfway through the show. No, he wasn't nominated; no, 2020 isn't a significant anniversary for the Oscar-winning 2002 song; no, you didn't travel back in time 18 years to watch that telecast — just like the obvious contextual clues in #8216;Little Women,#8217; you could tell Eminem was taking his one shot in the present day because of his beard. The crowd went along with it as best they could (everyone knows the song), but a surprise performance from a white rapper felt like the strangest addition to an already white ceremony that had used its opening number to emphasize people of color. (After his performance, Eminem tweeted a still-opaque explanation[8].) Much of the evening was equally confounding, in that just about every rewarding high was met by a baffling shrug, if not outright ridicule — much like Steve Martin and Chris Rock's shared monologue! Rock going after Jeff Bezos was great, but undercut by an eye-rolling Iowa caucus joke;Martin repeatedly pointing out that he and Rock are not hosting the show is a much-needed acknowledgement since they did host before, but the duo whiffed while trying to acknowledge the lack of women directors. (#8216;I thought there was something missing from the list this year#8217; #8216;Vaginas?#8217; #8216;Yeah.#8217; OK, guys, but there's also something missing from that joke.) These two are always a welcome presence, and yet the show itself matched their hit-and-miss rapport. including the speeches. Brad Pitt couldn't top himself after a season of incredible thank yous[9] and Quentin Tarantino digs; Laura Dern was sweet in thanking her parents Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, but offered little we hadn't heard in past ceremonies; even Taika Waititi's typically reliable hilarity was undermined by his apparent surprise. (You were one of two favorites! Come prepared!) Hildur Gunadóttir became the first female composer to win in 22 years — adding to an impressive six-month haul[10] that now includes an Oscar, an Emmy, and a Grammy (both for #8216;Chernobyl#8217;) — and her genuine emotion helped temporarily arrest the audience. But then her #8216;Joker#8217; cohort Joaquin Phoenix took the stage for one of two exhausting final speeches that tried to touch on far too many topics. Rather than making a convincing point about one thing, the expected Best Actor winner chose to talk about everything — taking a stand against gender and racial discrimination, environmental disconnect, and the evil corporations behind milk! Phoenix should've taken his own advice to the audience and stopped when he was ahead, and he teed up Renee Zellweger for a rough stint, when the #8216;Judy#8217; star couldn't wrap her long ode to Judy Garland into one affecting sentiment. Add those speeches to redundant, elongating choices by producers — like having presenters for the presenters (because there was no host to introduce the actors announcing the winners) and then asking them to read each nominee's name even though the video montage could've done that in half the time — and, any other year, this would've been a catastrophic ceremony. But it wasn't. It was one of the best telecasts ever. #8216;Parasite#8217; and Director Bong made sure of it. First, the #8216;Okja#8217; and #8216;Memories of Murder#8217; helmer became an instant gif icon with his giddy, wordless reaction to winning Best Original Screenplay. Then, during his speech for Best International Feature, he asked the audience to appreciate his #8216;Parasite#8217; cast (after they were snubbed for individual honors) before sending everyone scrambling for a ticket to the Neon afterparty by exclaiming, #8216;I'm ready to drink tonight!#8217; He doubled down on the sentiment with his Best Director win, promising to #8216;drink until next morning#8217; after nearly bringing Martin Scorsese to tears with as earnest a thank you as you'll ever see at the Oscars. At this point, a #8216;Parasite#8217; Best Picture win started to feel like a real possibility, and whenever it feels like there's an upset in the offing, the Oscars come alive. Plenty of prognosticators predicted the Neon release[11] would triumph, but the odds-on favorite remained #8216;1917#8217; up until Jane Fonda announced (after a very dramatic pause) the first foreign-language drama to ever win the Academy Awards' top prize. (Her announcement is the inverse of #8216;Moonlight's#8217; victory; then, confusion killed any immediate satisfaction, while Fonda's composure elevated this moment.) This came after #8216;Parasite#8217; became the first South Korean film to ever win Best International Feature, which came after #8216;Parasite#8217; became the category's first South Korean nominee. All these firsts are incredibly significant, and yet Bong has preached the ubiquity of film throughout his unprecedented awards run. He's rightly paid tribute to his home country and the devout audiences who've always supported him, while emphasizing the impact his competitors have had on his work and pushing for audiences to embrace film as a universal, unifying medium. The whipsmart writer-director disregarded the uniquely American aspects of artistic competition at every turn, choosing instead to make an eternal awards run[12] feel like what it always claims to be: a celebration of film. In other words, he's lived the words spoken by so many of the winners — #8216;commonality,#8217; #8216;inclusivity,#8217; #8216;doing the right thing#8217; — and the world got to watch the film community respond to that message Sunday night with thunderous applause and gold statues. The Oscars put their money where their mouth is, walking the walk instead of just talking the talk, and each time #8216;Parasite#8217; won, it was a sight to behold. At the Golden Globes, when #8216;Parasite#8217; won the trophy for Best Foreign-Language Film, Director Bong delivered a quote that resonated throughout this awards season. #8216;Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.#8217; Clearly, the Academy heard his message, and now, they've given the rest of America a reason to hurdle their own barriers, as well. For that, we'll forget everything else. #8216;Parasite#8217; won four Academy Awards. Nothing else matters.Grade: AThe 92nd Academy Awards took place Sunday, February 9, 2020 at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, CA and aired on ABC[13].

Jul 02, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  South Korean entertainment powerhouse CJ Entertainment[1] is amping up its international filmmaking efforts on a quest for global prominence. The company is hoping to accomplish this mighty aim, at least in part, with a slate of remakes of South Korean box office hits for major overseas markets, most notably the U.S. Already announced are a pair of collaborations with superstar Kevin Hart: the comedy 'Extreme Job' and the dramedy 'Bye, Bye, Bye.' And while details aren't yet firm, the company is also considering an American remake of Bong Joon-ho[2]'s critically acclaimed Palme d'Or winner 'Parasite[3].' 'We are in very early talks right now,' said Francis Chung, vice president global business and head of U.S. productions at CJ Entertainment, the film's backers. 
During a wide-ranging interview with IndieWire about the company's international plans, Chung was expectedly mum on specifics regarding a potential American remake of 'Parasite,' including who they are in talks with, and which potential stars and filmmakers they are currently eyeing for the gig. The film marks Bong's comeback to Korean-language film following his 'Okja' (2017) and 'Snowpiercer' (2013). It is also his fourth collaboration with his frequent star Song Kang-ho ('Snowpiercer,' 'The Host,' 'Memories of Murder'). Ahead of any stateside redo of the film, NEON[4] will release the Cannes-winning 'Parasite' on October 11 in Los Angeles and New York, positioning the title as a prime awards season contender in the international film category and beyond. The lauded film will receive a traditional arthouse platform release. The film made history at this year's Cannes Film Festival, becoming the first Korean movie to take the festival's top honor.'Parasite' also topped IndieWire's Cannes critics poll[5], winning honors for both best film and best screenplay.In his review, senior film critic David Ehrlich called the dark comedy-drama[6] 'giddy, brilliant, and totally unclassifiable' and one of Bong's best directorial efforts to date. 'Parasite' opened in South Korea on May 30, with a massive home country debut of $25 million. IndieWire box office guru Tom Brueggemann noted that[7] the figure represented about 70% of total box office that weekend: 'To put that in perspective based on population size compared to the US/Canada domestic total, that would be similar to a nearly $200 million debut here. The initial number looks to have come close to the record for biggest opener ever.'

Jan 03, 2020( Den of Geek: http://www.denofgeek.com Delivered by Newstex)  Bong Joon-ho's celebrated Palme d'Or winner finally hits UK cinemas in early 2020 - here's our review  twitter            https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/go/69269...t=Parasite%20review%3A%20a%20riotously%20entertaining%20arthouse%20awards%20contender...=denofgeek j[1]  Unless you've been living in a secret subterranean bunker you'll have heard of Parasite. Bong Joon-ho's hilarious and horrifying Palme d'Or winner has dazzled audiences in the director's native South Korea and across the world, slaying the global box office as few foreign-language films do. 
See related Parasite trailer: the Korean genre movie that might just win an Oscar[2] Oscars 2020 predictions and front runners[3] Bong's class-war banger created a perfect storm of box office success and critical acclaim in late 2019 and the tumult shows little sign of abating in 2020. A February UK theatrical release and home entertainment offerings elsewhere will doubtless put the feature in front of many more eager viewers. Kim Ki-taek (key Bong collaborator Song Kang-ho) and his hard-up nuclear family live in a poky Seoul basement flat when his son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) hears of a golden opportunity for a stellar grift. Ki-woo's pal Min-hyuk has been tutoring Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), the daughter of the affluent Park family, but has to give up the gig to study abroad. The two concoct a plan for Ki-woo to take over the tutoring job - despite Ki-woo being woefully under-qualified - and soon he's ensconced in the Park household and plotting ways to set up the rest of his family with sweet jobs. Using the kind of diligence, planning and cunning thatBlackadder's Baldrick could only dream of, Ki-woo's sister Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) is set up as an art teacher for young Park Da-song, Ki-taek usurps the Park's driver and housekeeper Moon-gwang is maneuvered aside for Kim matriarch Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). In the telling of how all four Kims come to sit pretty in the Park residence without being recognised as a family of con-artist imposters, Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won show more wit and invention than many filmmakers manage for the duration of their running time but in Parasite, this is just the wild hors d'oeuvre ahead of the strangely captivating feast. The remainder of Bong's film is packed with surprises but Moon-gwang (excellent portayed by Lee Jung-eun) is not as easily disregarded as it may seem and neither is the ostensibly ordinary, if beautifully designed, structure of the Park household. Parasite is one of those beautiful rarities in cinema, a clever art-house title with much to say that is riotously entertaining and easily accessible. It tackles aspiration and affluence, desperation and poverty in ways in which all viewers can understand and find recognisable truths in. Neither the Parks nor the Kims are broad-brush villians or heroes and for the most part it's easy to sympathise with both families. Whether one has had the impossibly sad, grindingly tough experience of poverty or been lucky enough to live without financial pressure, it's clear the former is something to escape from and the latter is a life to hold on to, if possible. There are parallels with Shoplifters, Hirokazu Koreeda's 2018 Palme d'or winner - that's now two consecutive wins at Cannes for films about con-artist families living in poverty made by top-notch East Asian filmmakers. Bong has tackled class division before, with sci-fi train romp Snowpiercer (2013) offering an intriguing but less subtle take on the friction between rich and poor. He's also gone more directly for the horror jugular with The Host (2006) and less successfully weirder with GM super-pig oddity Okja (2017). Yet Parasite is Bong's best work to date, a fine summation of his ideas and talent. It shares much with Jordan Peele's Us, in that both films loosely exist in the horror space, both look at society's major ills directly and allegorically and both surely are influenced by Wes Craven's The People Under the Stairs (1991). Yet the Peele and Us comparisons are most apt on the issue of cinematic quality - for Parasite is another unmissable 2019 film, created by another director working at the top of his game who we can expect more fine work from in future. Parasite is in UK cinemas from 7 February.

India, Feb. 10 -- The 92nd Academy Awards started off on script but also delivered a few surprises: Brad Pitt won his first acting Oscar for his performance in Once Upon on a Time ... In Hollywood, Laura Dern won the Best Supporting Actress award and Joaquin Phoenix won Best Actor. Bong Joon Ho won the Best Director Oscar and Parasite took best original screenplay, the inaugural best international feature award, and in a major, history-making upset, the Best Picture award..
The class satire Parasite, which many believe has a chance to upset the front-runner 1917 for best picture, pulled off surprise after surprise. It is tied with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Ford v 1917 for three Oscars.

As it did last year, the annual Dolby Theatre ceremony kicked off without a host. Janelle Monae opened the show entering a Mister Rogers set and singing A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.
"I'm so proud to be standing here as a black queer artist telling stories,' said Monae. 'Happy Black History Month."
Two former Oscar hosts, Chris Rock and Steve Martin, dropped in to supply an opening monologue. Martin called it "an incredible demotion." Martin noted that something was missing from this year's directing nominees. "Vaginas!' Rock replied.

Want more Bong Joon Ho? Here’s how to catch up on the work of the Oscar-winning director of ‘Parasite.’

Feb. 12--Though some folks were surprised by Sunday’s Academy Award wins for South Korean director Bong Joon Ho and his movie Parasite, you could see on Oscar night see that fellow nominees Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino were not among them.
Both are movie buffs, familiar with Bong’s impressive career, and clearly knew it was only a matter of time before his work was recognized on an international scale -- in fact, Parasite had already won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019.
Also probably not surprised? Oscar winner Brad Pitt (best supporting actor for Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood), who produced Bong’s last movie Okja, released in 2017.
Filmmakers and hardcore movie fans have been hip to Bong for years.
“Bong’s other films have already received a good deal of recognition and praise from American critics and filmgoers,” said Jae Won Edward Chung, assistant professor of Asian languages and cultures at Rutgers University and a Bong fan. “Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja have A-list stars like Chris Evans and Jake Gyllenhaal, and The Host (2006) got rave reviews when it was released in the States.”
They’re all worth checking out, he said, but for the uninitiated, he also recommends some of the director’s early, lesser known work.
"Most people probably haven’t heard of Barking Dogs Never Bite -- a quirky black comedy about a struggling academic trying to settle a score with a neighbor’s dog that won’t stop yapping,” he said. “It’s probably still my favorite film by Bong Joon Ho. It doesn’t take itself as seriously as his later works, and yet it has these wonderfully observed everyday moments that really haunt you for a long time after it’s over.”
If you want to see Parasite and some of the director’s previous movies, here’s what to expect and how to find them:
Parasite (2019). Two Korean families, one rich and one poor, intertwine in increasingly fraught ways as members of the lower class family take jobs in the wealthy household. Starring Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, and Parks-dam. The movie is still in theaters, including the Ritz Five and Bryn Mawr Film Institute. You can also rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and YouTube.
Okja (2017). A Korean farm girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) lives in the mountains with a giant pig, who is removed and taken to New York, where an agri-business CEO (Tilda Swinton) has has sinister plans for the animal. The corporate agenda is undermined by animal rights activists (Paul Dano, Steven Yeun). Gyllenhaal is the TV celebrity mixed up in the ensuing media frenzy. Streaming on Netflix.
Snowpiercer (2013). Survivors of a climate-engineering disaster hurtle through a frigid future inside a train, where a revolutionary (Chris Evans) tries to disrupt the rigid class hierarchy that exists on board. With Swinton, Ed Harris, and John Hurt. Streaming on Netflix.
Mother (2009). A extremely twisted tale of a mother (Kim Hye-ja) who will do anything for her son, and a son (Won Bin) who will do anything for mom. As we see in the director’s other films, family can be murder. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Vudu, and YouTube.
The Host (2006). Chemicals dumped into a river produce a ravenous creature that preys upon local residents. A street vendor (Song Kang-ho) fights back with the thing abducts his daughter (Ko Ah-sung). A repertory classic that often turns up in midnight screenings and horror festivals. You can rent or buy on Amazon, Apple, FandangoNow, Google Play, Vudu, and YouTube.
Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000). Residents of an apartment complex turn on each other when one man’s irritation at a noisy dog leads to an unpredictable sequence of retaliation and retribution. You can rent or buy on Amazon Apple, FandangoNow, and Vudu.

"Parasite" film starts discussion on foreign film importance

The Daily Targum
Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite" has been making a name for itself across media, drawing in exceptional reviews for its visuals, storytelling and themes. Many around the globe are calling it one of the best (if not the best) films of 2019 - the numerous awards handed out in ceremonies throughout the world further emphasize the global recognition it has garnered.
Although "Parasite" is the Korean filmmaker's most recognized work in an international point of view, it is by no means Bong's first hit. Other notable works, such as the crime drama "Memories of Murder," monster film "The Host" and sci-fi adventure "Okja" has made him recognized as one of the greatest Korean filmmakers from both the domestic and the international audience.
In general, foreign language films rarely achieve significant attention in the U.S. compared to their domestic competition, but now and then there are examples that surpass the language barrier to find its way to the U.S. mainstream audience. "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and "Life is Beautiful," two of the highest-grossing foreign language films in the U.S. according to IMDb, are examples of this.
Part of "Parasite's" international commercial success can be attributed to Bong's consistency of creating one successful work after another, which has raised higher and higher expectations for his upcoming works.
Yet, unlike the buzz surrounding Bong's latest feature, his older films have been contained to a niche, in addition to the Korean viewership. But this niche seems to have gained more presence as "Parasite" keeps increasing its influence abroad. Another important factor that has affected the movie's popularity is the incredibly positive social media response and word-of-mouth recommendations.
It is difficult to say for sure that "Parasite" will make people more responsive to films from abroad like this in the future, but Bong will certainly gain a bigger following after this international hit.
There are numerous aspects of Bong's "Parasite" that make it appealing. Bong's movies usually involve a plot which unveils a particular aspect about society that runs rampant, out-of-control and invisible - with a good serving of dark humor, of course.
Perhaps these social issues aren't constantly noticed in the quiet passing of our lives, but stories often serve the purpose of putting the uncomfortable truths into the spotlight. Bong displays it quite shamelessly on wide-screen with great emotional impact and eye-catching entertainment.
In "Parasite," Bong focuses on the socioeconomic issues prevalent in South Korea. Much of the conflict is stirred by the impacts of income gap, represented by two families of the opposite economic status. Something that is also referred to in the movie - and is also prevalent in many circumstances of students - is the relationship between prestige, money and education.
The story is based on modern South Korea, so there may be details about the characters and setting that are harder to catch or understand without cultural context. Despite the cultural differences, the struggle for prosperity as well as status in a capitalist system is something that any audience can resonate with. And when the gap between the lower and upper classes becomes more apparent, it can also feel hopeless to outdo that system in order to rise a little higher.
"'Okja,' 'Snowpiercer,' 'Parasite,' they're all stories about capitalism. Before it's a massive, sociological term, capitalism is just our lives." Bong said, according to an interview by Vulture.
After winning the Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 5, in his speech Bong expressed his wish for people to be able to watch films of any language: "Once you overcome the one inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."
Films from other countries may be of a different language, but they can also serve as a bridge between countries so people can overcome differences and find more similarities in societies miles away.

Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or Winner 'Parasite' Gets Sinister First Trailer (Video)

Aug 14, 2019( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Bong Joon-Ho's latest film, 'Parasite,' is a vicious satire of class and wealth with a bloody twist. The first trailer for the Korean auteur's movie showcases the best aspects of his sense of humor and his knack for sinister drama and tension. 
'Parasite' is Bong's return to his native language after making the English-language films 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja.' 'Parasite' also won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival before Neon scooped it up, with plans to release the film on Oct. 11. 'Parasite' is the story of a poor, unemployed family in South Korea who defrauds a wealthy, eccentric and gullible family by posing as various experts and servants and swindling their way into cushy jobs. The son of the poor family takes a job as a tutor of the wealthy family's teenage daughter despite having no college degree. He then convinces his sister to pretend she's a world-class art tutor, despite no formal training of any kind. Also Read: 'Parasite' Film Review: Bong Joon-ho Tackles Disparity With Delicious Dark Comedy[1] 'Dad, I don't think of it as forgery or a crime,' the son says to his unemployed father. 'It's a very opportune gift. Rich people are really gullible,' his father responds. Of course, that's only the setup. And the fun really begins once the family is in deep with their con. It's a twist best left unspoiled, and it's further one that's helping it earn some of the best reviews of the year thus far. Watch the first trailer[2] for 'Parasite' above.

Movie Review: Five-time Oscar-winning movie Parasite

The Oscars recently made history when "Parasite" (2019) became the first non-English and the first South Korean film to win Best Picture. It is also the first movie to win both Best Picture and best international feature.
With the recent "Oscars So White" campaign, this is a huge deal in the movie industry. This motion picture has brought attention to foreign films, especially non-English ones. All of this is incredibly deserved because the film was absolutely wonderful. "Parasite," (2019) directed by Bong Joon-Ho, is a Korean language picture that comments on social classes.
It does so through two different families: the rich, upper-class Park family and the poor, lower-class Kim family.
The film is full of surprises, and despite what many might assume, it is not a horror movie. It is a dramatic thriller with only one moment that really stands out as spooky.
However, there is a lot of violence and blood, so viewer discretion is advised.
Bong Joon-Ho's use of color and space in this film is reminiscent of other East Asian films. While the scenes are very colorful, they are not colors that would usually be very pleasing to the eye. However, the shots are stunning.
One might compare the set-up of various shots to those of Alfred Hitchcock, who used space in unique ways. While the color is obviously different from Hitchcock's black and white films, the repetition of stairways and views from windows might make one compare this movie to those of Hitchcock.
The script for this film is also quite interesting. There is never a dull moment, and the dialogue certainly added to this. The Kim family is full of people desperate for money, and they have a dry sense of humor about them. This often helps to ease the tension of the plot, which isn't always an easy task.
The tension is done very well, leaving the audience on the edge of their seat for half, if not most, of the film. Some scenes in particular are incredibly tense and will leave the viewer questioning who exactly they are rooting for. There are moments when one character's life is on the line, but not because of who the audience might have originally thought.
Not only is this film about social class, but it is also about morals. It makes an interesting commentary on both subjects, leaving the viewer thinking about this movie for days after seeing it. While the audience starts out rooting for one character, that opinion may switch halfway through.
This is something Bong Joon-Ho did incredibly well; he made the characters relatably human. All of them are sympethetically flawed people with questionable morals. "Parasite" (2019) is a stunningly crafted film worthy of every Oscar it won. It will leave the audience questioning their way of thinking for days to come, and hopefully, open a few minds at the same time.
With President Trump saying he didn't understand this movie, it makes me quite pleased to say just how much I love it. Final score: 10/10.

‘Parasite’ Review: The Lower Depths Rise With a Vengeance; Critic’s Pick

Body




In Bong Joon Ho’s new film, a destitute family occupies a wealthy household in an elaborate scheme that goes comically — then horribly — wrong. 
Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling “Parasite,” a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none. “They’re rich but still nice,” he says, aglow with good will. His wife has her doubts. “They’re nice because they’re rich,” she counters. With their two adult children, they have insinuated themselves into the lives of their pampered counterparts. It’s all going so very well until their worlds spectacularly collide, erupting with annihilating force. Comedy turns to tragedy and smiles twist into grimaces as the real world splatters across the manicured lawn.
The story takes place in South Korea but could easily unfold in Los Angeles or London. The director Bong Joon Ho (“Okja”) creates specific spaces and faces — outer seamlessly meets inner here — that are in service to universal ideas about human dignity, class, life itself. With its open plan and geometric shapes, the modernist home that becomes the movie’s stage (and its house of horrors) looks as familiar as the cover of a shelter magazine. It’s the kind of clean, bright space that once expressed faith and optimism about the world but now whispers big-ticket taste and privilege.
“Space and light and order,” Le Corbusier said, are as necessary as “bread or a place to sleep.” That’s a good way of telegraphing the larger catastrophe represented by the cramped, gloomy and altogether disordered basement apartment where Kim Ki-taek (the great Song Kang Ho) benignly reigns. A sedentary lump (he looks as if he’s taken root), Ki-taek doesn’t have a lot obviously going for him. But he has a home and the affection of his wife and children, and together they squeeze out a meager living assembling pizza boxes for a delivery company. They’re lousy at it, but that scarcely matters as much as the petty humiliations that come with even the humblest job.
The Kims’ fortunes change after the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik), lands a lucrative job as an English-language tutor for the teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso), of the wealthy Park family. The moment that he walks up the quiet, eerily depopulated street looking for the Park house it’s obvious we’re not idling in the lower depths anymore. Ki-woo crosses the threshold into another world, one of cultivated sensitivities and warmly polished surfaces that are at once signifiers of bourgeois success and blunt reproaches to his own family’s deprivation. For him, the house looks like a dream, one that his younger sister and parents soon join by taking other jobs in the Park home.
Take being the operative word. The other Kims don’t secure their positions as art tutor, housekeeper and chauffeur, they seize them, using lies and charm to get rid of the Parks’ other employees — including a longtime housekeeper (a terrifically vivid Lee Jung Eun) — in a guerrilla incursion executed with fawning smiles. The Parks make it easy (no background checks). Yet they’re not gullible, as Ki-taek believes, but are instead defined by cultivated helplessness, the near-infantilization that money affords. In outsourcing their lives, all the cooking and cleaning and caring for their children, the Parks are as parasitical as their humorously opportunistic interlopers.
Bong’s command of the medium is thrilling. He likes to move the camera, sometimes just to nudge your attention from where you think it should be, but always in concert with his restlessly inventive staging. When, in an early scene, the Kims crowd their superior from the pizza company, their bodies nearly spilling out of the frame, the image both underscores the family’s closeness and foreshadows their collective assault on the Parks. Nothing if not a rigorous dialectician, Bong refuses to sentimentalize the Kims’ togetherness or their poverty. But he does pointedly set it against the relative isolation of the Parks, who don’t often share the same shot much less the same room.
[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]
Bong has some ideas in “Parasite,” but the movie’s greatness isn’t a matter of his apparent ethics or ethos — he’s on the side of decency — but of how he delivers truths, often perversely and without an iota of self-serving cant. (He likes to get under your skin, not wag his finger.) He accents the rude comedy of the Kims’ struggle with slyness and precision timing, encouraging your laughter. When the son and daughter can’t locate a Wi-Fi signal — the family has been tapping a neighbor’s — they find one near the toilet (an apt tribute to the internet). And when a cloud of fumigation billows in from outside, an excited Ki-taek insists on keeping the windows open to take advantage of the free insecticide. They choke, you laugh. You also squirm.
The lightly comic tone continues after the Kims begin working for the Parks, despite ripples of unease that develop into riptides. Some of this disquiet is expressed in the dialogue, including through the Kims’ performative subservience, with its studied courtesies and strategic hedging. (Bong shares script credit with Han Jin Won.) The poor family quickly learns what the rich family wants to hear. For their part, Mr. and Mrs. Park (Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong) speak the language of brutal respectability each time they ask for something (a meal, say) or deploy a metaphor, as when he gripes about people who “cross the line” and smell like “old radishes.”
The turning point comes midway through when the Parks leave on a camping trip, packing up their Range Rover, outdoor projector included. In their absence, the Kims bring out the booze, kick back and take over the house, a break that’s cut short when the old housekeeper returns, bringing a surprise with her. The slapstick becomes more violent, the stakes more naked, the laughs more terrifying and cruel. By that point, you are as comfortably settled in as the Kims; the house is so very pleasant, after all. But the cost of that comfort and those pretty rooms — and the eager acquiescence to the unfairness and meanness they signify — comes at a terrible price.

'Parasite': Read the script of the best movie of the year

 The South Korean film Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho, won four major awards at the 2020 Academy Awards Sunday night in Los Angeles. It earned both the best picture and best international feature film awards, an unprecedented event, and Bong won the prizes for best director and best original screenplay.
Sam Mendes' 1917 earned three awards (including veteran Roger Deakins for best cinematography), while Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood, James Mangold's Ford v Ferrari and Todd Phillips' Joker each won two. Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) and Renee Zellweger (Rupert Goold's Judy) collected the best actor and best actress awards, with Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood) and Laura Dern (Noah Baumbach's Marriage Story) winning in the best supporting actor and actress categories.
Parasite deserved to win the most serious awards. It was markedly superior to every other film up for consideration. Bong's effort is a complex, troubling work about the social, economic and psychological disaster represented by the vast gap between rich and poor. Two families, the Kims and the Parks, who ordinarily live at the opposite ends of society, are suddenly brought into close proximity, with terrible consequences. The climactic scene culminates in an eruption of class anger.
As we noted in our original review, South Korea is one of the most socially unequal societies on the planet. Bong's film spells out, in a thoughtful and logical manner, the inevitable results of such a division: the impoverished will do almost anything to emerge from their nightmarish conditions, subsisting literally in the underworld. The pampered rich, living in a cocoon, are utterly unprepared for the envy, anger and violence their dominance and arrogance provokes.
Bong told the Guardian recently that 'Korea, on the surface, seems like a very rich and glamorous country now, with K-pop, high-speed internet and IT technology … but the relative wealth between rich and poor is widening. The younger generation, in particular, feels a lot of despair.'
The director, in the film's production notes, pointed to the fact that 'in this sad world humane relationships … cannot hold.' Parasite, he explains, depicts 'ordinary people' who descend into an 'unavoidable' collision. The film is 'a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.'
Bong told an interviewer last year, 'I think all creators, all artists, and even just everyone, we are always interested in class, 24/7, I think it would actually be strange if we're not. … I think we all have very sensitive antennae to class, in general.' Unfortunately, as the vast majority of films nominated for Academy Awards this year indicates, this is not the case. The attention certainly of most American filmmakers is firmly on themselves and their ethnic, gender and sexual identities.
It is not clear that Bong, who describes his background and present circumstances as thoroughly middle class, is particularly left-wing in his thinking. He may merely be more observant and honest than most in the film world. (His lack of clarity found expression Sunday night in his friendly comments-to the extent they were not merely polite or diplomatic-directed toward fellow best director nominees Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino, by whom he claimed to have been inspired. In fact, Parasite is opposed in every significant way to the murky, misanthropic efforts of Scorsese and Tarantino.) Bong has been paying attention in his films to developments in South Korean society for two decades, with such works as Barking Dogs Never Bite (2000), Memories of Murder (2003), Mother (2009), Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017).
The sweeping triumph of a South Korean film about class resentment and conflict at the Academy Awards has a certain objective significance, no matter what the rest of the Awards program may have been like and no matter how the voters may slip back and delude themselves, as they are wont to do, in subsequent years. Despite all the efforts by the media, the Academy hierarchy and the political establishment generally to drown culture in race and gender, the social questions emerge.
And those efforts Sunday night were considerable. The organizers of the Awards ceremony were stung and disappointed by the outcome of the nominating process, which resulted in only one black performer nominated for an acting award (Cynthia Erivo in Harriet) and no female directors. The last weeks have been dominated by the subsequent media 'furor.'
The New York Times, inevitably, played a leading role. The Times, for example, referred in one recent article to 'the Oscars' most noted offscreen controversy-the glaring whiteness and maleness of many of the major categories and movies.' And another piece observed: 'Going into the 92nd Academy Awards, the headlines were about what we wouldn't see: no J. Lo [Jennifer Lopez for Hustlers], no female filmmakers of top films, almost no people of color in the acting categories.' And the relentless Times commented further: 'Old Hollywood-and the way it is represented by the academy and its nominations-has been under the microscope for awhile now, whether because of #OscarsSoWhite or #MeToo or the lack of recognition of female directors.'
In our view, American filmmaking is truly deficient at this point in an objectively rooted social and moral compass, oriented to the problem of social inequality and class, as well as the great threats confronting the population, authoritarian rule and war. The filmmaker who is oblivious to these questions, whatever his or her gender, race or orientation, will have little of value to say to an audience.
After all, the first female director on whom the Academy bestowed-with great fanfare and much self-congratulation-its best director prize, in 2012, was Kathryn Bigelow, for the thoroughly falsified, CIA-sponsored account of the death of Osama bin-Laden, Zero Dark Thirty.
This year, in response to the angry response to the nominations and the resulting pressures, the organizers of the Awards event did everything within their power to inject race and gender politics into their program Sunday night, to an obvious extent. Desperately over-compensating for their failure to nominate the 'proper' number of 'nonwhite' and 'nonmale' personalities, the Academy made certain that there would be no such complaints when it came to the presenters, singers, comics and musicians, and their various comments about female or black 'representation.'
This sort of campaign does not address the legitimate, democratic question of the cultural education and involvement of vast numbers of young people, of all colors and genders, who are excluded from participating in the film, television and music industry because of their social background and economic conditions. What's involved in the Academy's 'diversity' program is the conformist acceptance of the cultural status quo and the mere redistribution of a portion of the existing positions and wealth to African American, female and gay individuals, already affluent in many cases.
This appeals only to a relatively thin layer of the population. No doubt various factors account for the continuing decline of the Academy Awards' television audience, which reached its lowest level in history Sunday night, 23.6 million people, but the self-involved, often self-pitying emphasis on race and gender is not widely and popularly appealing.
For example, this moment, described by ABC News, was simply grating: '[Actresses] Sigourney Weaver, Gal Gadot and Brie Larson joined together on stage to introduce a groundbreaking performance of this year's nominated best original scores.
''We want to celebrate the first time in the 92-[year] history of the Academy Awards-a female conductor will be leading the orchestra for this performance,' Weaver said.
'With Gadot and Larson by her side, Weaver said, 'all women are superheroes.''
The New York Times took the unusual step of running an advertisement for their racialist and discredited 'The 1619 Project' during the Awards ceremony. The spot featured actress-singer Janelle Monáe (who actually opened the program with a musical number), as one publication described it, 'standing alone on the Virginia shore. The water swirls behind her and the camera pulls in closer as she recites the following words: 'In August 1619, a ship appeared on this horizon near Point Comfort, Virginia. It carried more than 20 enslaved Africans who were sold to the colonists. No aspect of the country we know today has been untouched by the slavery that followed. America was not America, but this was the moment it began.''
Cynically, the Times ad concluded with this title: 'The truth can change how we see the world. The truth is worth it."
Democratic Party politics dominate the Hollywood film world. In a reference to the recently concluded impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Brad Pitt, accepting his award for best supporting actor (for Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood), quipped, 'They told me I only had 45 seconds, and that's 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.' Bolton, of course, is the extreme reactionary and warmonger with whom the Democrats formed a de facto alliance after his claims about Trump and Ukraine in an upcoming book were leaked to the media.
The success of Parasite at the Academy Awards was generally praised by the American media. But not everyone was happy. Of course, an avowedly right-wing columnist last week headlined his comment, 'Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite' Is Overrated, Implausible, Class-Struggle Nonsense.'
Aside from such reactionaries, however, a few other nervous voices were raised. Critic Ann Hornaday in the Washington Post , in particular, has made it known that the prominence of Parasite was not pleasing to her. Hornaday's tack was to treat Parasite as though it were simply a variation on the Tarantino-style cinema of gratuitous violence and avoid its social content. 'The techniques and tropes Bong repurposes so adroitly in Parasite ,' she wrote, resorting to feminist jargon, 'make the film feel both original and oddly familiar, the product of the male gaze that still holds sway in Hollywood.'
Speaking of the Awards ceremony, Hornaday asserted that 'clips from the best picture nominees played out like so many boys-with-their-toys wish-fulfillment fantasies, complete with swagger, cars that go vroom and women who are either silenced or virtually absent.' How could Greta Gerwig's Little Women compete 'against so many films that mythologized Big Men?' Lumping in Parasite with the confused and even disoriented Joker, the Post critic described the two films as 'derivative and insular, a self-referential grab bag of 'cool' visual style-often involving bloody violence-in service to narratives that were either flimsy or just plain shallow.'
The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, who was in the Academy Awards audience in Los Angeles the other night. He too might well agree that the unsettling ideas propelling Parasite are 'either flimsy or just plain shallow.'

                     PARASITE was one of the big winners during the Oscars 2020 ceremony.                   
The South Korean film collected four gongs on the night, including Best Picture.
Parasite made history when it was named Best Picture, becoming the first non-English language movie to receive the accolade. 
The black comedy beat British war movie 1917 and took home another three awards that evening.
                                            How many awards did Parasite win at the Oscars 2020?                                        
Parasite was nominated for six Academy Awards, including the coveted Best Picture category.
The film was also put forward for Directing, International Feature Film, Writing (Original screenplay), Film Editing and Production Design.
On awards night, Parasite collected trophies for Directing, Best Picture, International Feature Film and Writing (Original Screenplay).
The incredible wins meant the South Korean comedy took home more than half of the awards it was nominated for.
Collecting the Best Picture gong, Parasite producer Kwak Sin Ae said: "I'm speechless. We never imagined this to ever happen. 
"We are so happy. I feel like a very opportune moment in history is happening right now.
"I express my deepest gratitude and respect for all the members of the Academy for making this decision."
Praising the director, Lee Jeong Un added: "I'd really like to thank director Bong. 
"Thank you for being you and I like everything about him: his smile, his crazy hair, the way he talks, the way he walks, and especially the way he directs."
                                            What are the reviews like for Parasite?                                        
The movie has an abundance of exceptionally good reviews, including one from The Guardian in which critic Mark Kermode gave it five out of five stars.
Of Parasite, Kermode said: "It's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."
Also giving the film a perfect score, Independent critic Clarisse Loughrey wrote: "The director's work is as playful as it is sincere and revelatory. 
"He'll make you feel at home, and then rip the rug out from under you."
The Sun's Jamie East said of the film: "It is completely gripping. Director Bong Joon-ho displays incredible dexterity here."
Showering the director with praise, Empire's John Nugent enthused: "A miracle of a film. It feels like Bong Joon-ho's already extraordinary career has been building to this: a riotous social satire that's as gloriously entertaining as it is deeply sardonic."
                                            What is Parasite about?                                        
Dubbed a psychological thriller, with dark comedy, Parasite is centred around the Kim family, who are unemployed and living in a grubby basement.
Focusing on the families' interactions with a much more wealthier brood, the Parks; one of the Kim children is eventually employed by the family, as a tutor.
Seeing this, the rest of the Kim family begins to follow him in entering the Parks' home but it has unexpected consequences.
The movie touches on class differences and has a few twists and turn, which will leave viewers second-guessing themselves.
                                            When is the UK release date for Parasite?                                        
The film hit UK theatres on Friday, February 7, 2020 - just two days before it won big at the 92nd Academy Awards.
Parasite can be found in most cinemas including the big three - Oden, Cineworld and Picurehouse - among others.

'Parasite' Review: The Lower Depths Rise With a Vengeance; Critic's Pick

In Bong Joon Ho's new film, a destitute family occupies a wealthy household in an elaborate scheme that goes comically - then horribly - wrong. 
Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling "Parasite," a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none. "They're rich but still nice," he says, aglow with good will. His wife has her doubts. "They're nice because they're rich," she counters. With their two adult children, they have insinuated themselves into the lives of their pampered counterparts. It's all going so very well until their worlds spectacularly collide, erupting with annihilating force. Comedy turns to tragedy and smiles twist into grimaces as the real world splatters across the manicured lawn.
The story takes place in South Korea but could easily unfold in Los Angeles or London. The director Bong Joon Ho ("Okja") creates specific spaces and faces - outer seamlessly meets inner here - that are in service to universal ideas about human dignity, class, life itself. With its open plan and geometric shapes, the modernist home that becomes the movie's stage (and its house of horrors) looks as familiar as the cover of a shelter magazine. It's the kind of clean, bright space that once expressed faith and optimism about the world but now whispers big-ticket taste and privilege.
"Space and light and order," Le Corbusier said, are as necessary as "bread or a place to sleep." That's a good way of telegraphing the larger catastrophe represented by the cramped, gloomy and altogether disordered basement apartment where Kim Ki-taek (the great Song Kang Ho) benignly reigns. A sedentary lump (he looks as if he's taken root), Ki-taek doesn't have a lot obviously going for him. But he has a home and the affection of his wife and children, and together they squeeze out a meager living assembling pizza boxes for a delivery company. They're lousy at it, but that scarcely matters as much as the petty humiliations that come with even the humblest job.
The Kims' fortunes change after the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik), lands a lucrative job as an English-language tutor for the teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso), of the wealthy Park family. The moment that he walks up the quiet, eerily depopulated street looking for the Park house it's obvious we're not idling in the lower depths anymore. Ki-woo crosses the threshold into another world, one of cultivated sensitivities and warmly polished surfaces that are at once signifiers of bourgeois success and blunt reproaches to his own family's deprivation. For him, the house looks like a dream, one that his younger sister and parents soon join by taking other jobs in the Park home.
Take being the operative word. The other Kims don't secure their positions as art tutor, housekeeper and chauffeur, they seize them, using lies and charm to get rid of the Parks' other employees - including a longtime housekeeper (a terrifically vivid Lee Jung Eun) - in a guerrilla incursion executed with fawning smiles. The Parks make it easy (no background checks). Yet they're not gullible, as Ki-taek believes, but are instead defined by cultivated helplessness, the near-infantilization that money affords. In outsourcing their lives, all the cooking and cleaning and caring for their children, the Parks are as parasitical as their humorously opportunistic interlopers.
Bong's command of the medium is thrilling. He likes to move the camera, sometimes just to nudge your attention from where you think it should be, but always in concert with his restlessly inventive staging. When, in an early scene, the Kims crowd their superior from the pizza company, their bodies nearly spilling out of the frame, the image both underscores the family's closeness and foreshadows their collective assault on the Parks. Nothing if not a rigorous dialectician, Bong refuses to sentimentalize the Kims' togetherness or their poverty. But he does pointedly set it against the relative isolation of the Parks, who don't often share the same shot much less the same room.
[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]
Bong has some ideas in "Parasite," but the movie's greatness isn't a matter of his apparent ethics or ethos - he's on the side of decency - but of how he delivers truths, often perversely and without an iota of self-serving cant. (He likes to get under your skin, not wag his finger.) He accents the rude comedy of the Kims' struggle with slyness and precision timing, encouraging your laughter. When the son and daughter can't locate a Wi-Fi signal - the family has been tapping a neighbor's - they find one near the toilet (an apt tribute to the internet). And when a cloud of fumigation billows in from outside, an excited Ki-taek insists on keeping the windows open to take advantage of the free insecticide. They choke, you laugh. You also squirm.
The lightly comic tone continues after the Kims begin working for the Parks, despite ripples of unease that develop into riptides. Some of this disquiet is expressed in the dialogue, including through the Kims' performative subservience, with its studied courtesies and strategic hedging. (Bong shares script credit with Han Jin Won.) The poor family quickly learns what the rich family wants to hear. For their part, Mr. and Mrs. Park (Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong) speak the language of brutal respectability each time they ask for something (a meal, say) or deploy a metaphor, as when he gripes about people who "cross the line" and smell like "old radishes."
The turning point comes midway through when the Parks leave on a camping trip, packing up their Range Rover, outdoor projector included. In their absence, the Kims bring out the booze, kick back and take over the house, a break that's cut short when the old housekeeper returns, bringing a surprise with her. The slapstick becomes more violent, the stakes more naked, the laughs more terrifying and cruel. By that point, you are as comfortably settled in as the Kims; the house is so very pleasant, after all. But the cost of that comfort and those pretty rooms - and the eager acquiescence to the unfairness and meanness they signify - comes at a terrible price.

Nov 03, 2019( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  NEON's 'Parasite' set a new personal box office record for Bong Joon-ho this weekend, as the Korean filmmaker now has his first $100 million-plus global grosser. Expanding to 461 screens in North America, 'Parasite' continued its strong run at the indie box office this weekend, grossing $2.6 million and bringing its domestic total to $7.5 million. Its global total grew to $108 million, making it the first film from Joon-ho to gross over $100 million worldwide, passing his career high $89 million earned by his 2006 monster film 'The Host.'

A24's 'The Lighthouse' added $1.94 million from 978 screens to bring its total to $6.9 million after three weekends. Elsewhere, 101 Studios' 'The Current War' added $1.2 million from 1,082 screens to bring its total to just under $5 million after 10 days in theaters. Roadside Attractions' 'Judy' added $582,000 in its sixth weekend for a total of just under $23 million, while Sony Pictures Classics' 'Pain and Glory' added $348,000 from 111 screens for a total of $2.1 million.

As with all Netflix theatrical releases, box office numbers are not being reported, but the film will expand to independent cinemas in top 10 markets next weekend. In timing with the release, The New York Times[3] posted a report on the failed negotiations between Netflix and theater chains to give 'The Irishman' wide distribution. 'This is a major director, a cinephile, who has made all kinds of important movies for our industry,' Fithian said. 'And 'The Irishman'is going to play on one-tenth of the screens it should have played on, had Netflix been willing to come to an understanding with our members.'

Review: Bong Joon-ho's Parasite

Parasite is a veritable hit. Having recently crossed $100 million at the international box office, the film now qualifies as director Bong Joon Ho's highest grossing film to date, surpassing his Chris Evans-helmed dystopia Snowpiercer from 2013. Opening in three theaters this October, the film landed the highest per-theater-average ever for a foreign language film (and 18th highest per-theater-average of all time) with a $393,216 opening weekend. Parasite has been one of the most-talked-about movies of the year since its premiere this summer at the Cannes Film Festival, where it became a surprise winner of the Palme d'Or, the prestigious festival's top prize.
The film is basking in near-universal critical acclaim, and currently boasts a rare 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. This review may run the risk of simply adding yet another voice of praise into the noise, but if there's any film that deserves this level of celebration, it's Parasite, one of the most rewarding, meticulous watches of the year.
The film sees Bong take a step away from high-concept English-language fare like Snowpiercer and his 2017 Netflix film Okja and away from spectacular creature-features like The Host; Parasite skirts his usual science fiction themes to instead examine the monsters lurking within ourselves and our own homes.
Bong has an uncanny talent for manipulating tone; each scene feels like a master class in atmospheric tension. He strikes a careful balance between crafting a genuine character piece and a home invasion thriller, taking a complicated meditation on toxic class relations and dressing it up as a smart, entertaining genre piece.
It's the kind of film you need to see in a dark theater on a big screen, if only to allow yourself to sink into its story as completely as possible. The cast is a true ensemble, with quality performances across the board that each carry the film in their own way. Leading that group is Kang-ho Song, renowned South Korean actor and frequent collaborator of Bong's, whose final scene-stealing moments are as affecting as they are impressive.
The production design of Parasite is virtually unparalleled, with a level of detail and care that pays off in every scene. The centerpiece of this achievement is as an entire mansion set, which Bong and his production designer conceptualized and built from the ground up. Every corner and light fixture is particularly placed to serve the story, and, as cliche as the sentiment may seem, the house itself becomes a character in the film.
Parasite is unusually difficult to discuss. It is best experienced without spoilers, but many of its discussion-worthy aspects of it are spoilers themselves. Do not let that be a deterrent, however, because it is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels. It is a genuinely fun watch, a rewarding commentary on class structures, and a study in the craft of storytelling through filmmaking. Parasite is an earnest and carefully crafted piece of art from a masterful director - the type of achievement that comes around only so often.

It's best to go into "Parasite," the latest film from acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, with no expectations. The Palme d'Or winner at the most recent Cannes film festival has garnered much attention since its U.S. release last month-and for good reason.
"Parasite" follows the Kims, a family of four who live in a cramped, underground apartment fit for maybe two. With neither child attending university and both parents unemployed, the entire family is beginning to lose hope, to say the least. That is until a childhood friend of oldest child Ki-woo's shows up bearing gifts, both physically in the form of a large rock (which essentially could've had "SYMBOL" painted across it) and through an offer: to take over for him as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks.
Though their make-up is the same (Mother, Father, Son, Daughter), the Parks exist in direct juxtaposition of the Kims. The patriarch is the CEO of a large IT company, while Yeon-gyo, his wife, is a textbook rich stay-at-home mom. When Yeon-gyo takes liking to Ki-woo-who lied about his education in order to get the job-he quickly hatches a plan to get his entire family involved.
It's wildly entertaining to watch as the Kims, much like the titular parasites, plant themselves in the Park estate-daughter Ki-jeong as an art therapist, father Ki-taek as a driver and mother Chung-sook as the housekeeper. A good chunk of the film's comedic aspects come from these scenes, like when Ki-taek strategically uses a packet of hot sauce to convince Yeon-gyo that their previous housekeeper has come down with tuberculosis.
The Kims only reap the benefits of their work for a brief period of time, however, as the film undergoes a massive shift in tone around its midpoint. While it plays like a comedy for its first half, a doorbell-ring after a particularly lighthearted scene catapults the film into the madness of its second act, the contents of which I will not be disclosing here because-and this is cliché-you just have to see it.
Under the direction of Bong, whose previous works include "Snowpiercer" and "Okja," "Parasite" is a giant, larger-than-life story told with the delicacy of an indie movie and the tension of a big-studio horror. From the start, Bong and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo thrust you into the Kims' world, filming their apartment in such a way that you find yourself feeling suffocated while seated in a multiplex.
It's also a testament to Bong's masterful direction that the film is able to feel like so many different things at once. "Parasite" is genre-bending at its finest, weaving between comedy, drama and horror with such ease that your emotions struggle to even keep up.
The screenplay, penned by Bong and Han Jin-won, is razor sharp, fluctuating between smart takes on class relations to the iconic "Jessica, only child, from Illinois, Chicago" rhyme which, and I've checked with the Academy, is in fact a front runner for the Best Original Song Oscar.
The twists that act as transitions come sporadically and are genuinely shocking. Just when Bong gets you comfortable with the film in one way, things switch gears. It's uncomfortable, but in the best way.
"Parasite" owes a lot to its ensemble, a solid cast of actors who perfectly capture the intricacies of each character, from the neurotic nature of Ki-woo to the stoic composure of Park Dong-ik, the father of the Park family. Standouts are easily Park So-dam, who nails the more nuanced role of Ki-jeong, and Cho Yeo-jeong in a hilarious turn as Choi Yeon-gyo. If the world is right, either of these women should land a Supporting Actress nomination a la Marina de Tavira for "Roma," last year's breakthrough foreign language feature.
Another aspect of "Parasite" that ties the film together is the set design. The Park house is stunning, a modern mansion that feels never-ending, with its giant windows and lengthy staircases. The village where the Kims reside is less inviting, but still a technically outstanding set that manages to truly look like an actual South Korean street.
Aside from its visuals, "Parasite" is also a wildly important film that acts as fresh, witty and horrifying commentary on South Korean class relations. Bong does this through obvious actions and words, like the relationship the Parks have with their help, but also through a plethora of powerful symbols, most of which cannot be described without spoiling. The most striking case of this is a particularly moving scene as the Kim family quite literally descends to their residence from the Parks', running through the rain in search of the comfort of their home, only to arrive home to it completely destroyed by a flood.
All things considered, "Parasite" is easily one of the best, if not the best film of the year. Bong handles every aspect with expertise, and its ability to be so much at once while remaining so focused makes it a thrill to watch.

Review: Bong Joon-ho's Parasite

Parasite is a veritable hit. Having recently crossed $100 million at the international box office, the film now qualifies as director Bong Joon Ho's highest grossing film to date, surpassing his Chris Evans-helmed dystopia Snowpiercer from 2013. Opening in three theaters this October, the film landed the highest per-theater-average ever for a foreign language film (and 18th highest per-theater-average of all time) with a $393,216 opening weekend. Parasite has been one of the most-talked-about movies of the year since its premiere this summer at the Cannes Film Festival, where it became a surprise winner of the Palme d'Or, the prestigious festival's top prize.
The film is basking in near-universal critical acclaim, and currently boasts a rare 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. This review may run the risk of simply adding yet another voice of praise into the noise, but if there's any film that deserves this level of celebration, it's Parasite, one of the most rewarding, meticulous watches of the year.
The film sees Bong take a step away from high-concept English-language fare like Snowpiercer and his 2017 Netflix film Okja and away from spectacular creature-features like The Host; Parasite skirts his usual science fiction themes to instead examine the monsters lurking within ourselves and our own homes.
Bong has an uncanny talent for manipulating tone; each scene feels like a master class in atmospheric tension. He strikes a careful balance between crafting a genuine character piece and a home invasion thriller, taking a complicated meditation on toxic class relations and dressing it up as a smart, entertaining genre piece.
It's the kind of film you need to see in a dark theater on a big screen, if only to allow yourself to sink into its story as completely as possible. The cast is a true ensemble, with quality performances across the board that each carry the film in their own way. Leading that group is Kang-ho Song, renowned South Korean actor and frequent collaborator of Bong's, whose final scene-stealing moments are as affecting as they are impressive.
The production design of Parasite is virtually unparalleled, with a level of detail and care that pays off in every scene. The centerpiece of this achievement is as an entire mansion set, which Bong and his production designer conceptualized and built from the ground up. Every corner and light fixture is particularly placed to serve the story, and, as cliche as the sentiment may seem, the house itself becomes a character in the film.
Parasite is unusually difficult to discuss. It is best experienced without spoilers, but many of its discussion-worthy aspects of it are spoilers themselves. Do not let that be a deterrent, however, because it is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels. It is a genuinely fun watch, a rewarding commentary on class structures, and a study in the craft of storytelling through filmmaking.

Black-comic thriller from South Korean director of Okja and Snowpiercer takes the top honours at the 72nd edition of the festival

Bong Joon-ho has won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for his black comic thriller Parasite.
The South Korean director is best known for previous films Okja and Snowpiercer, and earned rave reviews for his new film, which is about a poor family who insinuate themselves as servants into a much richer one. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw described it as "a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama [that] runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character".
Bong is the first Korean director to have won the top award at Cannes, after last appearing in competition with Okja in 2017. He is the second Asian winner in successive years, after Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda triumphed in 2018 with Shoplifters.
Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood left empty-handed despite widespread critical acclaim, as did another heavyweight director Ken Loach, whose gig-economy drama Sorry We Missed You had made a major impact at the beginning of the festival.
The awards ceremony is always brisk, compared to the Oscars, with little time for political pronouncements from the podium. However Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore, as he presented the jury prize, hit out at Donald Trump, quoting painter Pablo Picasso. "Art is the lie that enables us to realise the truth," he said, "Trump is the lie that enables us more lying." Moore added: "In dark times, art is what has helped save humanity from the autocrats and idiots."
The Grand Prix – considered the runners-up award – went to Senegalese director Mati Diop for Atlantique, a supernatural drama about African migrants. Diop had atttracted considerable attention before the festival as the first black woman to have a film selected for competition, and her film was a resounding critical success.
Antonio Banderas was a popular winner of the best actor award for Pedro Almodovar's Pain and Glory; Banderas played a film-maker clearly modelled on Almodovar himself as he looks back over his career, in which memories of his mother (played by Penelope Cruz) loom large.
Emily Beecham – the British star of cult hit Daphne – won the best actress award for Little Joe, a sci-fi parable directed by Austrian film-maker Jessica Hausner. She is the first British actor to win in this category since 1997, when Kathy Burke triumphed for her performance in the Gary Oldman-directed Nil by Mouth.
Brazilian film Bacurau and French drama Les Misérables shared the third-place jury prize: the former was jointly directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelle and won plaudits for its anti Jair Bolsonaro message, while the latter, from first time feature director Ladj Ly, was much liked for its portrayal of tough French street life.
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the veteran Belgian film-makers who have previously won the Palme d'Or twice, took home the best director award for their radicalisation drama Young Ahmed, while Céline Sciamma, considered by many critics a strong contender for the Palme d'Or, was given best screenplay for her 18th-century-set lesbian romance Portrait of a Lady on Fire.
In a press conference after the awards ceremony, Bong thanked Cannes for the honour, saying: "It is the 100th anniversary of cinema in Korea this year. I think that Cannes has given Korean cinema a great gift." He also added that he was pleased to hear that the jury had unanimously voted for Parasite to win, and "as I am a real fan of films it is another reason to be pleased".
Bong deflected a suggestion that Parasite contained comments aimed at North Korea, saying that an impression of a North Korean TV anchor in the film was "just a small joke". "If North Koreans see my film one day, I think they will laugh."
In a press conference after the awards ceremony, Banderas joked that the win was "good news for his cardiologist" and thanked Almódovar, the director of Pain and Glory and with whom he has worked in seven previous films. "The award is for the character I played, and that is the alter-ego of Pedro Almódovar. There is something of him here." Banderas added: "I thank him for the years, our movies together."
Beecham appeared somewhat nonplussed at her win, for Jessica Hausner's sci-fi parable Little Joe, saying she had been "overwhelmed" by the experience. "I had a kind of inkling this morning because I had a phone call from [Little Joe's] producer. I had to put my stuff in a backpack and get on a plane."

"Parasite" is a South Korean film directed by Bong Joon-Ho that first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 2019. Since then, it has received commercial and critical acclaim internationally.
At the 2019 Academy Awards, "Parasite" won awards for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature Film as well as winning Best Picture, the first non-English-language film to have won the award.
"Parasite" is about the Kim family, who live in extreme poverty, attempting to escape their current status in life. The movie is set off by a family friend of the Kims offering their son a job as an English tutor to a wealthy family, the Parks. The son of the Kim family gets the job, and then attempts to get his family jobs working for the Park family by replacing the current staff.
The other members of the Kim family pose as unrelated, highly skilled service workers, each being recommended by the previous family member hired. The Kim family replaces the staff by deceiving the Park family into thinking their previous staff are irresponsible or sickly. The tension in the film continues to rise until the very last second and leaves the audience shaken well after the story ends.
"Parasite" dips into so many different genres that it is hard to classify. There are elements of comedy, suspense, drama, horror and even several sequences that feel like they are straight out of a heist movie. Each element plays off each other; the comedic moments make the sections of tragedy and tension hit even harder.
There are obvious themes of economic disparity and class conflict at play throughout "Parasite." This is not Joon-Ho's first film that explores these themes, as his previous works "Snowpiercer" and "Okja" were also focused on similar ideas as those present in "Parasite."
Joon-Ho illustrates the disparity of wealth between the Parks and the Kims through masterful and subtle cinematography. Verticality plays a huge role in telling the story of "Parasite." The Kims' home is a half-basement apartment in the slums of the city, while the Parks live at a physically higher point in the city, literally above the rest of the residents.
Another scene that shows the financial gap between the two families comes during a downpour. The Parks' son is camping in a tent in their backyard during the storm, and the tent keeps him safe throughout the night. The Kims return to their apartment during the downpour to find that their home has been destroyed by flooding. Even the toys of the rich family surpass the best that the poor family can afford.
The morality of the characters within "Parasite" fall in something of a grey area. The Parks are not evil people; they do not ostentatiously flaunt their wealth in the eyes of the those who have less than them or treat them cruelly. The father of the Parks does, however, repeatedly mention in a "line" that those who work for him cannot cross. This shows his belief that the different classes cannot, or at least should not, exist in the same world.
For the part of the Kim family, they show solidarity to each other, but not to those in the same class as themselves. They are responsible for the Park family firing two workers, likely of the same economic situation as the Kims. During the flooding scene, a neighbor asks for help with his home from the Kims, but they ignore him.
Even the title has a double meaning. The initial reaction is to see the Kims as the parasite, leeching off the wealth of the Parks. However, it could also be read as the Parks parasitically using the labor of the lower classes to serve them.
The editing and pacing of "Parasite" are so well done that there is never a dull moment. No shot lingers for too long, or cuts too quickly. Scene transitions are done with purpose and oftentimes use the setting to transition creatively. A certain montage scene of the Kims framing the previous housekeeper sticks out as one of the best movie moments of 2019.
Subtle details and unique shot compositions make repeat viewings of this movie a great experience. It's possible to watch this movie a dozen times and catch a new detail of the story or meaning behind a scene with each viewing. This is how meticulous Joon-Ho was in the creation of his film.
This is absolutely a must-watch film. If you enjoy it and would like to see more from Joon-Ho, his previous films "Okja" and "Snowpiercer" are in English, deal with similar themes and are also excellent.

Feb 10, 2020( Den of Geek: http://www.denofgeek.com Delivered by Newstex)  David Crow[1] Feb 10, 2020 The world's turned upside down as Parasite becomes the first foreign language film to win the Oscar for Best Picture  There can be no other word other than respect crossing the minds of millions after Bong Joon-ho and the cast and crew of Parasite[2], made Oscar history on Sunday night by accepting the Best Picture award. It is the first time a foreign language film has ever achieved this honour. See related Doctor Who: what lies ahead?
[3] Doctor Who series 12: Alex Kingston talks potential River Song return[4] Netflix UK: what's new in February 2020?[5] Going into the night, there was a strong and vocal support for Parasite that extended from critics and fans alike, but precedence and history ran against the picture. Even after picking up the coveted Best Original Screenplay from the Writers Guild, the fact remains that no foreign language film has ever won Best Picture in its 92 years #8212; only five have even been nominated for the prize since 2000. Nonetheless, Parasite persevered and dominated in many of the categories it was nominated for throughout the night, winning all but two of the six categories it competed in. Among its other wins are Best Original Screenplay, Best International Film (renamed from #8216;Best Foreign Language Film#8217;) and Best Director. Indeed, Bong appeared genuinely astonished when he picked up the Best Director prize over the odds-on favorite, Sam Mendes, director of 1917. #8216;After winning Best International Feature, I thought I was done for the day and ready to relax,#8217; Bong had translated before the Academy. And yet, even then he was not done. He even had to deny the entire Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences when the Kodak Theatre stood on their feet and chanted #8216;Bong#8217;, requesting he take the mic. Instead, he left it to his impressive and impressed producers to accept the award. Parasite winning Best Picture is genuinely history being made. With no foreign language film having ever achieved the coup #8212; nor any film since Slumdog Millionaire in 2009 winning without acting nominations #8212; the odds were against the film about class, income inequality, and the agonies of capitalism breaking down what should ostensibly be a symbiotic relationship. It is also a reminder that the Academy is changing. Despite hand-wringing and perpetual wall-to-wall complaining on Twitter and social media, the Academy has transformed a tremendous amount in the 21st century[6], particularly in recent years. Parasite's triumvirate of wins in Picture, Director and Original Screenplay is indicative of this. But so is Joaquin Phoenix[7] taking home the Best Actor Oscar[8] for Joker[9]. While Heath Ledger won a posthumous Best Supporting Actor for the same role 11 years ago, the film he won it for, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight[10], was notably snubbed from even competing in Best Picture or Best Director. Conversely, Joker was the most nominated film of the night, and then picked up groundbreaking Oscars for the superhero movie genre: Best Actor and Best Original Score.

'Parasite' review: Worlds clash in Bong Joon-ho's masterful dark satire of class divide

Oct 21, 2019( The Today File: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/ Delivered by Newstex)  Movie review It's best to go into 'Parasite,' the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho ('Snowpiercer[1]'), not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. One of them — we never learn their last name — lives in a squalid basement apartment, dank and cluttered; all four members, including the grown son and daughter, are out of work, causing them to take desperation jobs like folding pizza boxes. 
The other family, the Parks, are wealthy, living in a vast, elegant home with green lawns and gleaming floors and a basement stocked with every imaginable need. These two families seem to be living in different worlds, and indeed they are: Our first glimpse of that basement apartment is the sight of socks and underwear hanging to dry by the grimy window; in the immaculate Park house, nothing dirty is ever seen. (A housekeeper is ever-present, but we never even see her cleaning.) But those two worlds connect, in the movie's early scenes: Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the oldest son of the unemployed family, forges some university documents to get a job tutoring the Parks' teenage daughter. Dazzled by the easy money, he encourages his sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) to likewise fake her credentials and get hired as an art therapist for the Parks' young son. [embedded content]  And then well, you'll just have to get pulled in, as I was, watching as a deception gets spun tighter and tighter until you're certain that something will snap, like a rubber band stretched beyond endurance. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong), and the way that Ki-woo's father (Song Kang-ho), a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. 'Parasite' — the title metaphor becomes abundantly clear — is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. His mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) corrects her son when he says Mrs. Park is 'rich, but nice' — she's nice, Chung-sook says, because she's rich. 'Money is an iron,' says this wise mother. 'It smooths out all the creases.' ____ 'Parasite,' with Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Chang Hyae-jin. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, from a screenplay by Bong and Han Jin-won. 131 minutes. Rated R for language, some violence and sexual content.In Korean, with English subtitles. Opens Oct. 25 at SIFF Cinema Egyptian. [ 1]: https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/lsquosnowpiercerrsquo-class-struggle-picks-up-speed-in-train-thriller/

Oscars 2020: Does Its Historic SAG Win Make 'Parasite' a Lock for Best Picture?

Jan 20, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Watch out because the Oscars might be taken over by Parasite.Going into this awards season, we're willing to bet a lot of casual moviegoers hadn't even heard of [1]Parasite[2]. The South Korean black comedy-thriller-drama from director/co-writer Bong Joon-ho (Snowpiercer, Okja) isn't exactly what most would consider mainstream entertainment. Or is it?At the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards[3], Parasite made history as the first foreign-language film[4] to win Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The award is essentially SAG's equivalent to Best Picture and is often considered a key predictor for who will win at the Oscars.So, with a SAG Award on its side, is Parasite now the bonafide Best Picture frontrunner?
 Not exactly. The cast of 'Parasite' at the Screen Actors Guild Awards | ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images'Parasite' has been a big winner this awards season Riding a wave of critical buzz — the film is 99 percent Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes — Parasite has been a mainstay throughout awards season. However, the film's combination of genres and tones could have made a successful Oscar bid a challenge. After all, the Academy Awards often overlook films it considers too offbeat for such a prestigious honor.Moreover, foreign-language films rarely make it into such high-profile contention. More often than not, such releases — no matter how beloved — are relegated to Best Foreign-Language Film, the category just renamed Best International Feature. In the past decade, only 2012's Amour and 2018's Roma have made it into the Best Picture race.So Parasite has already overcome several key obstacles on its way to some major Oscar wins. The film has even earned six nominations and the distinction of being the first South Korean movie nominated in its categories. No wonder HBO is jumping into the Parasite business, with an upcoming series based on the film[5]. America.#PARASITE[6] #SAGawards[7] pic.twitter.com/gb3kpsyKw3[8] — NEON (@neonrated) January 20, 2020[9] The SAG Award win strengthens its chances at the Oscars Going into the Oscars, insiders take into account all kinds of precursors. These include awards given out by critics' groups, highly publicized ceremonies such as the Golden Globes[10], and the guilds representing actors, directors, producers, and writers from within the industry. That last group of awards-voting bodies, in particular, can often be telling, as the academy's membership often carries a significant overlap.In that respect, Parasite could be in excellent shape going into the Oscars. Its cast's SAG Awards win underscores the film's growing momentum right now. However, in the last decade, only four of the films that won the SAG cast award went on to claim Best Picture at the Oscars. Support for Parasite is clearly in a groundswell right now, but fans of the movie shouldn't lock in their Oscar pools just yet.  Parasite: Award Acceptance Speech | 26th Annual SAG Awards | TNT[11] Oscar's biggest race could still go several different ways While Parasite has gained a bit more traction with its SAG win, the race is far from over right now. In fact, GoldDerby.com[12] has Parasite in a dead heat with two other Best Picture favorites. Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood[13] is still technically the frontrunner. But aside from Brad Pitt's inevitable Best Supporting Actor win, the film seems to be losing ground fast.;More and more, it feels like Best Picture could come down to Parasite and Sam Mendes' war drama 1917. Both Tarantino's film and 1917 won Golden Globes — for comedy and drama, respectively — but the latter also won Best Director at that ceremony. Moreover, 1917 beat both Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Parasite at the Producer's Guild of America Awards. Since PGA is the largest guild in the industry, 1917 arguably received a bigger boost than even Parasite's SAG win affords.Plus, since 1917 is by no means an ensemble piece, it makes sense why it wouldn't take the big SAG prize. In other words, Parasite has solidified its place among the top Best Picture players. But it's not over yet. Considering how Bong Joon-ho's movie has exceeded all expectations, we know better than to bet against it though. All eyes will be on what the director's and writer's guilds decide at their respective awards ceremonies.

'Parasite' Review: Your Expectations Will Be Exceeded, Without Even Knowing What to Expect

By Andrew Rodden
As I walked into the only theater in Colorado Springs showing Bong Joon-ho's bombastic drama-comedy-thrill- er movie "Parasite," my expectations were through the roof, even though I had no idea what to expect. I knew it was about a family, the Kims, who do their best to leech off of the resources and lifestyle of the wealthy Park family, and that the film won this year's highest honor at the Cannes film festival, but my knowledge of the film really boiled down to rumors and musings that claimed the 2019 release is easily one of the best movies of the decade. Of course, it is common practice to go into the theater without knowing much about the movie you bought tickets for, but I further implore readers to avoid as much information as you can about this movie before going to see it. Your experience will be monumentally elevated by doing so. The rumors and musings are so right: this movie is a must-watch, and it will surprise and delight at every twist and every turn.
The cinematic qualities of "Parasite" are some of the best I have ever experienced. The camera leads the viewer through the story, effectively contextualizing the characters within their spaces. The set and production design display the Park family and their interactions with the world in a clean, '50s-television-show style. Their home feels inauthentic, like an exhibit in a natural history museum, and this artificiality is painfully juxtaposed by the lived-in semi-basement apartment in which the Kims exist. The actors - led by the entrancing Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-Taek - convey their characters in an 'I couldn't take my eyes off of them' kind of way.
Perhaps the biggest takeaway from this movie is its urgent discussion about class, particularly how people navigate the obstacles placed in their path by society at large. For instance, the Park family physically distinguishes themselves from the Kims by asserting a difference in their smell. There are moments where the Parks literally turn up their noses at the "poor person" smell of the Kims. This reflects a particular attitude toward those deemed inferior: their inferiority is inextricably linked to their physical being. This perspective is sickening and dangerous, and I believe it is what fuels the machine of wealth and power inequality within society. It also embodies a main theme of the film: one's socioeconomic status is socially intended not to be breached, and to attempt a jump up leads to life-altering consequences.
Every frame of "Parasite" felt fresh. Bong Joon-ho was able to make this movie uniquely his own by employing his exciting style of moviemaking. Every moment creates a new layer and each gets better than the last. Not a single beat is wasted, and every clip is exploited for its full thematic potential. There are not even any "meh" moments in the movie. Everything is interconnected, the story is seamless, and the vision is singular. I'm envious of future film students who get to write their Film Studies 101 papers on this movie, as there is not a single point in the film where you cannot unpack engaging cinematographic and thematic content.
I cannot find a flaw in this movie. When you expend the raw effort it takes to fill each and every frame with such juicy and exciting content, and fill each character with charm and charisma and sadness and pain, you remove any available room for error. This is exactly what Joon-ho accomplished with "Parasite," and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future.
If I wasn't hitting you over the head with my trusty "recommendation mallet" before, allow me to square up my aim and take another swing: GO SEE THIS FILM.

'Parasite's Bong Joon-Ho Says Success Of Korean Dark Comedy In America Was A "Surprise" But "Inevitable"

On Sunday night, Bong Joon-Ho's            Parasite took home the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film, which adds to the success. The Neon dark comedy was immediately met with critical acclaim when it premiered at Cannes and from there, the buzz sustained throughout its festival run and when it was released in the United States it was a box office success.
The film became the best-reviewed movie of the year and was praised by critics and audiences, something that was unexpected for Bong.
"The film was released in October in the United States with box office results," he said backstage at the Golden Globes after his big win. "I was surprised but thought it was inevitable."
He added, "This film is about the rich and poor and about capitalism - and the U.S. is the heart of capitalism. I thought it was a natural response."
Joon Ho talked about how last year the celebrated the centennial of Korean Cinema with the release of Parasite and now they mark the 101st year with a Golden Globe win. "I am very happy to see these achievements year after year," he added.
Joining Bong onstage were actors Kang-ho Song and Jeong-eun Lee and he took the opportunity backstage to say how much of a joy it was to work with the ensemble. "While parasite has a very political and social message, it is such a familiar and universal story thanks to the incredible charm these actors have."

Bong Joon-ho's Parasite wins Palme d'Or at Cannes film festival; Black-comic thriller from South Korean director of Okja and Snowpiercer takes the top honours at the 72nd edition of the festival The awards - live!

Bong Joon-ho has won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for his black comic thriller Parasite.
The South Korean director is best known for previous films Okja and Snowpiercer, and earned rave reviews for his new film, which is about a poor family who insinuate themselves as servants into a much richer one. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw described it as "a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama [that] runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character".
Bong is the first Korean director to have won the top award at Cannes, after last appearing in competition with Okja in 2017. He is the second Asian winner in successive years, after Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda triumphed in 2018 with Shoplifters.
Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood left empty-handed despite widespread critical acclaim, as did another heavyweight director Ken Loach, whose gig-economy drama Sorry We Missed You had made a major impact at the beginning of the festival.
The awards ceremony is always brisk, compared to the Oscars, with little time for political pronouncements from the podium. However Fahrenheit 9/11 director Michael Moore, as he presented the jury prize, hit out at Donald Trump, quoting painter Pablo Picasso. "Art is the lie that enables us to realise the truth," he said, "Trump is the lie that enables us more lying." Moore added: "In dark times, art is what has helped save humanity from the autocrats and idiots."
The Grand Prix - considered the runners-up award - went to Senegalese director Mati Diop for Atlantique, a supernatural drama about African migrants. Diop had atttracted considerable attention before the festival as the first black woman to have a film selected for competition, and her film was a resounding critical success.
Antonio Banderas was a popular winner of the best actor award for Pedro Almodovar's Pain and Glory ; Banderas played a film-maker clearly modelled on Almodovar himself as he looks back over his career, in which memories of his mother (played by Penelope Cruz) loom large.
Emily Beecham - the British star of cult hit Daphne - won the best actress award for            Little Joe, a sci-fi parable directed by Austrian film-maker Jessica Hausner. She is the first British actor to win in this category since 1997, when Kathy Burke triumphed for her performance in the Gary Oldman-directed Nil by Mouth.
Brazilian film Bacurau and            French drama Les Misérables shared the third-place jury prize: the former was jointly directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelle and won plaudits for its anti Jair Bolsonaro message, while the latter, from first time feature director Ladj Ly, was much liked for its portrayal of tough French street life.
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the veteran Belgian film-makers who have previously won the Palme d'Or twice, took home the best director award for their radicalisation drama Young Ahmed, while Céline Sciamma, considered by many critics a strong contender for the Palme d'Or, was given best screenplay for her 18th-century-set lesbian romance Portrait of a Lady on Fire.
In a press conference after the awards ceremony, Bong thanked Cannes for the honour, saying: "It is the 100th anniversary of cinema in Korea this year. I think that Cannes has given Korean cinema a great gift." He also added that he was pleased to hear that the jury had unanimously voted for Parasite to win, and "as I am a real fan of films it is another reason to be pleased".
Bong deflected a suggestion that Parasite contained comments aimed at North Korea, saying that an impression of a North Korean TV anchor in the film was "just a small joke". "If North Koreans see my film one day, I think they will laugh."
In a press conference after the awards ceremony, Banderas joked that the win was "good news for his cardiologist" and thanked Almódovar, the director of Pain and Glory and with whom he has worked in seven previous films. "The award is for the character I played, and that is the alter-ego of Pedro Almódovar. There is something of him here." Banderas added: "I thank him for the years, our movies together."
Beecham appeared somewhat nonplussed at her win, for Jessica Hausner's sci-fi parable Little Joe, saying she had been "overwhelmed" by the experience. "I had a kind of inkling this morning because I had a phone call from [Little Joe's] producer. I had to put my stuff in a backpack and get on a plane."

IF SIX NOMINATIONS including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the increasingly homogenous American Academy Awards aren't sufficient testament, hopefully our review of one of the greatest movies we have seen in years will persuade you to go watch the Korean work of genius that is Parasite this weekend. And if you believe that opening gambit for an evaluation possesses all the subtlety of a tap dancing elephant, you are not mistaken. When we absolutely adore a picture we want you to know about it. Plus it's fitting for a film which, from minute one, sets out its stall making no attempt to disguise the twisty, quirky, amusing, thrilling tale it is about to sell you.
Let's try to fill you in on the plot without giving too much away. Officially termed a black comedy, Parasite opens on the Kim family - a highly intuitive yet down-on-their-luck working class clan comprising brother and sister, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and mother and father, Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) and Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). The story begins with the four sharing their cramped Seoul basement apartment searching every corner of the property for a glimmer of nearby WiFi signal to pilfer; the upstairs neighbours at that moment inconsiderately password-protecting their broadband and mobile provisions having long since been cut off. The siblings happen across a café's free service, only reachable from the bathroom, and the two crouch by the toilet downloading messages. Meanwhile mum and dad settle down to folding pizza boxes, from which the only current meagre income stems. Ki-woo's friend Min (Park Seo-joon) soon arrives and the Kims' lives will never be the same again.
Min, a college student and tutor, is moving abroad and suggests Ki-woo takes over his English teaching gig at a wealthy family's uptown pad. Despite his lack of qualifications (easily sorted with the help of sister Ki-jeong's Photoshop forgery skills), our charming hero lands the position and enters the Park household. Naïve but sweet matriarch Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) rules the roost, caring deeply for her teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jeong Ji-so) whom Ki-woo is going to instruct, and young son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). When it is discovered the primary school lad is in need of an art teacher, Ki-woo 'may just know a highly respected painter who could be available'... Enter Ki-jeong posing as a Chicago-trained art therapist and "friend of a friend" who breezily waltzes into the job. What's that? The Parks now need a new driver and housekeeper after a couple of backhanded incidents instigate sudden dismissals? The Kim parents (although their real identities are kept confidential) happen to be available and come to the rescue. Quick as a flash the cunning collective have fully implanted themselves into the Parks' lives, are living off generous salaries, and life couldn't be sweeter. That is until one night an unexpected guest threatens to reveal their ruse.
We have heard Parasite termed a 'heist movie' and we'd have to agree. Despite the lack of car chases and explosions, the first hour where the various scams are planned are up there with the great con films of our time. The acting across the board is so utterly on point, the Kim group phenomenally manage to pull a Breaking Bad and have you rooting for their nefarious deeds in an instant. As a result of motives not being too dastardly (opinions may vary) you don't mind the Parks being taken for a ride and can't help but hope the Kims' scheme isn't uncovered.
From a grander perspective, Parasite illustrates Korea's societal divisions of which we were unaware. Having only really been superficially exposed to the wealthier elite aspects of the country's more modern culture (here embodied by the Parks), it was inevitable there would be those left behind and it was refreshing to see them represented on the big screen through the Kims in a comedic yet nuanced manner. It is a credit to Bong Joon-ho's direction and writing we came away from his movie not only having been thoroughly entertained, but also enlightened.
Our rating: 4.5/5

Bong Joon-Ho On 'Parasite's "Crucial And Sharp" Message & Its Surprising Cannes Premiere: "It Felt Like A Live Concert"
Deadline
January 3, 2020

From the moment of Parasite's world premiere in Cannes, in which a usually stoic European audience hooted and hollered at            Bong Joon-ho's movie's twists and turns as though it was a midnight screening in Austin, the film's trajectory has been breakneck. It would go on to win the Palme d'Or, before traveling to festivals the world over and being greeted by audiences with as much fervor as those first screenings. Now, director Bong is nominated for Best Director at the Globes, and Parasite looks set to break out of the international feature race and into Oscar's main competition.
DEADLINE: Is it true that Parasite began as a play?
BONG JOON-HO: It is true that I first conceived of this idea as theater, but from the very beginning, it didn't work out that way. From the first line, I was already thinking about the camera positions. I just realized that I had to do this as a film, as always.
DEADLINE: Where did you get the idea? 
JOON-HO: Actually, in the case of The Host, one of my previous movies, I had a very clear beginning point. But in this case, it's much harder to describe how and when it came to be. It was something like a parasite; it was already inside. I just kind of discovered it. Normally, we don't know when and how a parasite comes into us, so it was a quite similar thing.
In 2013, during the post-production of Snowpiercer, I have a very clear, early memory of describing this story to someone else. A story about two families-one rich, one poor-where the poor family infiltrates the rich house, at the very beginning.
DEADLINE: Frequently in your films, you plant thematic material to explore within allegory, or within a certain genre. What comes first, the theme or the genre?
JOON-HO: I never really define the genre that I want the story to be in, or what metaphors or symbols I should place within the story. I always just want to depict very interesting and entertaining situations. I move through impulses.
Actually, in the movie, when the young son gets that strange, colored stone, he himself says, "Wow, this is very metaphorical." [laughs] Usually, it's the film critics who say, "Wow, that was so metaphorical," but you have the actor up there, announcing it himself. So, it's very strange. That stone becomes something very important in the film, and I tend to not like symbols. I wanted this film to feel more physical.
DEADLINE: It's true, though, that the film explores deep themes like socioeconomic inequality. Is striking this kind of balance between meaning and entertainment important for you?
JOON-HO: For me, instinctively, humor and fun are like the air I breathe. Whenever I work, there's always humor, and alongside that comes drama. I always try to maintain those elements, but I always want to hide some very sharp blade inside the social message, or something political. Something very crucial and sharp is inside there, to spark the audience's thought.
DEADLINE: From your perspective, is the message of Parasite for Korea, or something more global?
JOON-HO: Very global, very universal. It's almost everywhere, in any country. On the surface, there's so many funny, very Korean details; so many Korean nuances. But it's very strongly, firmly based on a universal subject and theme.
DEADLINE: How did the Kims and the Parks come together in your mind? 
JOON-HO: It was like laying bricks, one-by-one. So, the Kim family is unemployed. They're completely capable and smart, but they just don't have jobs, and that's the sad part. They're poor, but at the same time, they're very intimate. They like to spend time with one another. And then the rich family, the Parks, was mirrored off of the poor family-four family members, one to one, daughter and son. But they're rarely together.
DEADLINE: The rich house feels like an island; isolated above all the poorer structures below. 
JOON-HO: The rich house is a very important element in the film, and I really discussed it a lot with the production designer, Ha-jun Lee. Of course, the house has a lot of secrets. When we see it for the first time, it has to feel extravagant and beautiful, but it also has to feel like it doesn't carry any secrets, so that it's surprising.
DEADLINE: Dark, gothic, classical houses often major roles in horror movies. By contrast, the rich house in Parasite is bright and modern. Were you deliberately subverting what we expect?
JOON-HO: Yeah, that is what I intended. Of course, the house is the work of a very famous architect, and it features in a very elegant way in the film. You first begin with bright sunlight, and then you delve deeper into the darkness of the house, like you're going inside a cave. The horror element really comes into the picture in the latter half of the film. At first, it just looks like a really beautiful estate.
Because 90% of the film happens in the rich house, with the poor house below, ever since I started writing the script, I did a lot of sketches of the basic structures. So, when I finished the script and handed it to the production designer, I also handed him my sketches, and told him that these structures were necessary for the blocking.
But the production designer had to consult an actual architect to design this house, and when the architect saw my sketches, he was like, "No idiot would build houses this way. This is ridiculous." So, the production designer came back to me and I kept saying, "I need this structure! I need this blocking line."
But the production designer was incredible. He suffered, in between me and the architect. But in the end, he managed to get approval from the architect, while giving me everything that I wanted and required. The house came out amazing.
DEADLINE: What was it like to share Parasite for the first time at its Cannes premiere?
JOON-HO: I was very shocked at Cannes. They applauded in the middle of the movie, two times. It was very strange. Then, after that in places like Sydney and Hanoi and Toronto, the same thing happened, again and again. At the end of that one sequence, when Song [Kang-ho] brings out the bloody tissue paper, people started clapping. It was a very strange feeling; it felt like a live concert.
DEADLINE: You'd had strange experiences in Cannes before. When you premiered Okja there in 2017, the film got caught up in the controversy surrounding Netflix's first time on the Croisette.
JOON-HO: Yeah, exactly. It was very hard to talk about the movie itself. People were always talking about the streaming thing, the tension between the French theater industry and streaming services. It's very much better to be talking about the film this time around.
Okja was my first time in competition, so that's something. But because the controversy was so severe, it was an exhausting experience. In Toronto this year, I met director Noah Baumbach. At Cannes in 2017, his movie The Meyerowitz Stories was the other Netflix movie in competition, so we shared the same situation. He's made another movie with Netflix this year, of course. I asked him, "How's this year?" He said he was having a great time and it's getting better and better. Netflix is now more flexible, so Marriage Story is showing for longer in theaters, exclusively, before streaming. I think at the time, 2017, the feeling was it was too early.
I really want to work with Netflix again, if I have a chance. It was a great experience. They gave me 100%, total creative control to release my director's cut, which is quite rare in this industry.
DEADLINE: I had wondered if the Netflix/Cannes debate, on top of your experiences with Harvey Weinstein on Snowpiercer, would put you off of the idea of working in America again.
JOON-HO: I consider Netflix great friends, and working on Snowpiercer and Okja has given me the opportunity to work and communicate with a lot of filmmakers and actors from Europe and the U.S. So now, I have a wider range of collaborators with whom I can work, and I will continue making Korean films like Parasite, also. But actually, I'm just very dependent on the story, what kind of story I'm going to make. That's the basic thing, not where I'll make it. It's not like, "Oh, one film, I'll do in the U.S., and one film, I'll do in Korea."

Amazon Prime Video has announced that Bong Joon-ho’s Best Picture Oscar winner Parasite is coming to the streaming service this month. 
•	Read more: Parasite review: Bong Joon-ho’s darkly comic thriller is a modern masterpiece (yes, even with subtitles)
Sharing the names of several titles that will be coming to Amazon Prime in the UK throughout October, the streamer also revealed that Sam Mendes’ war drama 1917 would be added to the service. 
1917 will arrive on October 16, with Parasite following on October 23. On Thursday (October 1), Eddie The Eagle – which is based on the life and career of former Olympic ski jumper Michael Edwards – landed on the platform, while Quentin Tarantino’s star-studded World War II drama Inglourious Basterds and Amy Schumer’s I Feel Pretty were added yesterday (October 2). 
With Halloween approaching, subscribers will be privy to Blumhouse outings The Lie and Black Box, which both land on October 6, while Nocturne and Evil Eye will be available to stream from October 13. 
Brahms: The Boy 2, which stars Katie Holmes as Liza who becomes increasingly troubled by her young son’s attachment to a doll they found in the woods, arrives on October 21. 
Other titles include The Personal History Of David Copperfield, Smallfoot, Color Out Of Space and Crazy, Stupid, Love.
Meanwhile, a black and white version of Parasite was released earlier this year.
Giving Parasite a five-star review, NME wrote: “Part of the brilliance of Parasite is that, while this is an ‘us vs them’ story, it doesn’t pick a side.      
“Instead, Bong puts the flaws of both families on full display – each is as parasitical as the other, the Kims burrowing their way into the Parks’ house under false pretences and the Parks subtly exploiting the Kims while making disparaging comments about them that give themselves a sense of superiority.” 
Parasite took home Best International Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director for Bong Joon-ho, and Best Picture at the 2020 Oscars. It became the first South Korean movie to win an Oscar and the first non-English language film to take home Best Picture.

Parasite review - searing satire of a family at war with the rich; Members of an unemployed family target a wealthy household in Bong Joon-ho's superbly written, horribly fascinating comedy-drama

Star Rating: 5 stars
Bong Joon-ho's satirical suspense thriller Parasite has arrived in the UK from Korea, in all its delicious cruelty and ingenuity, having won the Palme d'Or in Cannes last year and dominated the connoisseur conversation from then on - at the expense, rightly or wrongly, of every other non-English-language film.
This really is a horribly fascinating film, brilliantly written, superbly furnished and designed, with a glorious ensemble cast put to work in an elegantly plotted nightmare. Its narrative engine hums with the luxurious smoothness of the Mercedes-Benz that one character is fatefully given the chance to drive. In my original           review from Cannes, I wondered if the narrative was a little over-extended, but, on a second viewing, I can see how that amplitude of detail is what gives the film its flavour.
Parasite is a scabrous black comedy-slash-farce that resonates beyond its generic limits - a movie about status envy, aspiration, materialism, the patriarchal family unit and the idea of having (or leasing) servants. More than this, it is about the suppressed horror of the overclass for its underlings and its morbid distaste for the smell of people who have to use public transport. The satirical reflex extends to a vision of South and North Korea living together in paranoid, resentful intimacy, and its climax is precipitated by an almost Biblical climate-emergency catastrophe.
The parasites in question are a dodgy unemployed family living together in a scuzzy, stinky basement flat, with the teenage son and daughter periodically roaming around, holding their smartphones up to the ceiling to pinch the non-password-protected wifi of neighbours and nearby businesses. The dad is Ki-taek (a lovely performance from veteran player Song Kang-ho), a laidback loafer married to former track star Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin). The son is Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), a shiftless young guy who has flunked the university entrance exams; and the daughter is Ki-jung (Park So-dam), a smart, cool customer with an artistic gift for web-based fraud.
One summer, by posing as a college student, Ki-woo gets the chance to tutor the teenage daughter of a very rich family in a spectacularly grand modernist house, owned by business high-flier Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun). Ki-woo's student is the demure Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), whose instant crush on him is something Ki-woo does nothing to discourage. The somewhat distraite mistress of the house, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), asks if this smart young man might also recommend an art tutor for Da-hye's negligibly talented kid brother Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). He passes off his sister as the cousin of a friend and her brazen grifter-sense of when and how to be confident, and even arrogant, bags her the job.
Soon, these wicked kids have cunningly contrived to get the family chauffeur fired and replaced with their dad. They then dislodge the housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun) and install their placidly smiling mum. A whole family of cuckoos in a brand new nest, pretending to be strangers to each other. But then the artless little kid points out that they all smell alike - and they smell of poor people.
Parasite is a movie that taps into a rich cinematic tradition of unreliable servants with an intimate knowledge of their employers, an intimacy that easily, and inevitably, congeals into hostility. Joseph Losey's The Servant invokes a comparable transgression, nightmarishly amplified here by the subterfuge and by the sheer numbers of people getting up close and personal.
Parasite is also in a Korean tradition of pictures such as Kim Ki-young's classic thriller The Housemaid from 1960, remade in 2010 by Im Sang-soo, and also Park Chan-wook's servant-class con-trick drama, The Handmaiden. A second viewing of this film also put me in mind of the claustrophobic horror in Park's            Oldboy.
And there is something else, too. The Park family love to play Handel on the music system in their lovely home - the Spietati, io vi giurai aria from his opera Rodelinde. It is so expansive, so airy, caressingly sumptuous and wealthy, and not a million miles from the Care selve arioso from Handel's Atalanta - listened to by the smug wealthy couple in Michael Haneke's home-invasion horror Funny Games, before their own appointment with dark destiny.
The home invaders here gaze on their super-rich employers and see themselves in a distorting mirror that pitilessly reveals to them how wretched they are and shows them what could and should be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story: the invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its toxic tendrils into your skin.
 Parasite is released in the UK on 7 February.

2020 Oscar Predictions: #8216;Parasite' and #8216;1917' Should Win Big

Feb 06, 2020( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  This year's Oscar race is defined by a diversified Academy membership, now nearing 20 percent international; a shortened award season that put increased pressure on the Academy members to sample all the nominees, often online; and the always-confusing preferential ballot. Rankings of nine Best Picture contenders aside, this year's selections fell into defined categories that often overlapped: box-office hits, actor showcases, craft achievements, and Netflix releases. Other crucial (and classic) assets for an Oscar winner include hitting the zeitgeist and sending a message to the world. In the decade since adopting the preferential ballot, the Academy has leaned into message movies like #8216;12 Years a Slave,#8217; #8216;Spotlight,#8217; #8216;The Shape of Water,#8217; #8216;Moonlight,#8217; and #8216;Green Book#8217; — despite their modest box office — over feel-good entertainments such as #8216;La La Land#8217; and #8216;A Star is Born#8217; or big-scale visual epics like #8216;The Revenant,#8217; #8216;Mad Max: Fury Road,#8217; #8216;Dunkirk,#8217; and #8216;Gravity.#8217; Tallying guild wins still offers insight into Academy voters, but since 2016 the Academy has actively altered its membership far more than any of the guilds, including the oft-predictive SAG, PGA, DGA, WGA, and BAFTA. 
The Academy may be less L.A.-centric, and predominantly white male, than those organizations, but it is still dominated by older white men who live in Hollywood, many of whom voted last year for middle-of-the-road, feel-good studio entry #8216;Green Book.#8217; Only 32 percent of the Academy[1] is women and 16 percent is nonwhite, a figure that includes European Spanish speakers. However, if the Academy is still dominated by thesteakeater vote,[2] it's spread around several movies, including nominations leader Todd Phillips' divisive, Venice Golden-Lion winning #8216;Joker#8217; (11 nods), which should easily take Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix. Also in that number: James Mangold's racecar spectacular #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; (four noms), which should win some tech nods, most likely the two sound categories; and Martin Scorsese's mafia-vs.-Hoffa saga #8216;The Irishman#8217; (10 nominations, Netflix), which could go home empty handed. Two other popular movies will draw that mainstream vote: #8216;1917[3]#8217; and #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,#8217; with 10 nominations each. Heading into the home stretch, they are duking it out for Best Picture with Bong Joon Ho's Korean-movie-that-could #8216;Parasite[4]#8217; (six nominations). The Cannes Palme d'Or, SAG, and WGA-winning #8216;Parasite#8217; could break the long-held conventional wisdom that a subtitled foreign-language movie cannot win Best Picture (it has failed to happen 11 times, including last year's #8216;Roma#8217;). While it's easy to measure the movie's word-of-mouth popularity and box-office traction[5] ($165.4 million worldwide), will mainstream older voters recognize an out-of-the-box story about a family of con-artists — especially when the movie can also win Best International Feature Film? The answer: They could, even if that's not their express desire. It all comes down to that confounding preferential ballot. If enough people rank #8216;Parasite#8217; high on their ballots (it is not true that only the top two votes count), it could win Best Picture. The movie could also pick up wins for director, original screenplay, production design, and editing. More than any other nominee, #8216;Parasite#8217; hits the zeitgeist with its portrayal of the global class struggle between the haves and have-nots; it may be time to break this Oscar rule. Sam Mendes' continuous-shot World War I drama #8216;1917#8217; won the Drama Globe, PGA, DGA, and BAFTA, and has box-office momentum[6] as well as anti-war gravitas behind it. Oddly, the film is viewed by some as a mainstream conventional choice, and others as an innovative technological feat. DGA winner Mendes and ASC winner Roger Deakins should both win their second Oscars[7] for direction and cinematography, respectively, along with other possible craft wins. The movie is passionately admired, its message unassailable, and actors recognize what its two young rising stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman accomplished over multiple long takes. #8216;1917#8217; could win. Quentin Tarantino's summer hit #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; won the Critics Choice Award and boasts broad support from actors, writers, and crafts. Like #8216;A Star is Born#8217; last year, this much-beloved show business fable peaked early and lost some mojo, except for inevitable Supporting Actor sweeper Brad Pitt and Tarantino's possible third screenplay win, along with some crafts. But there is real affection for this inside-Hollywood movie, which Academy members well understand — which is why #8216;The Artist#8217; and #8216;Birdman#8217; both won Best Picture. Triple-threat New Zealander Taika Waititi's archly humorous WGA and BAFTA-winner #8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217; (six nominations) stands a strong chance in several categories, including Adapted Screenplay and Costume (the latter of which also marks the most likely win out of the six nominations for #8216;Little Women#8217;). Don't forget, #8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217; won the predictive Toronto People's Choice Award; it's unlikely to repeat the #8216;Green Book#8217; Best Picture win, but it's also a mainstream favorite. Its fans will want it to win something. Losing momentum is nominations leader Netflix (24 nominations), which continues to come under fire[8] for its awards strategy. Certainly studios are angry at the disruptive streamer's willingness to outspend them on movies they weren't willing to support at a high level, such as Martin Scorsese's $160-million, VFX-loaded, three-and-a-half hour gangster epic #8216;The Irishman.#8217; But the evolving Netflix release model (launch a movie at film festivals, a three-week platform release in arthouses, expand onto the global streaming platform) meant that at the end of the Oscar season, #8216;The Irishman,#8217; Noah Baumbach's divorce dramedy #8216;Marriage Story#8217; (six nominations) and Fernando Meirelles' theological debate #8216;The Two Popes#8217; (three) all lost steam — no matter how hard the Netflix awards team tried to keep them in the conversation via fluffy sofa throws or red pope slippers[9]. While Netflix won three out of 10 Oscars for #8216;Roma#8217; last year, this time it may have to settle for Supporting Actress Laura Dern in #8216;Marriage Story#8217; and their third documentary win, for #8216;American Factory.#8217; Not winning any popularity contests are the leaders of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences who decreed a three-weeks-shorter Oscar season, with the show taking place on February 9. Voters rushed to view animated, foreign-language, documentary, and short films, and crashed the Oscars website the day before ballots were due. Many members complained about not being able to see everything in time, as well as having to watch so many films online. They weren't warned that they would no longer be sent the DVD shorts package, and members who did not have Apple TV had to watch many entries on their computers. Luckily, Oscar dates return to their late-February normal next year. First-time Oscar producers Stephanie Allain and Lynnette Howell Taylor inherited last year's successful no-host model, and remained controversy-free by not taking any radical steps to shorten the three-hour broadcast. Like last year, ABC should be happy with ratings, as a popular slate of contenders led by $1 billion worldwide grosser #8216;Joker#8217; could be a real draw. One downside of the rise of international Oscar voters is that they are mainly white Europeans, which may partly account for the lack of diversity in this year's nominees. To counteract this, the producers have invited a number of presenters and performers of color, including the only black acting nominee, singer-actress Cynthia Erivo, who will perform her nominated song from #8216;Harriet,#8217; nominee Taika Waititi (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;), past winners Mahershala Ali and Regina King, and singer Janelle Monae, among others. May you win your Oscar pool. My final list of picks in 24 categories is below: Best Picture: #8216;Parasite#8217; Spoiler: #8216;1917″ Bottom Line:The much-debated preferential ballot — each voter ranks the nine nominees in order of preference — all comes down to the movies 8,469 Academy voters actually saw and loved the most, and which film aligns with the zeitgeist to deliver the (socially relevant) message that voters want to send. These factors favor SAG Ensemble and WGA-winner #8216;Parasite.#8217; I'm sticking with the fact that Bong nabbed the biggest applause at the Academy nominees luncheon. Best Director: Sam Mendes (#8216;1917#8217;) Spoiler: Bong Joon Ho (#8216;Parasite#8217;) In recent years the directing Oscar has gone to the most extraordinary technical achievement, from Ang Lee's VFX-winner #8216;Life of Pi,#8217; Alfonso Cuaron's #8216;Gravity#8217; and #8216;Roma,#8217; to A.G. Inarritu's #8216;The Revenant.#8217; If any narrative can upset DGA-winner Mendes' astonishing continuous-take drama about two young soldiers pressing forward to the front line under fire to deliver a life-saving message, it's Bong's breakout #8216;Parasite.#8217; If it wins this award, #8216;1917#8217; will likely take Best Picture. Best Actor: Joaquin Phoenix (#8216;Joker#8217;) Spoiler: Adam Driver (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;) Bottom Line: Phoenix is on a tear and is considered crucial to the success of #8216;Joker,#8217; even to the point of improvising key scenes on set with Phillips and cinematographer Lawrence Sher — and driving his hair and makeup team crazy. But he campaigned like a pro, throwing his authentic political beliefs into the mix[10] in a positive way. But Driver is this year's respected thespian emoter: Charlie not only breaks down movingly at the feet of his estranged wife (Scarlett Johansson), but alsosings Stephen Sondheim's #8216;Being Alive.#8217; Driver is young and has many Oscar chances ahead of him. Best Actress: ReneZellweger (#8216;Judy#8217;) Spoiler: Scarlett Johansson (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;) Bottom Line:After four nominations and one win (#8216;Cold Mountain#8217;), Globe, SAG, Critics Choice and BAFTA sweeper Zellweger, 50, has the career advantage; voters who checked out #8216;Judy#8217; did not find her wanting. After never having been nominated before, Johansson landed two nods, as an actress divorcing her director husband in #8216;Marriage Story,#8217; and as a young Nazi's activist mother in #8216;Jojo Rabbit.#8217; Both Best Picture contenders scored better reviews than #8216;Judy,#8217; but Zellweger's comeback narrative[11] is irresistible. Best Supporting Actor: Brad Pitt (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Spoiler: Anthony Hopkins (#8216;The Two Popes#8217;) Bottom Line: Nobody can possibly catch up with Pitt's performance as moccasin-wearing zen stuntman Cliff Booth, nor his awards circuit charm offensive[12] (including witty, self-deprecating speeches — his ghost writer earned their fee — and hand-holding with his ex, Jennifer Aniston). While #8216;The Two Popes#8217; is an unsung actor-fest that many voters love, Oscar voters want this key win for #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Best Supporting Actress: Laura Dern (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;) Spoiler: Scarlett Johansson (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;) Bottom Line: Again, Hollywood scion Dern has swept all the precursor races on the strength of her performance as a hard-as-nails feminist lawyer — a performance buttressed by her strong showings in a second Best Picture nominee, #8216;Little Women,#8217; and HBO Emmy-winner #8216;Big Little Lies.#8217; Again, first-time dual nominee Johansson effortlessly delivers a strong German accent, period costumes, and heartbreak as Jojo's tragic mom. If there's a surprise this year, this could be it. Best Original Screenplay: Quentin Tarantino (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Spoiler: Bong Joon Jo (#8216;Parasite#8217;) Tarantino's tone-shifting showbiz dialogue in the elegiac, utterly original #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; deserves the win. It's close, though: It would be his third win in this category, and while Tarantino wasn't eligible for the WGA award because he never joined, he could have used the momentum boost that went to Bong. Especially if voters withhold the Best Picture win, they may want Bong to win another big award. Best Adapted Screenplay: Taika Waititi (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;) Spoiler: Greta Gerwig (#8216;Little Women#8217;) Bottom Line:Again, two narratives are duking it out: the brilliantly constructed Louisa May Alcott adaptation penned by actress-writer-director and Critics' Choice winner Gerwig, who gains sympathy by being denied a director's nod (see Ben Affleck and #8216;Argo#8217;), and the brilliantly constructed Hitler satire from actor-writer-director and WGA and BAFTA-winner Waititi, who also gains sympathy by being denied a director's nod. Both films are commercial hits, and both screenwriters are able self-promoters with diversity cred. Best Animated Feature: #8216;Toy Story 4″ Spoiler: #8216;Klaus#8217; Bottom Line: It seemed like a done deal that Josh Cooley would win for Pixar's latest #8216;Toy Story#8217; sequel, which managed to surpass the Oscar-winning third installment. But somehow, other movies have been winning. New animation competitor Netflix took the Annie Awards with hand-drawn Christmas origin myth #8216;Klaus,#8217; while their adult French Cannes pickup #8216;I Lost By Body#8217; has been promoted by last year's winners, Phil Lord and Chris Miller (#8216;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse#8217;). While some feel that the Oscars should share the love, and Pixar has won enough, the smaller films could weed each other out, leaving the most popular title in the lead: #8216;Toy Story 4.#8217; Best Animated Short: #8216;Hair Love#8217; Spoiler:#8216;Memorable#8217; Bottom Line: The advantage[13] goes to the most-accessible entry, which this year is the 2D #8216;Hair Love,#8217; which poignantly tells the story of a father bonding with his daughter on a bad-hair day. Financed via Kickstarter and acquired by Sony Pictures Animation, it's directed by black filmmaker Matthew Cherry and animated by Everett Downing Jr. (#8216;Up,#8217; #8216;WALLE#8217;) and Bruce Smith (creator of #8216;The Proud Family#8217;). On the other hand, Academy voters may relate to Bruno Collet's moving French stop-motion short #8216;Memorable,#8217; which is both well-wrought and artful, as it uses a painterly palette to portray an artist's descent into Alzheimer's. Best Cinematography: Roger Deakins (#8216;1917#8217;) Spoiler: Robert Richardson (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Bottom Line: Deakins deserves huge credit for his collaboration with Mendes on this supremely challenging technological and artistic feat. In any other year, Richardson would walk home with the win for helping Tarantino pull off so many tone shifts for 1969 Hollywood. Best Costume Design: Jacqueline Durran (#8216;Little Women#8217;) Spoiler: Arianne Phillips (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Bottom Line: Given that #8216;Little Women#8217; boasts a colorful range of period costumes, it has emerged as the frontrunner in this category, even without a Costume Designers Guild mention. This could be the film's designated Oscar win. Or, voters may prefer the evocative, now-iconic 1969 costumes for #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Best Documentary Feature: #8216;American Factory#8217; Spoiler:#8216;For Sama#8217; Bottom Line: Cancer survivor Julia Reichert and her life and filmmaking partner Steven Bognar delivered a definitive and revealing essay on the culture clash inside a Chinese-owned glass factory in Ohio. In a competitive field, the likeliest film to challenge the win is IDA-winner #8216;For Sama,#8217; which chronicles a young family under siege in Aleppo. But gorgeously wrought dual nominee, Macedonian #8216;Honeyland,#8217; is also beloved. Best Documentary Short: #8216;Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone (If You're a Girl)#8217; Spoiler: #8216;In the Absence#8217; Bottom Line:Voters respond to the heart-tugging joy of unfettered girls in #8216;Learning to Skateboard in a War Zone.#8217; But #8216;In the Absence,#8217; the story of how the Korean government let trapped passengers in a sinking ferry die, is both well made and haunting. Best Editing: #8216;Parasite#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; Bottom Line: If the complex dual-family multi-genre structures of #8216;Parasite#8217; win early on Oscar night, there could be more gold statuettes in the offing. But the orchestrated action suspense of #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; also deserves a win. Neither one-shot #8216;1917#8217; nor #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; landed a nomination, another sign of strength for #8216;Parasite.#8217; Best International Feature Film: #8216;Parasite#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Pain & Glory#8217; Bottom Line:Many voters want to spread the love, but more will have seen #8216;Parasite,#8217; which would mark a first win for Korea. That's hard to beat. Even though Pedro Almodovar's #8216;Pain & Glory#8217; earned a Best Actor nomination for Cannes prizewinner Antonio Banderas, that doesn't reflect the entire Academy, who don't all watch the foreign films. #8216;Parasite,#8217; they saw. Best Live Action Short:#8216;Brotherhood#8217; Spoiler:#8216;A Sister#8217; Bottom Line:Of the families-in-jeopardy shorts, Meryam Joobeu's #8216;Brotherhood,#8217; about a young man returning home to his angry father after fighting with ISIS in Syria, is movingly directed, but Delphine Girard's thriller #8217;A Sister,#8217; about a policewoman trying to save a young woman in danger over the phone, is the one that is not like the others. Best Makeup and Hairstyling: #8216;Bombshell#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Joker#8217; Bottom Line: The Best Actress contender gets the win, given all the high praise for the transformation of Charlize Theron into Fox News anchorwoman Megyn Kelly. But many folks don't like that movie, and the #8216;Joker#8217; makeup and hairstyling team earned extra points for managing their volatile star. Best Production Design: Barbara Ling (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;) Spoiler: Dennis Gassner (#8216;1917#8217;) Bottom Line: This one is close. Many are lauding the hand-in-hand coordinated effort required for Mendes, Deakins, and Gassner to lay out and build their extraordinary long take shots. But Ling's recreation of many different sides of 1969 Hollywood won the Art Directors Guild award for period, while #8216;Parasite#8217; took contemporary, which doesn't usually win in this category. If either film wins both Production Design and Best Picture, they will be the first to win both. Best Original Score: Hildur Guonadottir (#8216;Joker#8217;) Spoiler: Thomas Newman (#8216;1917#8217;) Bottom Line: First-time nominee Guonadottir's jarring modern #8216;Joker#8217; score is so strong (even influencing Phoenix's performance) that it could beat #8216;1917#8217; composer Thomas Newman, who is long overdue after 13 nominations and no wins. Best Original Song: #8216;I'm Gonna Love Me Tonight#8217; (Elton John and Bernie Taupin, #8216;Rocketman#8217;) Spoiler: #8216;Stand Up#8217; (Cynthia Erivo, #8216;Harriet#8217;) Bottom Line: While Tony, Grammy and Emmy-winner Erivo is well on her way to EGOT status, this is Elton John's win for the hugely popular but under-recognized biopic musical #8216;Rocketman.#8217; Best Sound Editing: #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; Spoiler: #8216;1917#8217; Bottom Line: Both sound teams faced challenges as they found way to innovate under duress. I'm going with the sound guild-winning percussive sound design for the #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; races, but this one is hard to call. Best Sound Mixing: #8216;Ford v Ferrari#8217; Spoiler: #8216;1917#8217; Bottom Line: Again, the guild-winning sound team went beyond the call of duty as they recorded the interiors of arcane vintage race cars. But #8216;1917#8217; was also a sound-mixing feat. Best Visual Effects: #8216;1917#8217; Spoiler: #8216;Avengers: Endgame#8217; Bottom Line: After #8216;Black Panther,#8217; Marvel has developed a taste for awards, and campaigned for #8216;Endgame.#8217; #8216;Infinity Wars#8217; lost last year, so there may be votes this time for the finale, as Thanos and Hulk are among the great animated characters of all time — not to mention that big-scale battle. Finally, though, while the effects in #8216;1917#8217; are less showy and more invisible, they were essential to pulling off the seamless movie, from completing the production design to hurling George MacKay into a raging river to throwing an exploding airplane into a barn. Like last year's VFX winner #8216;First Man,#8217; the classier movie could take the win.

The most exciting movies of 2020 - foreign language; Paul Verhoeven plays the provocateur, bloody excess hits Brazil's wild west and Bong Joon-ho's Parasite finally invades these shores More of the most anticipated films of 2020

                   The Whistlers                   
A bent detective becomes entangled in the crimes he's investigating in Corneliu Porumboiu's nifty, twisty drama. This one premiered at Cannes last year and should wash up in the UK in the spring.
                   The Truth                   
Hirokazu Kore-eda 's Cannes opener was a curious choice for his first film set outside Japan: a full-throttle French country house dame-fest featuring Catherine Deneuve and Juliette Binoche as a bickering mother and daughter. Ethan Hawke plays Binoche's husband, who looks on as they let rip with the Gallic quips.
                   Bacurau                   
Kleber Mendonça Filho's wacko western unfolds in a small Brazilian town whose population unravels following the death of its matriarch. Sônia Braga and Udo Kier star in a gory story that mixes genre excess with hard-hitting social commentary.
                   Druk                   
Thomas Vinterberg, Mads Mikkelsen and pretty much the entire cast and crew of The Hunt reunite for this boozy movie about a group of high-school teachers who share the theory that mild intoxication would make them more open-minded. So they all pledge to try and be slightly drunk throughout the workday. It works better for some of them than others.
                   Pinocchio                   
Matteo Garrone directs Roberto Benigni as Mister Geppetto, the father of the little wooden lad with the expanding nose, in this grand fantasy populated by venerable Italian actors voicing crows, weasels, fairies and a gorilla.
                   Benedetta                   
A nun in full wimple and white cloak allowing for just a flash of nipple is the revealing poster for Paul Verhoeven's first film since Elle. Based on much-thumbed 1986 library staple Immodest Acts: The life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy, this is a 17th-century convent romance featuring Virginie Efira, Daphne Patakia - and Charlotte Rampling, obviously.
                   Ema                   
Pablo Larraín's acclaimed thriller stars Gael García Bernal and Mariana di Girolamo as a couple dealing with the aftermath of a botched adoption. This is a film full of threads left hanging and questions unanswered, a card-shuffle of blame and responsibility with an ace up its sleeve.
                   An Officer and a Spy                   
Roman Polanski's latest doesn't currently have a UK release, but we're assuming the cracker reviews for his Dreyfuss affair drama will at some point mean a distributor takes the bait. Jean Dujardin and Louis Garel star.
                   Weathering With You                   
An early-January release date is set for Makoto Shinkai's acclaimed anime about a Tokyo boy who befriends an orphaned girl apparently able to control the weather. This has been a major box-office draw in its homeland and a big hit with international critics, who have compared it to Spirited Away in its emotional power.
                   Portrait of a Lady on Fire                   
The second-best reviewed film of 2019 makes it to UK screens in February: Céline Sciamma's 18th-century romance between a woman and the female artist commissioned to paint her picture by her nobleman fiance. Adèle Haenel - Sciamma's former partner - plays the lady, Noémie Merlant the artist.
                   Parasite                   
And here's the best-reviewed: Bong Joon-ho's black comedy about an impoverished family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy household despite their lack of qualifications. So far, it's made $127m - and it may just prove this year's Oscar upset, unseating The Irishman and            Marriage Story for best picture.

Feb 08, 2020( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  With Oscar ballots filed, we're forging ahead with our third annual series of interviews with Academy voters from different branches for their candid thoughts on what got picked, overlooked, and overvalued this year.Best PictureNine is too many. This was a lackluster year. I struggled to come up with five. We know the Academy is all about the actors, the largest group of people who dominate and decide everything!
 #8216;Parasite[1].#8217; It's an invigorating movie to watch. Bong Joon Ho took me places I didn't think I was going to go. The performances are great. The story it told at this moment in time of the haves and have-nots was fascinating. The humor, we need humor! In all this grimness. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217; has humor within the story. Even #8216;The Irishman#8217; has moments of humor; it helps to leaven the grimness. I liked #8216;Parasite#8217; the best. I'd vote for something else for Best International Feature Film. #8216;The Irishman.#8217; The performances were great; you got inside the head of a murderer, and how he evolved. Marty Scorsese is a deft director — you put yourself in his hands and you have an excellent journey. I did watch it in the theater at 11 a.m. so as not to fall asleep. It was three-and-a-half hours long, but I was gripped. #8216;Little Women[2].#8217; I don't have as much invested as other people I know; it wasn't a book I grew up with and adored. I came to it with a cleaner slate. I wasn't as upset with the feminist changes Greta Gerwig made — I enjoyed it. The performances were entertaining! I had problems with the backwards and forwards construction; I found it confusing and not necessary. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; I loved the #8216;what if?#8217; conceit of the movie; it was brilliant. Quentin Tarantino's gratuitous violence turns me off. I sit there with my hands over my eyes. #8216;Jojo Rabbit.#8217; It was a brilliant conceit, and the performances were great. I couldn't quite get into it; it's tough. Not because Taika Waititi's making fun of Hitler and the history of Nazis — it was a leap I didn't entirely make — but I was watching from a distance, in a way. #8216;Marriage Story.#8217; I like Noah Baumbach's movies generally, but he lost me, because suddenly this guy who runs this podunk theater in New York has enough money to hire a big lawyer and rent an apartment in LA, fly backwards and forwards? That stepped out of reality for me. I didn't believe the characters anymore. It's such a kitchen-sink story. I went with the stuff about why they're splitting up, but the minute it became a divorce saga of expensive lawyers vying with each other, I didn't care, I didn't believe it anymore. It was sad. #8216;1917.#8217; Manohla Dargis said it the best[3]. It was pretentious and lengthy and Richard Brody[4] did a good critique of it; the story is limited and one-note. I was watching this clever trick of doing the supposed one shot throughout the movie, which of course it isn't. I grew a bit bored by it. It was very real — I'm interested in that period and stories of men in that war — but I was disappointed. #8216;Joker.#8217; I was beaten on the head over and over again. I didn't want to be there with these people. #8216;King of Comedy#8217; had gone into that territory and done it better. It was too unpleasant, and I don't know the purpose of it. Maybe it's a reflection of our society, but I see Trump on TV every day and I don't need this.Best DirectorMartin Scorsese. It's a lifetime achievement thing with him. I don't know that #8216;The Irishman#8217; is my favorite movie of his. He's such an excellent director. Bong Joon Ho. That's a dilemma. It's a very close first, if I could vote for two. I can't stand the idea of Quentin Tarantino up there banging on. The ego, the ego!Best ActorThey're all really good actors; that's not the issue. it's whether their moments in the films moved me or I felt galvanized by them. Jonathan Pryce. I voted for #8216;The Two Popes#8217; as one of my favorite movies of the year. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It was a smart movie. I'd give it to Pryce, with Antonio a close second. Antonio Banderas. I didn't love that movie as much as other Pedro Almodóvar movies. Adam Driver. I am in love with him, but how much I didn't like the movie supersedes the performance. I can't disassociate.Best ActressI'm not thrilled by any of them. I don't know who I would have put in instead . Saoirse Ronan is really good; I liked #8216;Little Women#8217; more than the other films. Rene Zellweger. I didn't love #8216;Judy.#8217; It's a shame she sang. Bob Ackerman's #8216;Judy#8217; was fine with Judy Davis. Cynthia Erivo.I didn't love #8216;Harriet.#8217; Charlize Theron. At the end of #8216;Bombshell#8217; I didn't know who these women were and what really motivated them.Best Supporting ActorTom Hanks (#8216;A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood#8217;). I was nervous about seeing him do that. He walked a fine line between imitating someone, which gets old, and doing an interpretation, particularly with such a recognizable voice and cadence. It could get annoying. So I give him props for that. Brad Pitt (#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood#8217;). I might have to vote for him for sheer lust.Pitt gave a nuanced performance, as he did in #8216;Thelma and Louise.#8217; He has the chops. But his looks are distracting and take away from his ability to perform. You get seduced and distracted by that. Anthony Hopkins (#8216;The Two Popes#8217;). What was so clever was their foreign accents, which were enough to understand that they came from someplace else and where, but it wasn't overwhelming. Anthony gave a refined low-key performance that was nice to see. Al Pacino and Joe Pesci (#8216;The Irishman#8217;). With Al, the hair was distracting. When you are looking at a big screen it takes up a lot of space. He's better than he has been in a while, not chewing up the scenery as much as he can. I'm glad they were in the movie; they augmented it. I didn't feel so moved by their performances; I appreciated them.Supporting ActressScarlett Johansson (#8216;Jojo Rabbit#8217;). She had quite a range in that role, from being charming, to being caught in a bad situation and trying to deal with this impossible world, which was not exactly surprising from her but unexpected. She had an accent, she was real, this person existed in this fantasy world the director had created. That's important: she had that base that you can hang onto as you go for the ride. Kathy Bates (#8216;Richard Jewell#8217;). Her performance is pretty amazing, and moving. I really cared about this woman. She captured that maternal angst [and] I can identify with, God forbid, being powerless to do anything about [what's happening to your child]. Margot Robbie (#8216;Bombshell#8217;). She was so good in #8216;I, Tonya.#8217; I can't fault her, again. That moment in the office with John Lithgow is extraordinary. You viscerally feel what she's going through, what she's on the verge of capitulating to. Laura Dern (#8216;Marriage Story#8217;). My dislike of the movie overrides her performance for me. Florence Pugh (#8216;Little Women#8217;). I wasn't knocked out.Adapted ScreenplayAnthony McCarten (#8216;The Two Popes#8217;). This excellent story well told was given short shrift. It's a complicated story he was telling, with the trick of how you portray people who are still alive. He did it really powerfully. The flashbacks integrated into the movie were well done.Original Screenplay#8216;Parasite.#8217; It's so original, clever, and brilliant.Costume Design#8216;Jojo Rabbit.#8217; It's historically accurate; there's a twist on the costumes, they are reflections of the story, which is a fantasy in some ways. The costumes are a little extreme, not what everyday people in Germany would be wearing. They have a toe in reality, so they're not totally outrageous. The designer took it that extra step, which melded with the tone of the movie. I hope that one wins. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Arianne Phillips did a great job with the costumes. They are very textured, with lots of variety — there's hippies, and the more stylish, sophisticated looks for Sharon Tate. It wasn't too kitschy. Sometimes period stuff can get too obvious. There was a range she covered, pretty accurately, with subtlety. The clothes looked worn, they were a bit funky, crumpled. They weren't pulled freshly out of dry-cleaning bags, but reflected the way Brad Pitt lived in that trailer. Things were not spick and span. There was a variety of looks appropriate for each character, like Leonardo's leisure suit. Things repeated a bit, again how people really wear their clothing. It's not a new outfit every time; people have a uniform they wear. #8216;Little Women.#8217; I went with the costumes. Greta was giving us a rose-tinted view of the world they lived in, which is true of a lot of period films. The hair and makeup can make or break it; if you go over the top, it takes away from the costumes, it distracts you. That's not good. Laura Dern would never have hair like that. These people bathed once a month, plus all that food on the table! They were living in the land of plenty. The hair did them in. If the hair been more realistic it would have dialed down everything. #8216;Knives Out.#8217; Contemporary films often get short shrift. I was pleased it also got the CDG [Costume Designers Guild] prize. It was witty, and the costumes reflected the tone of the movie: that's what a good costume should do, as well as interpret the character. #8216;The Irishman.#8217; Sandy Powell, she's great. But how many Oscars[5] does she need? Spread it around a little. If I don't like the movie, it's hard for me to separate the movie from the costumes. #8216;Joker.#8217; Joaquin Phoenix was terrific, but the movie left me cold. So, I'm less enthusiastic about the costumes. Also, Mark Bridges has won a couple of Oscars.International Feature Film#8216;Honeyland#8217; (Macedonia). It's a gripping documentary about the extraordinary world of this woman, her life, and these people invading, how they take over and almost destroy her, and how she survives. It's a mirror, again, of what's going on in the world. Everything is different in this very remote place, but no, it's filled with humans who behave badly, just like everywhere. And it's touching because she tried to be a good Samaritan and the kids do nothing but abuse her. What's clever about it: you also feel for the family, they're trying to survive, they're being stupid about it, they're mistaken about what they're doing, which leads to disaster. They could have gotten on together and been all right, but the guy gets too greedy. And it all falls apart. It's an extraordinary movie. #8216;Parasite#8217; (South Korea). If you're going to compete in Best Picture you shouldn't be in Best International Film Feature; that takes an opportunity away from someone else. It's double-dipping. What about all those poor foreign movies? #8216;Parasite#8217; got an insane amount of publicity — how do you compete with that? To be in too many categories is not fair. If the Academy Awards do in fact mean something and can help a movie make money, let's give that opportunity to as many people as we can.Documentary Feature#8216;For Sama.#8217; I went to a small screening. [Waad Al-Kateab] was there with the guy [Edward Watts] who helped put it together. I was weeping. For the sheer emotional experience you can't beat #8216;For Sama.#8217; It takes us out into this world we can't even imagine. That they stayed [in Aleppo] trying to do good, while they jeopardized their lives and their daughter, is a kind of bravery beyond my comprehension. It's an important story to get out: what goes on in these countries we're toying with, not giving aid to, or [where we're] backing the wrong person. #8216;American Factory#8217; is incredible, an excellent documentary that also tells the story of something really important.Cinematography#8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217;Robert Richardson has won a ton but he's a great cinematographer. #8216;1917#8217; looked gorgeous but I didn't like the movie. #8216;The Lighthouse.#8217; I hated the movie, it could have taken an hour or so, but went on and on in such bleakness. It was visually extraordinary. With a movie like that, I often think, #8216;the poor cast and crew, such a miserable shoot!#8217; #8216;The Irishman#8217; had a good look, but that weird CGI stuff making actors look younger was distracting, which was not [Rodrigo Prieto]'s fault.EditingIt was between #8216;Parasite#8217; and #8216;The Irishman.#8217; Thelma Schoonmaker deserves it for dealing with Marty. If she had never won I'd vote for her [she has won three times]. #8216;Ford v Ferrari.#8217; The race sequences were confusing. I couldn't tell which car was the car I was meant to be watching.Makeup and Hairstyling#8216;1917#8217; has excellent wounds and horrible things: the distress of the human body going through war. #8216;Judy#8217; was not a standout for what they did to Rene. That's what's good about it; you're not distracted by it which would have been bad. #8216;Bombshell.#8217; They did such an amazing job of making Charlize Theron look like Megyn Kelly that it's almost creepy.Production Design#8216;Parasite#8217; was fantastic, that world he created, between the horrible apartment and the fancy house, and then the surprise dungeon. #8216;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.#8217; Barbara Ling's period stuff was more spectacular. She recreated things that don't exist anymore, taking familiar landmarks and seeing them through period eyes. #8216;1917.#8217; The production design of Dennis Gassner was amazing. #8216;The Irishman#8217; had a nitty gritty, grim very real look to it; the color palette was dowdy and sad.

SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of - South Koreans are reveling in writer-director Bong Joon Ho's dark comic thriller, "Parasite," which won this year's Academy Awards for best film and best international feature. The movie itself, however, doesn't put the country in a particularly positive light.
No doubt, the international acclaim for "Parasite," which also won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, highlights South Korea's emergence as a global cultural power, a reflection of decades of focus on building world-class industries in one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia.
But it also hints at an uncomfortable truth: While the national successes have been spectacular - from Samsung's rise as a global economic powerhouse to the explosion of K-pop in Asia and beyond - many South Koreans recognize that there's been a dark side to that rise. Only a few years ago, Bong himself was blacklisted by the government, and the characters in his film reflect a society where many feel intense hopelessness.
South Korea's rapid emergence from the devastation of the 1950-53 Korean War also saw a bloody transition from dictatorship to democracy. Its association with neat smartphones and cars came amid a constant threat from nuclear North Korea. For every international success, there's also widespread worry that South Korea will forever be overshadowed by regional giants Russia, China and Japan.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who frequently praises mega-popular K-pop boy band BTS, tweeted that he's grateful to Bong for "giving courage and pride to our people overcoming difficulties."
But "Parasite"'s main characters portray South Koreans who have been left behind by the country's dramatic changes. It's a biting commentary on deepening inequality and other problems that have many young and poor people describing their lives as a hellish nightmare.
South Korea has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor among developed nations and is struggling mightily to deal with decaying job markets, rocketing house prices and a record-low birth rate as couples put off having babies while struggling with low pay and harsh work conditions.
Although fully Korean in language, humour and tone, Bong's dark tale of poverty and class struggle resonates across borders because Western democracies are also experiencing similar social and economic problems, albeit not as "extreme" as in South Korea, according to Chin Jung-kwon, a prominent cultural critic.
"The film shows that South Korea still has a strong message to show the world," Chin said.
While Bong is uniquely talented as a director, it was only a matter of time before South Korean movies and other pop cultural products gained increasing acceptance in the West, considering South Korea's dynamic cultural scene, which has matured along with its democracy, Chin says.
K-pop has garnered a huge international following with an increasing number of fans coming from the United States.
With "Map of the Soul: Persona," BTS last year became the first musicians since the Beatles to debut three consecutive albums atop the Billboard Album chart in a span of less than a year. South Korean TV dramas, which triggered the original "Korean Wave" in the early 2000s, continue to be big in Asia and other regions like the Middle East.
Perhaps more than any other genre, South Korean films have aggressively tested artistic boundaries, often with stunning visuals and violence meant to expose the underside of the country's economic success story.
This sometimes creates political consequences for the artists.
Bong was one of thousands of artists who were blacklisted and denied government funds under the rule of conservative former President Park Geun-hye for their allegedly critical views of her administration. Following protests by millions, Park was ousted from office in March 2017 and is now serving a decades-long prison term for corruption.
Not everyone was happy about how Bong portrayed the characters in "Parasite," which tells the story of how an unemployed family of four living in a slum basement apartment comically con their way into the lives one of Seoul's wealthiest families before things begin to unravel darkly.
Critic Kim Gyu-hang accused Bong of objectifying poor people and treating their lives like a "sightseeing attraction," saying that the film makes no real attempt at explaining how the system locked the characters in a desperately hopeless situation.
"("Parasite") provides no deep insight into humans, their anger and how they are a byproduct of the social system that surrounds them," Kim said.
"Parasite"'s Oscars success follows years of struggles by South Korean directors to break through in Hollywood. Park Chan-wook, who won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival with his thriller "Oldboy," received mixed reviews for his 2013 work "Stoker," an English-language thriller starring Nicole Kidman. Bong enjoyed both commercial and critical success with his 2013 sci-fi film "Snowpiercer," which starred Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton along with "Parasite" actor Song Kang-ho.
But nothing that's come before has been remotely as successful as this South Korean film shot in the Korean language.
"Every society in the world experiences conflicts created by people's efforts to move up the class ladder, and South Korean films have dealt with this issue for a long time," said veteran filmmaker Lee Jang-ho. "Maybe Bong's dark humour and his vivid description of the lives of the South Korean poor, including their 'half-basement' living spaces, felt refreshing to American moviegoers."

Oscar-nominated film review: 'Parasite' deserves all awards for genre-bending tale of class differences
Oklahoma Daily: University of Oklahoma Norman Campus

Editor's note: This article is the 4th of seven film reviews that are The Daily staff's top picks from the 92nd Academy Awards nominees. The final results will be announced at the annual ceremony, streaming at 7 p.m. Feb. 9 on ABC Network. 
"Parasite" is a nearly perfect movie which deserves every award it is a contender for, however it does notneed any awards to prove itself. 
The film has already made history by being the first South Korean film to be nominated for the Oscars "best picture" category. "Parasite," directed by Bong Joon-ho, was also nominated for five other Academy Awards: "best director,""best film editing," "best foreign language film," "best original screenplay" and "best production design."
It's so metaphorical.Thank you @TheAcademy #OscarNoms #ParasiteMovie pic.twitter.com/hG67pdZZ2Y - Parasite (@ParasiteMovie) January 13, 2020
Prior to its Oscar nominations, the film performed well with critics during its festival circuit - even winning the coveted Palme d'Or at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. 
Most recently, on Jan. 5, the film took home the Screen Actors Guild award for "outstanding performance by a cast," beating out top contenders and big names such as Robert De Niro and "The Irishman" ensemble, and Quentin Tarantino's star-studded cast for "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."
The film is deserving of every award it has earned. It is one of the most pleasurable movie-going experiences of 2019. 
Part-heist, part-horror, part-comedy, part-drama, "Parasite" defies genre to deliver a fluid experience of laughter, tears and moments of "Oh god, what's happening?" 
The plot follows a lower class family, struggling to make ends meet, who become the caretakers of a rich family in one of South Korea's wealthiest neighborhoods.
That is as much plot detail a viewer can learn before venturing into spoiler territory. 
The film is best experienced with little-to-no knowledge of its plot, as it is full of fun and shocking moments, all cleverly interlaced in one of the most compelling plots put on screen.  
American audiences would most recognize director Bong's work from "Snowpiercer" (Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton) and Netflix's "Okja" (Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal), though he has more Korean-language films under his belt, "Parasite" among them.
While the cast is made up of entirely Korean actors, they rightfully deserve their SAG award and should have been nominated for the Academy Awards as well. Despite the difference in language, every character in "Parasite" is phenomenal because of the actors portraying them.
Song Kang-ho, who plays the father of the poor family in the film, has been a frequent star in Bong's previous works and gives an incredibly subdued performance, perfectly suited for where the plot takes his character. The children in the main family, portrayed by Choi Woo-sik and Park So-dam, give such believable performances that the audience might forget they aren't really siblings. This review could detail every performance and praise each individual, but it would be more beneficial to just watch the film.
American audiences are notoriously bad at seeing foreign films in theaters compared to the rest of the world. There are a variety of reasons for the lack of engagement. Subtitles are a large turn-off for movie goers who think its too much of a burden to read an English translation, but Bong has been campaigning for Americans to watch more foreign language films.
 "Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films,"  Bong said in his Golden Globes acceptance speech.
While the Academy Awards are frequently seen by American audiences as the pinnacle of film awards, to foreign filmmakers it's just another awards show. Other awards, like the Palme d'Or at Cannes, are much more coveted. In an interview with Vulture, Bong even called the event "local" in terms of relevance.
While the Oscars may not hold much international importance, the awards give notoriety to films and filmmakers, especially with American audiences, that may not otherwise receive it.
"Parasite" is a great place for American audiences to start overcoming their phobia of subtitles, because by the first 15 minutes of the film there will be less focus on "Why am I reading?" and more focus on "What happens next?"
Film enthusiasts should make it their top priority to see "Parasite" - best experienced in a theater - as soon as possible. OU's Meacham Auditorium will have 6 p.m., 9 p.m. and midnight showings of the film on Friday, March 6.  
The Academy Awards air at 7 p.m. on Sunday, Feb. 9 on ABC network. The awards show will be full of American stars and filmmakers but if previous awards are anything to go by, "Parasite" is all set up to make a big splash among its American contenders, and rightfully so. 
The Daily staff's full list of reviews from the 92nd Academy Awards nominations:
•	"1917"
•	"The Irishman"
•	"Little Women"

Bong Joon-ho's film "Parasite" starts in a dingy, half-basement apartment with a family of four barely able to scratch out a life. There must be no place to go but up, right? Yes and no. There's nothing predictable when the South Korean director is on his game.
This dark, socially conscious film about the intertwining of two families is an intricately plotted, adult thriller. We can go up, for sure, but Bong can also take us deeper down. There's always an extra floor somewhere in this masterpiece.
It tells the story of the impoverished four-person Kim family who, one by one, and with careful and devious planning, all get employed by the four-person affluent Park family - as a tutor, an art teacher, a driver and a housekeeper. They are imposters stunned by the way wealth can make things easier: "Money is an iron. It smooths out all the creases," says the Park patriarch with wonder.
Bong, who directed and wrote the story for "Parasite," has picked his title carefully, of course. Naturally, he's alluding to the sycophantic relationship by a clan of scammers to the clueless rich who have unwittingly opened the doors of their home on a hill. But it's not that simple. The rich family seem incapable of doing anything - from dishes to sex - without help. Who's scamming who?
Bong's previous films play with film genres and never hide their social commentary - think of the environmentalist pig-caper "Okja" and the dystopian sci-fi global warming scream "Snowpiercer." But this time, Bong's canvas is a thousand times smaller and his focus light-years more intense. There are no CGI train chases on mountains or car chases through cities. (There is also, thankfully, 100% less Tilda Swinton, a frequent, over-the-top Bong collaborator.)
The two Korean families first make contact when a friend of the Kim's son asks him to take over English lessons for the Park daughter. Soon the son (a dreamy Choi Woo-sik) convinces them to hire his sister (the excellent Park So-dam) as an art teacher, but doesn't reveal it's his sis. She forges her diploma and spews arty nonsense she learned on the internet, impressing the polite but firm Park matriarch (a superb Jo Yeo-jeong.)
The Park's regular chauffer is soon let go and replaced by the Kim patriarch (a steely Lee Sun-kyun). Ditto the housemaid, who is dumped in favour of the Kims' mother (a feisty Jang Hye-jin.) All eight people seem happy with the new arrangement until Bong reveals a twist: There are more parasites than you imagined. The clean, impeccably furnished Park home will have some blood splashing about.
Bong's trademark slapstick is still here but the rough edges of his often too-loud lessons are shaved down nicely and his actors step forward. "Keep it focused," the Kim's son counsels his father at one point. Bong has followed that advice.
There are typically dazzling Bong touches throughout. Just look for all the insect references - stink bugs at the beginning to flies at the end, and a preoccupation with odor across the frames. And there's a scene in which the rich matriarch skillfully winds noodles in a bowl while, in another room, duct tape is being wrapped around a victim and classical music plays.
Bong could have been more strident in his social critique but hasn't. There are no villains in "Parasite" - and also no heroes. Both families are forever broken after chafing against each other, a bleak message about the classes ever really co-existing (Take that, "Downton Abbey").
"Parasite" is a worthy winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first South Korean movie to win the prestigious top prize. The director has called it an "unstoppably fierce tragicomedy." We just call it brilliant.
"Parasite," a Neon release, is rated R for "language, some violence and sexual content." Running time: 136 minutes. Four stars out of four.

Beyond Fest Review: 'Parasite' - Peachy Con

Sep 27, 2019( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival[1]. By the time regular audiences get to see it, that might be more hype[2] than it can bear. Add to that wins at the Sydney Film Festival and Fantastic Fest and Parasite is setting up a tough act to deliver. Fortunately, Parasite is up to the challenge. 
It's a great movie worthy of those accolades. A family of parasites The Kim family is eeking out a living any way they can. They steal wi-fi in the corners of their home and try to make money folding pizza boxes. This isn't enough so they enact an elaborate plan to install each family member with the Park family. L-R: Choi Woo-Shik, Song Kang-ho, Chang Hyae-jin and Park So-dam in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment First, siblings Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) and Kim Ki-jung (Park So-dam) sell the Parks on tutoring and art therapy for their kids, Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun) and Da-hye (Jung Ji-So). Then they sabotage the housekeeper (Lee Jeong-eun) to get their mother Kim Khung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) installed as her replacement. She then sabotages the Park family chauffeur to get her husband Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) hired as his replacement.So the whole Kim family is living it up in the Park house, until they discover a secret that threatens both their livelihood and the Park family. The con is on The Kim family cons are very entertaining. You wouldn't want to be on the receiving end, and Mr. and Mrs. Park (Lee Sun-kyun and Yeo-jeong Jo) didn't do anything to deserve it, except maybe being well off when others have nothing. The audience gets to watch the Kims script and rehearse their lines until they perfect the con. Lee Sun-kyun and Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment The cons escalate. They're a source of fun and humor, but also danger. Manipulating food allergies is elaborate, but seems little more than deadly than an inconvenience to the victim. Although it also costs her her livelihood, it's not life-threatening.Director Bong Joon-ho[3] ratchets up the tension while maintaining a playful sense of fun. Beyond a certain point in the con I won't spoil where it goes, but everything Bong sets up early in the film pays off in surprising and satisfying ways. The cast sells 'Parasite' Bong and his co-writer Han Jin Won may be the masterminds but Parasite wouldn't work without the charismatic leads enacting their plan. The Kim family actors have a delicate balance to strike. They are manipulators, schemers, thieves and we have to like them. Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment A lot falls on the Park family actors too. Jo is the most reactive to all the cons. She's a germophobe so suspecting the housekeeper is sick sends her into a tizzy. She's also overly protective of her kids so her reactions to all their studies are fraught. She is delicious as we revel in her freaking out but sympathize that we know how badly the Kims are manipulating this poor woman. Who is the real 'Parasite'? So the title Parasite raises interesting connotations. It would be easy to say the Kims are parasites. They're living off the resources of the wealthy. I don't know what the financial climate of Korea is but if it's anything like the U.S. it wouldn't be a stretch to call the Parks parasites. They don't seem to be extremely wealthy but they may have accumulated their comfortable lifestyle by using up people beneath them. Or maybe the Kims are misguided in their targets. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-sik in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment There are more parasites coming between the Kims and the Parks but I won't spoil it. What the ambiguous classification of parasites and the amount of potential parasites suggest is that everybody is using somebody to get ahead. Maybe that's a societal problem that should be examined. There's got to be a way for everybody to mutually benefit from working together.Knowing writer/director Bong Joon-ho's work, it's no spoiler to imply that Parasite turns violent. That's inherent to the con artist genre too. Tricking people often has violent results. That's also the nature of parasitic relationships. Eventually someone is used up. Either the host is bled dry, or the parasite gets removed. So don't be a parasite, but they sure are fun to watch.

AUDIE CORNISH:                 No foreign-language film has ever opened at the numbers of a new satirical comedy that opened this past weekend. A Korean film called "Parasite" opened to record audiences in New York and LA and expands to other cities Friday. Critic Bob Mondello says no matter what audiences expect, they're likely to be surprised.             
BOB MONDELLO:                 A tale of two families, the Parks, who live in a designer house atop a hill...             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                
BOB MONDELLO:                 ...And the Kims, who live in a grungy basement apartment across town.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                
BOB MONDELLO:                 Literally high and low, both physically and in social status, they wouldn't normally meet. But then a friend drops by the Kims' basement with a gift, a big stone that his grandfather claims will bring the family material wealth. This is so metaphorical, says 20-something Kim Ki-woo.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "PARASITE")                
CHOI WOO-SHIK:                 (As Kim Ki-woo, speaking Korean).             
BOB MONDELLO:                 His mom is skeptical.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "PARASITE")                
JANG HYE-JIN:                 (As Kim Chung-sook, speaking Korean).             
BOB MONDELLO:                 Food would have been better, she says. Still, the friend also brings word that the wealthy Park family needs an English tutor for their daughter, and he sets up Ki-woo with an audition for the job.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                
BOB MONDELLO:                 Mrs. Park tells him she always sits in on the first lesson.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "PARASITE")                
CHO YEO-JEONG:                 (As Park Yeon-kyo) If it's OK with you.             
BOB MONDELLO:                 Ki-woo gets the tutoring job, then starts building on what is a really good deal. The Parks pay well, so he introduces his sister - he says she's a friend of a classmate - as an art therapist for their son. Beats folding pizza boxes to earn money or leaving the window open in the Kim apartment when the city fumigates the alley it's on to get free exterminating.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                
BOB MONDELLO:                 Money is an iron, says someone. It smooths out the wrinkles - another metaphor, and a clue that the Kim family's scam, which just seems funny at first, is more than it appears. Writer-director Bong Joon-ho never goes for just funny. His sci-fi epic "Snowpiercer," for instance, put the last survivors of a climate disaster on a train and set them to killing each other in a class war. And as the comedy starts curdling in "Parasite," class struggle is again on his mind.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, "PARASITE")                
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR:                 (As character) I'm deadly serious.             
BOB MONDELLO:                 The haves here aren't hateful. They're just insensitive. Mr. Park keeps scrunching up his nose and talking about the stench of poverty. And the have-nots aren't vicious, so much as hapless for a while. And then - well, shouldn't spoil things. Let's just say that by "Parasite's" conclusion, what started out as a comedy of manners has become a furious snarl of rage and his most arresting social satire yet.             
                I'm Bob Mondello.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF JENNY LEWIS SONG, "YOU CAN'T OUTRUN 'EM")

Movie Review: So who's the 'Parasite' here?

Oct 27, 2019( Roger's Movie Nation: http://rogersmovienation.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Korean director who first gained global fame with his wry creature feature 'The Host' reconsiders that host-parasite relationship with his latest, 'Parasite.' Bong Joon Ho has a created a dark satire of haves and enterprising have-nots, a film that begins as a delightful 'Big Con' comedy and probes deeper and turns more politically pointed — and more violent — the further it goes along. Most cleverly, this skewering of global inequality and class warfare, at least as it pertains to his home peninsula, leaves unanswered the big question of an era when wealth has been callously and mercilessly redistributed upward to a rapacious few. 
That question is, 'Who will be first against the wall when the revolution comes?' Bong's muse, the hulking comic Song Kang-ho, plays the unemployed and broke patriarch of a family of four on the bottom rung of Seoul society — literally. They live in a smelly basement apartment where they've lost cell service, and on the evening we meet them, their free source of wi-fi — a neighbor — has just password-protected his router. With his wife,Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) and two enterprising college age kids, Ki-jung (Park So-dam)) and Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), father Ki-taek folds pizza delivery boxes, the lone hustle they have that pays in this economy.And Youtube tutorials or not, they can't even do that right.  How will they cling to this dump, where the toilet sits up on an interior ledge next to the window drunken bums pee on every night? Everybody wonders what Ki-taek's 'plan' is. Dad is big on 'What's your plan?' A windfall that he hasn't planned for is their lifeline, it turns out. Ki-woo's buddy, headed off to study abroad, recommends him as replacement for the rich teen girl he's been tutoring. Sister Ki-jung forges Ki-woo some ace credentials as 'Kevin,' which win over the girl (Jung Ji-so) and her frazzled, pampered mother (Jo Yeo-jeong). And all a 'Parasite' needs, we see, if that first foot in the door. 'Kevin' is quick to recommend 'a friend of a cousin' who studied in Illinois as an art tutor to the ADHD artist child in the house. 'Jessica' is the name Ki-jung goes by. Sizing the kid and his mother's worries up, she improvises 'art therapist' into her resume as well. This scrawled, dark corner in all of little Da-song's drawings? That's 'the schizophrenia zone,' she says, freaking Mom out. That ability to lie on the fly is a family gift, and it's what puts all four of the Kims in the employ of the Parks, by hook or by crook.This 2019 Cannes Palme d'Or winner has fake tutors straight out of Shakespeare ('The Taming of the Shrew'). But I'd be surprised if Bong Joon ho didn't see 2018's Japanese Cannes Film Festival entry 'Shoplifters,' and wasn't inspired to whip up a funnier and more ambitious take on an underworld of low-rent grifters struggling to survive in the Golden Age of Income Inequality. But here, there's sympathy and even a modicum respect for their 'marks.' In an economy where jobs are scarce and survival precarious, the Kims are grateful to have the jobs they finagle (and lie and cheat) their way into. Ki-jung seems to be the most ruthless and cunning one, taking after her pitiless mother. Ki-jung is the one who surmises that the family driver can be unseated, and lets her folks know (in Korean, with English subtitles) 'I set my trap in the Benz,' the family limo, a trap that will get that driver canned. All these amusing machinations are just the table-setting for the confrontations to come. It turns out, the Kims aren't the only ones desperate enough to prey on people like the Parks. And as they hustle them and deal with petty humiliations and bourgeois snobbery, they start to wonder, and make us wonder, just who is the host and who is the real parasite here? Song Kang-ho has an oafish soulfulness that his director has tapped into, in film after film. He can let us feel pity for a character and laugh at him (a little) at the same time. The laughs don't dry up as things take a bloodier turn, but rather devolve into class warfare giggles. We know we should be shrinking from the mayhem, not chuckling. And yet, as in a horror movie where we figure 'They have it coming,' we can't help ourselves. There's something of a Great Leap Forward in Bong Joon Ho's ambitions and skill at realizing them here, something that his failed Netflix satire 'Ojkja' and the over-reaching sci-fi 'Snowpiercer' couldn't manage. With 'Parasite' he transcends genre even as he sharpens his social satire skills, delivering a movie that will resonate from Seoul to Syracuse, Helsinki to Hong Kong, one of the great films of 2019.MPAA Rating: R for language, some violence and sexual content Cast: Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam, Jo Yeo-Jeong, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-sik, Jang Hye-jin, Lee Jeong-eun, JungJi-so Credits: Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho, co-written by Han Jin Won.

An ingenious drama/dark-comedy divulges class discrimination in this gasp-inducing foreign film.
It comes to no surprise that "Parasite" directed by Bong Joon Ho made Oscar history winning four Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Foreign Language Film.
Not only was "Parasite" the first international movie to score Best Picture but it took home the most awards at the Oscars 2020.
Taking place in South Korea, the destitute Kim family struggles for job opportunities.
Son Ki-woo is introduced to a tutoring job from a college friend for the wealthy Park family. The rest of the Kim family swindled their way to occupy the remaining jobs at the wealthy Seoul family home.
A film for the Redbirds, "Parasite" does indeed reference ISU. Sister Ki-jeong pretends to be a recent graduate from the School of Fine Arts at Illinois State University in order to secure a job at the opulent household.
Bong does a great job captivating a greedy and mendacious family that makes you feel for them. Many twists unfold throughout the film unveiling tragedy and reflection.
The stunning cinematography and the bond the Kim family has will make you forget you are reading English subtitles.
Grab some popcorn and your favorite candy because you will be glued to the screen wondering what is going to happen next in this unpredictable film.
You might want to check your basement after watching this dark and brilliant film.

3 Reasons Why 'Parasite' Really Could Win Best Picture - And 1 Reason Why It Can't

Jan 22, 2020( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  When 'Parasite' debuted in Cannes in May, received rave reviews and won the festival's Palme d'Or, it didn't seem crazy to think that Bong Joon Ho's black comedy about class differences could make a splash at the Oscars. But back then, 'making a splash at the Oscars' meant becoming South Korea's first-ever nominee in the Best International Feature Film category (formerly Best Foreign Language Film), and maybe, just maybe, slipping into the Best Picture race as a dark horse, the way 2012 Palme winner 'Amour' did. How small and silly those dreams now seem. 'Parasite' has only picked up steam through the summer and fall, going from a longshot to a lock — and now, eight days before Oscar voting begins and two-and-a-half weeks before the 92nd Academy Awards, it has a real chance to win Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture, along with its guaranteed win in the international category. 
Just last weekend, the film beat 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' and 'The Irishman' to win the SAG ensemble award two days after beating 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'The Irishman' and 'Joker' for the American Cinema Editors' ACE Eddie Award. Given everything that has happened with the film recently, it now feels like the biggest challenger to '1917' for the Best Picture award, with 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' and 'The Irishman' hoping to claw back into the race with a Directors Guild win on Saturday. Also Read: How 'Parasite' Director Bong Joon Ho Created the Year's Most Dangerously Charming Film[1] Here are three reasons why 'Parasite' could win, and one reason why it couldn't.REASONS WHY 'PARASITE' CAN WIN: 1. Because actors love it as long as they don't need to know the difference between Song Kang Ho and Park So Dam.To win the top Oscar, you need the support of the Academy's Actors Branch, which at 1,324 members is by far the largest AMPAS branch. And maybe you could worry about whether the branch loves the film if you simply look at the fact that it didn't receive a single acting nomination from the Academy, or a single individual acting nomination from the Screen Actors Guild. But were the lack of acting nominations really because actors haven't warmed to the movie? Nope. I would suggest it's because most voters have only seen 'Parasite' recently and have no experience with the cast. They simply don't know that it's Song Kang Ho playing the poor family's battered patriarch with enormous dignity and subtlety, or that Park So Dam is perfection as the scheming daughter, or that Cho Yeo Jeong is brilliantly gullible as the rich mother. Should they have figured that out? Of course they should have. But hey, it's a short awards season and Academy screeners can't come with pictures of the cast. And here's the key: In the category where SAG voters didn't need to know individual names, the ensemble category, 'Parasite' not only received a nomination, it won after its actors received a standing ovation for simply walking on stage to introduce a film clip. If actors don't need to get those Korean names straight, they love 'Parasite,' which is full of remarkable acting. Granted, there's a big difference between the 1,200 members of the branch and the 100,000-plus voters in SAG, but it's foolish to think that the film won't have enthusiastic support from the actors in the Academy. Also Read: SAG Awards Crown 'Parasite,' Give the Oscar Race a Shot of Uncertainty[2]2. Because it's the ideal consensus candidate.The day after 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' won the Critics' Choice Award and the day it landed 10 Oscar nominations, a story appeared online attempting to link Quentin Tarantino and Brad Pitt to Harvey Weinstein. The day after '1917' won the Producers Guild Award, a trade publication posted a column entitled 'Why '1917' Is the Last Film That Should Be Winning the Oscar.' And the day after 'Parasite' won the SAG ensemble award well, pretty much everybody talked about how cool it was that 'Parasite' won the SAG ensemble award. 'Parasite' is a movie in search of a takedown campaign — and while the ''Parasite' isn't all that good' take may arrive sooner or later to confirm that it's a true contender, a negative whisper campaign isn't likely to get much traction. It's a movie that almost everybody likes, that almost nobody is sorry to see succeed. And far more than divisive movies like 'Joker' or 'Jojo Rabbit,' it's a movie that may well end up ranked in the Top 5 even on ballots where it's not No. 1. The ranked-choice voting system used by the Academy in the Best Picture category is designed to ferret out a true consensus choice. And 'Parasite' could be that choice. Also Read: '1917' Named Top Film at Producers Guild Awards[3]3. Because the Academy is getting more and more international each year.Last June, 842 people were invited to join the Academy. Of those, around 300 were from outside the United States, including film professionals from 59 different countries. AMPAS is growing at a remarkable rate, with more than 25% of its 8,469 voting members joining in the last four years — and along with a drive to bring in more women and people of color, the membership drive has focused on reaching outside the United States. That's not to say that non-American voters automatically cast their ballots for non-American films — but as the international contingent has grown, so has the number of nominations for international films. These are voters who can say, as Best Director winner Alfonso Cuarón did last year, 'I grew up watching foreign language films' like 'Citizen Kane,' 'Jaws' and 'The Godfather.' And these are voters who now have a real chance to champion international cinema in an unprecedented way. Also Read: Oscars Academy Set to Surpass Gender and Diversity Membership Goals by Next Year[4] Bong Joon Ho wins the Palme d'Or at Cannes in May REASON WHY 'PARASITE' CAN'T WIN: 1. Because it's a guaranteed winner in what is essentially another 'Best Picture' category.The biggest reason a film not in English will have trouble winning Best Picture isn't that the Academy is averse to non-English films — it's that they already have a place to reward those films. In the same way that the existence of the Best Animated Feature category and the Best Documentary Feature category help explain why those films rarely (in the case of animation) and never (in the case of docs) show up in the Best Picture race, Best International Feature Film is an irresistible escape hatch for many voters. They might love 'Parasite' — maybe even enough to vote for Bong for Best Director — but they can express that love in the international category and have a vote left over for Best Picture. Last year, that thinking no doubt hurt Cuarón's 'Roma,' the non-English film with the best chance to win that award. And this year, it will unquestionably hurt 'Parasite' — quite possibly enough to keep it off the stage at the end of the night. (Maybe 'Parasite' should launch a new ad campaign aimed at Oscar voters: 'You know we're the real Best Picture, so vote for something else in the international category!') I don't know if the three reasons 'Parasite' can win will outweigh the one reason it can't. But I know that in a crazy year, it has a real chance.

How Parasite wormed its way into our hearts; FILM PARASITE South Korean director Bong Joon Ho's social satire is already a critical and commercial hit. Can it clean up at the Oscars?

Bong Joon Ho has spent the past nine months touring the world with his acclaimed new film, and in rare moments of respite has been trying to figure out why. The plot of his brilliant satirical thriller Parasite might resemble a bucket of angry snakes - but it's no twistier than the story of the film itself, which won the Palme d'Or at Cannes before becoming a £120million global box office smash, and is now a two-time Bafta winner and six-time Oscar nominee.
Films that tickle all three of these groups - Cannes juries, mainstream audiences and Oscar voters - are almost unheard of: the last to do so was Pulp Fiction, 25 years ago. That film's director, Quentin Tarantino, was notably beaten by Bong at the Baftas last Sunday evening in the Best Original Screenplay category: a rare and deserved win for a non-English script.
"Sometimes I wonder if Parasite's success is down to the way the film smells," he deadpans in his native Korean, laughing as his regular interpreter, Sharon Choi, unflappably relays the thought. (Choi, a 25-year-old Korean-American, has become the breakout star of the Parasite tour for her seemingly effortless live translation on stage and television.) "Its substance smells pungent and cruel. But in terms of style, it is sweet and enticing.
Perhaps this is a very unusual and appealing bouquet."
It's the morning after the Baftas, in the drawing room of Bong's London hotel: a pot of tea (English) is brewing, and modest elevenses have been served. Dressed in a charcoal suit and cardigan, his hair a half-coiffed nest, he's supremely affable, and looks at least a decade younger than his 50 years. The subdued nature of last night's celebrations may be a factor. Once the ceremony was over, he and the Parasite deputation merely shared a quiet drink, and steeled themselves for Oscar week itself.
"This is the last hundred metres of a long marathon for the whole team," he says. "And I think the Baftas have given us the adrenalin to finish." The biggest surprise of the night, he continues, was how solid the trophies turned out to be. "A heavy golden mask and an even heavier square stone base," he explains, before solemnly adding: "As weighty as the honour itself." There is another quiet chuckle as Choi relays this.
Released in the UK this weekend, Parasite is the breakthrough seasoned Bong-watchers have been anticipating for more than a decade, since his metaphorically charged monster movie The Host became an international cult hit. His seventh feature is a tale of two families: the down-at-heel but wily Kims and the affluent but gullible Parks, who live initially very different existences on opposite sides of modern-day Seoul.
Posing as domestic help, the Kims inveigle their way one by one into the Parks' modernist dream home and horn in on their elegant lifestyle - though once entrenched, a series of unexpected crises throws the ploy into disarray. Many critics, including this one, have found the film hard to categorise.
The first half, in which the Kims execute their plan, is like a particularly fiendish heist movie - while the second, in which all kinds of worst-case-scenarios uproariously click into place, is a kind of Rubik's cube farce. And the whole enterprise is struck through with a rich seam of social commentary: the plot turns on the grim divisions, and even grimmer pacts, between rich and poor, which only serve to keep us all in our place.
The film's tonal chicanery harks back to Hitchcock, but it has also proven to be an asset in the very modern world of social media, where shots and clips of Parasite's more offbeat moments quickly became enshrined as memes.
These were shared far and wide by admirers who proudly assembled under the hashtag #Bonghive - a play on Beyhive, Beyoncé's online fandom, who have been known to swarm on unbelievers.
Bong and his cast have often found themselves wondering why this particular film - so specifically anchored in modern Korean culture, with its wry asides about propaganda piped in from the north and bougie local food trends - was striking such a chord worldwide. But it became clear that it was doing so last autumn, after its North American premieres at the Telluride, Toronto and New York film festivals, when, says Bong, "people around me kept telling me the film would be included in Oscar season, whether I liked it or not."
Perhaps it's partly because Korea is uniquely well-equipped to tell a story about division. The country itself has been riven for more than 70 years, after post-Second World War negotiations between the US-occupied south and Soviet-occupied north reached a stalemate.
The suave Park family patriarch, played by Lee Sun-kyun, often talks about not crossing lines: "And while he's referring to the lines between classes and generations, every Korean person also lives with the line of the 38th parallel in the back of their mind." Bong was born in the city of Daegu in 1969 and raised in Seoul under the dictatorial Fourth Republic. His father was a professor in graphic design, his mother the daughter of the respected novelist Park Tae-won, who scandalously defected to the North in 1950.
As a student, Bong was a member of the country's prodemocracy movement: he also tutored the son of a very rich family friend, an experience that planted the seeds for Parasite in his mind. He discovered cinema through the US armed forces' television channel, his eye caught by the obvious censors' cuts and his imagination fired by thoughts of what they might conceal.
Now long-settled with his wife of 24 years, Sun-young - the couple have a son, Hyo-min, and a pet Norwich terrier, Zzuni - he politely rejects the idea that Parasite is an angry-young-manstyle "message movie". "I don't have the ability to use a film to reflect a specific political agenda," he says - though stresses its timely resonance is fully meant.
"Of the many divisions that exist within this film, the most horrific and cruel and blackly comic is the one between the various poor characters," he says. "Because unfortunately, they don't help each other. They can't form the sense of solidarity. And while that causes a lot of pain and sadness for the audience, I also think that's the most honest portrayal of what's going on in the world right now."
B ong's rise coincided with the explosion in the early 2000s of a gutsy, stylish new Korean cinema, heralded in the UK by the 2004 release of Park Chan-wook's taboo-smashing Oldboy. He gives a very earnest-sounding account of the movement's genesis, which Choi goes on to translate as the Korean government spiking the water supply in the late Nineties with an experimental chemical. Chortling, he then says it was actually the result of a sudden relaxation in censorship, "the fall of social repression we'd been living with until then".
Nevertheless, his work landed him on a "leaked" government blacklist of politically dangerous figures in the art world, to be denied state subsidies and possibly surveilled. His 2003 serial killer procedural Memories of Murder was flagged for its portrayal of "government officials and police as corrupt and/or incompetent groups, instilling negative perceptions in the public", while 2013's Snowpiercer, a muscular INVISION/AP HOLDEN/ science-fiction allegory set on board a post-apocalyptic express train, was decried for "[repudiating] the market economy and [encouraging] campaigns of social resistance".
VON MARK Bong roars with laughter. "It was so f------ stupid," he says, momentarily dropping into English, and recalls a discussion with Park Chan-wook, who was likewise named and shamed. "There were so many filmmakers on that list. We were like, 'Are there that many directors in Korea?' And everyone who wasn't included felt kind of insulted. 'This is a misunderstanding! I have to be on that list!' It was like something from a black comedy."
Of course, it was also borderline dystopian, and after the impeachment of Korean president2017, her former was found guilty sentenced to two Bong, meanwhile, two more projects Seoul-set disaster elements of action London-based by what he describes as "a British story from 2016".

Film: The Parasite
Cast: Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Chang Hyae-jin, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Lee Jung-eun
Director: Bong Joon-ho
Rating: ****
This brilliant character-driven film from acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho brims with humour and insights into the wretched human condition, while it follows a family of scamsters which preys on the wealthy. The Kim family comprising dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang), daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) live hand to mouth in their basement home in a slum.
Using false pretences, Ki-woo begins to tutor small Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso), the pubescent daughter of wealthy Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), and his naive wife Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong). Soon enough, Ki-jung gets hired as an art therapist for the Park's youngest son, Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun).
A couple of cunningly-plotted schemes result in the Park's chauffeur and loyal housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) who harbours a secret, replaced by Ki-taek and Chung-sook. Just as this family of cons gets comfortable (and complacent) there is a radical shift in their fortunes.
Bong's film illuminates the lack of fellowship and empathy on both sides of the class divide. His sympathy and compassion for the poor is palpable but he is very clear about their flaws. The poor are not innocent, if anything, they are wolves in sheep's clothing, having absolutely no compunctions in ripping off their rich selfish employers. Collaborating on the thoughtful script with Jin-won, director Bong casts a non-judgemental spotlight on an existential battle between the poverty stricken and the callous wealthy.
The Parasite's Palme d'Or at Cannes for Best Picture is well deserved and yes, it ought to win at the Golden Globes and the Oscars as well.

Oscar-winning South Korean movie Parasite, which created history by winning four Academy Awards this year, will start streaming on Amazon Prime Video from March 27. The movie will also be available in Hindi.
Helmed and written by Bong Joon Ho, Parasite deals with class divide and how one underprivileged family cons and somewhat manages to climb up the social ladder before things fall apart. It features Park So-dam, Choi Woo-shik and Kang-Ho Song among others.
Apart from the Hindi dubbing, Parasite will also be available on Amazon Prime Video with English subtitles.
In her review of Parasite, The Indian Express film critic Shalini Langer wrote, "Bong Joon-Ho, who has also co-written the story, has several surprises and twists up his sleeve. And many metaphors. About parasite, host. Upstairs, downstairs. Loyalty, love. Virtue, vice. Gutter, smell. Casual affluence, deliberate offence. Rain/sun for some, floods/heat for the other. And about the wool we pull over our eyes as we turn the other way, telling ourselves some lies to help us do that."
She added, "Ho strips that wool off, thread by thread. Right down to the only truth there is - not education, not degree, not work, but money."

Cannes Film Review: 'Parasite'
Variety

A laugh turns into a snarl which gets stuck in the throat like a sob - or an arrow through the neck - in Bong Joon-ho's latest wild, wild ride, "           Parasite." On paper, that might not sound so very different from the experience of watching Bong's "Snowpiercer," "Memories of Murder" "The Host" or "Okja." The Korean trickster god is above all known for his uncategorizable movie melées which tumble bloodily down the genre stairs hitting every step - comedy, horror, drama, social commentary, slasher, creature feature, murder mystery, manifesto for vegetarianism - on the way. But while "           Parasite" certainly cycles through more than half that list, the laugh is darker, the snarl more vicious and the sob more despairing than we've ever had from him before. Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so 2019: "Parasite" is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage.
It doesn't start off that way. With typical feint-and-parry dexterity, the film begins as a so-close-it's-almost-self-conscious Korean reworking of last year's Palme d'Or winner "Shoplifters." Here too we have a ramshackle but loving family driven to dubious extremes by poverty-stricken circumstance, and a rumpled patriarch (Song Kang-ho) who bursts amusingly with pride at even the most marginal of his kids' achievements. "Does Oxford have a course in forgery?" he asks admiringly, looking at the fake qualification his daughter Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) has comped together for her brother Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik).
From their squalid "semi-basement" (a couple of dank rooms with a small strip of window against which drunken men are given to urinating) all four members of this family, including their ex-champion shot-putter mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin) struggle to find menial gig-economy jobs and an unlocked wifi signal. But then Ki-woo is offered the chance to replace a friend as the tutor for Da-hye (Jung Ziso), daughter of the wealthy Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun).
Suddenly Ki-woo's days of folding pizza boxes for peanuts are behind him, and instead he gets to hang out with his lovestruck student and her daintily pretty, naive mother Yeon-kyo (Cho Yo-Jeong) in the Parks' spacious architect-designed home. When it turns out Da-hye's hyperactive, "Indian"-obsessed little brother Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) needs an art tutor, Ki-woo spots another opportunity and recommends his sister - in disguise as college acquaintance "Jessica." And so one more cuckoo settles into this luxuriously appointed nest.
Although this is the least loopy title from Bong in a while - there's no room for a cartoonishly broad, heavily dentured Tilda Swinton performance, for example - the first act bounces by with a devil-may-care gait as the scam expands, things start to look up for the family and while they've been roguish, no one has done anything so very unforgivable yet. But even with proceedings at their jauntiest, the sincere classical score from Jung Jae-il and the restraint of the cinematography by Hong Kyung-po (who also shot last year's Korean masterpiece, "Burning") give "Parasite" a sheen of brushed-steel seriousness.
This is the most formally polished work we've seen from Bong: As opposed to the herky-jerk genre-hopping of "The Host," here the story elides so seamlessly from one mood to the next that the joins are near-impossible to find, like those of the poured-concrete walls of the Parks' modernist dream home. Production designer Lee Ha-jun's conception of the two contrasting residences, one a grotty subterranean hovel, the other a clean-lined work of livable art on a gated suburban hillock fringed to perfect privacy with dense trees and shrubs, is a masterful example of evoking class difference through space and light. Those are commodities that apparently only the rich deserve.
It would have been easy for Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won to have made the privileged Parks overtly detestable, but time and again it is asserted just how nice they are. "If I was rich," sighs Chung-sook drunkenly, "I would be nice too. Money is an iron; it smoothes out all the wrinkles." And certainly, Mr. and Mrs. Park live a largely uncreased life, save for the slightest wrinkling of the nose when an unpleasant odor - perhaps the tang of poverty itself - assails them. But for every gut-punch moment of blithe, enraging entitlement on their part, there's an equally horrible instance of selfishness or spite from their less moneyed counterparts: It takes a watchmaker's skill to keep the pendulum of our sympathies swinging back and forth between the grasping desperation of the poor and the idle hatefulness of the rich.
Tiny details, like the mention of a Taiwanese cake shop or the flickering of a hall lamp, all pay off in this most tightly plotted of Bong's films, building to a conclusion that is devastating and yet satisfying as an accretion of a thousand of those little moments. So as plans go awry, quasi-Gothic revelations occur and things get pretty grisly, we've been so wholly worked into Bong's cleverly concealed sympathies that we might shock ourselves by feeling a sense of cathartic rightness at a moment of clearly wrongheaded violence.
The catharsis does not last long, though. As ferocious as this brilliant, caustic film is, with its flawless craft and humor - so dark it's like it, too, was bred in a basement and never saw the sun - it also rumbles constantly with a bleak growl at just how little all this high drama can actually ever matter, an impression reinforced by Hong's dispassionate, almost sardonically pristine camera. Even this grand battle royale between the haves and have-nots will only ever be a squabble at the feet of an indifferent god, or worse still, a sideshow indulged to distract its participants from the real enemy, which is a system that creates and nourishes such divides in the first place. This is the sad little truth evoked in the film's unexpectedly moving final moments: Eat the rich, by all means, fill your bellies, but pretty soon you'll be hungry again, and you will still be poor.

Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite" had been hailed as one of the best films of the year even before it hit theaters in the United States. The film contains elements from a wide variety of genres, especially thrillers and black comedies. Bong's previous directorial endeavors like "Snowpiercer" and "Okja" have found success in the United States, and it looks like "Parasite" will be just as lucrative. 
"Parasite" is a South Korean thriller about an unemployed lower-class family who manages to find employment in the home of a wealthy family. The film premiered at Cannes, where it won the prestigious Palme d'Or. Some moviegoers may be turned off by the fact that the film is in Korean, but missing out on one of the most unique and genuinely enjoyable films of the year would be extremely regrettable. 
The audience is introduced to the lower-class Kim family (played by Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin, Choi Woo-Shik, and Park So-dam) in the opening scenes of the film and it is clear they are not well off financially. The high-class Park family (played by Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Jung Ji-so, and Jung Hyun-joon) has a sleek, beautiful home to house their perfect children. One by one the Kims associate themselves with the Parks, attempting to rid the existing servants there.
The story is presented as a tactful plot to infiltrate the Park household by convincing the parents to hire the Kims individually without the Parks knowing they are all related. The story progresses through the twists and turns of their act, and is an easy contender for Best Original Screenplay. "Parasite" also shares some similarities with Jordan Peele's latest film "Us" which came out earlier this year. Both films deal with issues like social class in an artistic, eye-opening way. "Parasite" also hints at its self-awareness as a film riddled with commentary on privilege, adding to the film's perfect amount of humor.
Bong has crafted a couple of other well-known movies such as "The Host" and "Snowpiercer," both of which some of the highest-grossing South Korean movies of all time. His previous movie "Okja" also competed at Cannes, and Bong has established himself as one of the best filmmakers of the twenty-first century.
"Parasite" is an exciting, beautiful film that raises questions about class relationships and just what lengths a family can go to save each other. Bong Joon-ho tells an enticing narrative that takes the typical family struggle story to new heights.

Jan 20, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite just made history again[1]. On Jan. 19, the cast of Parasite won the award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. With the SAG Awards victory, Parasite became the first foreign-language film to win in that category[2].  Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun Gyun, Park So-dam, Choi Woo-shik, Lee Jeong-eun, and Bong Joon-ho, winner of the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture award for 'Parasite,' | Terence Patrick/Getty Images for TurnerThe movie made history with its Oscar nominations Oscar nominations came out on Jan. 
13, 2020, and Parasite made history with its six nominations. It became thefirst South Korean movie[3]to be nominated for Best Picture and Best International Film. Parasite was nominated for Best Picture withFord v Ferrari,The Irishman,Jojo Rabbit,Joker,Little Women,Marriage Story,1917, andOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood. Bong Joon-ho received an Oscar nomination for Best Director. The film also picked up nominations[4] for Best Original Screenplay, Best Production Design, and Best Film Editing.  The actors in 'Parasite' were snubbed by the Oscars  While Parasite still made history with its Academy Award nominations, the actors of the film were wrongfully snubbed.  'Overlooked Great Acting' headline held by #Parasite[5] director Bong Joon Ho, with cast members Park So-dam and Song Kang-ho pointing. #Parasite[6] actors were all snubbed by the Academy despite the film receiving 6 Oscar nominations. H/t @neonrated[7] pic.twitter.com/XlemtnzU7y[8] — Nancy Wang Yuen (@nancywyuen) January 20, 2020[9];' there were no nominations for any of the actors in the movie —not Song Kang Ho as the tortured father or the dry comedy of Park So-dam or Lee Jeong-eun as the housekeeper who's really the hinge for the crucial turn midway through the film. It's boring to talk about, but it must be said that there's a persistent prejudice against Asian actors within Hollywood,' said[10] Vulture writer E. Alex Jung.He continued[11], 'There's an old prejudice at work here that sees Asian people as technical workers —hence the praise for Bong Joon Ho —and refuses to see us as fully human.'The Los Angeles Times also called out the snubs by the Academy. 'Some might argue that the seamlessness and coherence of the 'Parasite' ensemble may actually have worked against it, keeping any single actor from standing out. To me, that argument is not just false on its face but ugly in its insinuations: It comes close to perpetuating a hoary canard about Asian actors and Asian people in general, which is that they're indistinguishable and interchangeable,' wrote[12] Justin Chang.  Good morning, Parasites. pic.twitter.com/kcFMtfxo4t[13] — NEON (@neonrated) January 20, 2020[14] 'Parasite' made history again with its SAG win Unlike the Oscars, the SAG Awards got it right. Not only was the cast of Parasite nominated, the cast members took home the award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. In doing so, Parasite became the first foreign-langue film to win the award. Parasite is only the second foreign-language film to be nominated for the award. 1997 Italian comedy-drama Life Is Beautiful was the last foreign-language film to be nominated in the same category[15]. The win is warranted given the talent of the cast and the acclaim surrounding the movie. It also shows just how out of touch the Academy Awards are. With the major SAG Awards win, Parasite has gained even more momentum for the upcoming Academy Awards.

[00:00:00]
NATALIE ALLEN, CNN NEWSROOM: And hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from all around the world. I am Natalie Allen.
MICHAEL HOLMES, CNN NEWSROOM: And I am Michael Holmes.
Coming up here on CNN Newsroom, a night full of surprises, as Parasite makes history at the academy awards.
ALLEN: Also ahead here, help is on the way. A team of experts from the World Health Organization heads to the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak. We have a live reporter.
M. HOLMES: And days overdue, the final results of the Iowa caucuses are in as the 2020 Democratic contenders prepared to face off in New Hampshire.
And we begin with the Oscars. For the first time in the history of the academy awards, a non-English language film taking home the top prize of best picture.
ALLEN: It was the wow moment, sure enough. The film and its director, Bong Joon-ho, were also honored for best director, best international feature film and best screenplay. Talk about sweet. The wind is sure to create a lot of incitement in the picture's home country, South Korea. So we want to start right there.
Let's turn to CNN's Paula Hancocks joining us from Pyeongchang. And so many times when we come to you, Paul, it's about North Korea or something dangerous, but now, this is celebration time for South Korea. That's nice.
PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Natalie. I mean, this will go down extremely well here in South Korea. Bong Joon-ho, the director, is very well known here. He is very well respected, and Koreans love his films. But now, they know that the rest of the world loves his films as well, so four Oscars for this particular film. There were six nominations in all, but, of course, it is that best picture, the best film, which is completely key to the success of this film. The fact that it's the first time that it is foreign language, a non-English language film that has taken this accolade.
And we did hear from Bong Joon-ho, the director, as he accepted the award, and he thanked Martin Scorsese. He gave respect to Martin Scorsese, another director, saying that he had inspired him when he was young. He also thanked Quentin Tarantino.
Now, it's interesting, because when we did catch up with him with CNN on the red carpet, just a week ago, at the BAFTAs. He was asked, who do you want to meet with? And he said, Martin Scorsese, and giggled, showing that this is all new to him, that he was loving the fact that he was at these wonderful awards. But it was a new sensation. And now, he is standing up there in front of all of his peers, in front of the world, and thanking those who he believes actually inspired him.
Now, this film, Parasite, it's a remarkable film. It has grossed $160 million worldwide. That really puts it in the realm of the Hollywood blockbusters, and yet it is a Korean film. It's a film about the class war around the world. It's based in South Korea but it's a poor family who inserts itself into a rich family's household, into their lives with devastating effects. I'm not going to give any more of the plot away from that, because if you have not seen it, you should see it. And it is remarkable that this has made history tonight.
ALLEN: Yes. And it was also kind of really cool as they stood on stage, having to have a translator for the audience there at the Oscars. I don't know when I have seen that.
So, now, the world knows Bong Joon-ho. He is adorable from his many times at the microphone, but how well-known is he in South Korea?
HANCOCKS: He's very well known here in South Korea. He is a household name. He has done many films. This is by no means his first hit. He has had a number of hits here in South Korea and has been done this for some time.
And now I spoke to a director who's also a friend of Bong Joon-ho and asked him about this. And he said, this was before the Oscars, obviously, but it was after he won the Palme d'Or. It was after the BAFTAs, the SAG Awards, winning many accolades around the world. And he said he felt like he was in a dream.
And he also said that it was like the Korean people as a whole felt this was like a dream. They know him and they know that he is a wonderful director and his films to do well. But now, the rest of the world knows it as well.
So for many Koreans who know about this, I was just at lunch here with some Koreans when we heard the news. I told them the news, and there was applause.
[00:05:03]
They were absolutely delighted that Bong Joon-ho has had this international recognition, Nat.
ALLEN: Yes, absolutely. And an ensemble cast. You could tell they were all just shocked and absolutely thrilled when they took the stage.
All right, really cool, Paula Hancocks for us in South Korea. Thanks, Paula.
All right, we get back to other news now. We turn to China, where officials are trying to contain the Wuhan coronavirus, are about to get some more help.
M. HOLMES: That's right. The World Health Organization says a team of experts has been sent to the country to investigate the outbreak. Now, this coming as the number of deaths and infections continues to climb. The global death toll from the virus has now passed 900, all but two of those cases coming from mainland China.
ALLEN: The disease has now killed 871 people in Hubei Province alone. That's the epicenter of the outbreak. Meantime, the number of infections worldwide now exceeds 40,000, again, with the vast majority in China.
Meantime, in Wuhan, another person who spoke about virus appears to have disappeared. Steven Jiang is our reporter live in Beijing for us.
Steven, you've been covering this since the start. We, of course, know, about the doctor who first recognized the virus who ended up dying. And now, we have something else that's curious. What can you tell us?
STEVEN JIANG, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: That's right, Natalie. The disappearing citizen journalist reminded a lot of people of the doctor you mentioned, Dr. Li Wenliang, who, of course, passed away on Friday, after he contracted this very virus he was trying to warn others about back in December.
Now, this citizen journalist, Chen Qiushi, he shared something in common with the doctor. They were both 34 years old from the northeastern part of this country. But Mr. Chen had been roaming around in Wuhan for some two weeks before he disappeared last Thursday. Now, his friends and family are telling us he was taken away by local police and placed under forced quarantine ostensibly for his own health.
But friends are saying they are now worried about his safety because the authorities obviously view him as a troublemaker. During his time in Wuhan, Mr. Chen took his camera to the hospitals, to the streets of Wuhan in the epicenter and he really captured a grim picture sometimes in stark contrast to what the state media was trying to present to the audience here.
Mr. Chen filmed the desperation of people trying to seek medical help but to no avail. He filmed the helplessness of many who said they have lost loved ones, seeing loved ones dying in front of their eyes, and also he filmed the overwhelming situation there, both in the hospitals there and even in the morgue. Natalie?
ALLEN: Yes. And, Steven, what does his disappearance mean to the people of China who have really been speaking against Beijing after the death of the doctor and calling for openness and free speech since this? What do you think this will do for the citizens who've had enough of this?
JIANG: That's really interesting. Because, obviously, this citizen journalist, Mr. Chen's social media account had long been closed here in China, but he managed to host his videos on YouTube and attracting millions of views and with huge attention, including from within China. People imagine the scale of this so-called firewall to actually try and to find out what he found out on the ground in Wuhan.
Now, the silencing of him, of course, reminded a lot of them the silencing of the doctor. And this also, of course, happening at a time when the authorities here are trying to ramp up their propaganda, trying to increasingly shape news coverage and online conversations about this outbreak. They are now, it seems to be, not only trying to control the flow of people as they try to contain the virus, but also increasingly the flow of information. Natalie?
ALLEN: And that can't help to save lives, really. It's just very a shame. All right. Steven Jiang for us, thank you so much.
Now, Michael?
M. HOLMES: All right. Thanks, Natalie.
Dr. Carlos Del Rio is a professor of Global Health and Medicine at Emory University. He joins us now live from Colorado. You have talked to us before on this, and let's continue the conversation.
It was interesting and a bit concerning that within a month or so, coronavirus overtook the death toll of SARS, which made its death toll in eight months. I mean, what do you make of the spread and importantly, the mortality of this virus so far?
DR. CARLOS DEL RIO, PROFESSOR, MEDICINE AND GLOBAL HEALTH, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Good evening, Michael. Well, there are two issues. Number one, this virus is a lot more transmissible, more contagious than SARS or MERS is.
[00:10:06]
So the transmission resembles more influenza, and the mortality resembles more influenza, so I like to think of this virus more as an influence-like virus. This is a very severe -- this virus is spreading very rapidly into a lot of people.
But the mortality, if you think of the number of people infected, I think there's about 40,000 recorded cases, but there might might be two or three times of that in reality, so let's say just 120,000 cases. 800 deaths, maybe the deaths are underreported, so maybe double that. But still maybe 2 percent of the deaths and --2 percent of the patients are dying. So the mortality is a lot lower than we've seen in prior coronaviruses. And so --
M. HOLMES: A very relevant point.
I wanted to ask you too about a medical reporter that I know you are aware of. It found more than 40 percent of patients diagnosed at one hospital in Wuhan, in China, were presumed to have been infected in that hospital, and only patients that were sick were tested. So it could have been even more transmission than that. What did we learn about that, about preventing the transmission in the future?
DEL RIO: Well, we've seen this with other coronaviruses, with SARS and with MERS. We've seen what we physicians call nosocomial transmission, which is transmission in hospitals, not only to other patients, but to healthcare workers. And we've also seen this, for example, Ebola transmission to other healthcare workers.
So what we learn is that with all of these (ph) infections, we have to take special precautions in hospitals. We have to make sure we isolate potential cases, we do the appropriate and we have decisions on health. We have healthcare personnel who use what we call personal protective equipment used appropriately to prevent us from getting infected.
So one of the things that hospitals are doing right now is refreshing the training on how to put on and put off what we call don on and don off the personal protective equipment so we can actually be prepared in case of (INAUDIBLE) like this.
M. HOLMES: Yes. One other thing that -- and we touched on last time we spoke, and I think it's perhaps even more important now. The risk if this gets to a more secretive country, one without the resources to deal with it or the honesty to acknowledge a problem in the first place. I mean, There have been reports, we don't know if they are true, but in the South Korean media of cases in North Korea. A major parade was canceled this weekend. What are the risks if it does happen in a country like that, which probably would just want to hide it?
DEL RIO: Well, North Korean, I'm not too concerned, because there's not a lot of communication to the outside world, so it will stay there. But I think it is a concern, quite frankly, as, for example, cases in Africa. There's a huge growth in the past decade (INAUDIBLE). Many airlines have cut flights but a few (ph) airlines continues flying. So there're (INAUDIBLE) at Bali International Airport screening passengers that are coming from China.
But my biggest concern is that if this virus gets to a place China, like India or Africa, for example, because they are going to spread (INAUDIBLE) a lot more serious than we've currently seen.
M. HOLMES: Yes, a very, very good point. Dr. Carlos Del Rio, thank you so much, I apreciate your expertise on this. Thank you.
DEL RIO: Thank you, Michael, and have a good evening. ALLEN: Coming up here, it was touch and go at London's Heathrow airport as high winds made mess of air travel across Northern Europe and wait until we show you some of the landings.
M. HOLMES: We will be right back.
[00:15:00]
ALLEN: All right. Well, it took a while but after days of waiting and confusion, the Iowa Democratic Party says U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has won the most delegates in the Iowa caucuses.
M. HOLMES: It feels like it was a year ago, doesn't it?
ALLEN: I know.
M. HOLMES: Yes. The updated numbers show the former South Bend, Indiana mayor with a very slim lead over Bernie Sanders, who won the popular vote and that's annoying his supporters. The Sanders campaign, in fact, says it's going to ask for a partial re-canvass of the results on Monday.
Now, after the Democratic debacle in Iowa, and it was that, voters in New Hampshire are going to go to the polls on Tuesday. It's not a caucus, it is the first in the nation primary.
ALLEN: Democratic hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden are looking to make up ground after coming in third and fourth respectively in Iowa.
For more, Jeff Zeleny is on the campaign trail.
JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: And with a little more than one day left before the New Hampshire primary voting begins, Bernie Sanders is feeling confident, and this is one of the reasons why.
Our latest poll shows that he is seven percentage points up over his nearest rival, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. But Elizabeth Warren, one of his key competitors for so many months here in New Hampshire, is even trailing farther than that. Joe Biden, of course, also making his way, Amy Klobuchar is below him.
So the question here in the final hours of this campaign, could this dynamic change? The New Hampshire primary has a history of delivering surprises so it certainly could. And there is somewhat of a circular firing squad going on here. We have seen Joe Biden aggressively taking on Pete Buttigieg. We've seen Pete Buttigieg, of course, defending himself all over experience. but we're also hearing from Bernie Sanders. Question for the first time, by name, Pete Buttigieg in how he is raising money.
Throughout the duration of his campaign for the last year or more and certainly throughout the Iowa campaign, Bernie Sanders didn't mention of his rivals by name. He did not criticize Pete Buttigieg. He did that as he is campaigning in New Hampshire, pointing out that he is raising money in his words from billionaires. Of course, nothing illegal about that, but Bernie Sanders raises his money just bit by bit over the internet and online contributions, small dollar donations raising it for the long haul.
So the question here is will voters side with Bernie Sanders, certainly, the most progressive candidate in this race or will the independent voters of New Hampshire so critical here, representing about a third of the voters. Well, they think that Bernie Sanders is simply too liberal.
[00:20:04]
Those are some of the closing dynamics here we are watching.
So Senator Sanders is a clear favorite. He won the state by 21 percentage points four years ago. He's from neighboring Vermont, so all signs would indicate a strong night for him. But, again, New Hampshire can deliver surprises and can the humble frontrunners as well. So in the final hours of this campaigning here, we'll see if this circular firing squad hits anyone or if Senator Sanders goes on to win it. If he does, it certainly puts him in a strong position for the remainder of the contest coming up this month.
ALLEN: Well, not to be outdone, U.S. President Trump is also headed to New Hampshire to fire up his supporters.
M. HOLMES: CNN's Kristen Holmes with that side of the story.
KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: If Monday night's rally in New Hampshire looks anything like this weekend, President Trump will be in full attack mode. On Sunday, he spent the day on Twitter lashing out at Democrats for everything, from impeachment to the Iowa caucus. He also hit those senators who voted against him in impeachment.
I want to read one of these tweets in particular. He says, they are really mad at Senator Joe Munchkin, he means Joe Manchin, in West Virginia. He couldn't understand the transcripts. Romney could but didn't want to. He also lashed at a Democratic Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, saying, he was looking forward to beating him in this election.
It should be noted that these messages are really intended for his base. They are intended to rile up his supporters, which they will do. And back in 2016, President Trump shocked the political establishment winning the New Hampshire primary using this kind of rhetoric.
But as we head into his re-election, it is a bit of a different scenario this time around. His own campaign advisers have acknowledged that in order to win in 2020, President Trump will have to court some of those moderate voters. So as he picks up on the campaign trail, that is one thing that we are watching very closely. How will he marry his tweets and his rhetoric at these rallies with the courting of the moderate voter or will he at all? Will there be any change as he begins really ramping up this campaign season?
Kristen Holmes, CNN, the White House.
M. HOLMES: Now to Ireland, where Sinn Fein has won the most seats so far in the first count of votes in the general election. That count is still underway. It might even take weeks before a coalition could be formed.
ALLEN: The current prime minister says he is unwilling to govern with Sinn Fein, the party once associated with the Irish Republican Army. He calls the idea a forced marriage.

LEO VARADKAR, IRISH PRIME MINISTER: In order to form a government together, we have to have the same -- roughly the same views around the courts and the criminal justice system, around how the economy should be built (ph) and also how to (INAUDIBLE). And that's what makes my party not compatible with Sinn Fein. We are willing to talk to other parties about how we could form a government.
MARY LOU MCDONALD, PRESIDENT, SINN FEIN PARTY: It's a big statement of change. It is a big statement that this is no longer a two-party system. It's a statement that people want at different type governments, and that people have great confidence and I say that with all humility.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALLEN: So an exit poll suggested an unprecedented three-way tie between the main parties.
Well, the storm named Ciara has slammed Northern Europe with heavy rains and high winds in early Sunday, the weather forced a dramatic event in London. We'll show you.
M. HOLMES: Yes, no harm done. But have a look at this, a passenger jet struggling to land at Heathrow because of those cross winds there. Does the old touch and go, it touches down and then the landing gets aborted and the pilot takes off again and does what they call a go- around. And the plane did land safely on the second try. t would've been a bit nerve-wrecking for everyone on board.
ALLEN: White-knuckling.
M. HOLMES: Absolutely, white-knuckle flying out.
Our aviation expert, Richard Quest, says pilots are trained in these touch and goes, but it's very unusual, he said, for such a large passenger jet to do it.
ALLEN: But the pilot did it.
M. HOLMES: Yes, they're good at it. Yes.
ALLEN: Yes, they are. Thank goodness. And while that jet struggled with the strong winds, another got quite boost. A New York to London flight broke the record for subsonic air travel due to the powerful tail winds across the Atlantic.
M. HOLMES: Yes. It landed almost two hours ahead of schedule, pretty pleasing unless you had someone driving up to the airport to meet you, Karen Maginnis.
KAREN MAGINNIS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Exactly. Yes. And the wind is just one aspect of what we've seen with this system and, yes, want to be on an aircraft where you know you are crabbing into the landing is very unnerving. It's happened to me one time. And, yes, for such a large aircraft to have to go around again is also unnerving.
But the wind, as I mentioned, is just one aspect.
[00:25:01]
There was flooding rain, there was reduced visibility. It impacted almost every aspect of life across United Kingdom and into Ireland. Here's some of the wind gusts. We had a wind gust reported over 200 kilometers per hour.
Now, the winds are still going to be there even going into Monday, lingering into Tuesday. But by then, we're seeing that impact across the mainland of Europe. All of these areas from around Paris, into Frankfurt, all the way into Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, that's where we're going to see some of the stronger winds with the rainfall. So anticipate river flooding here, problems with transportation. They are saying that Ciara is one of the strongest storm systems that has been seen across the United Kingdom since 1993.
All right, for the most part, I just took a look at some of the weather conditions across London into Scotland. It's cold. There is a very cold rain. The wind is fairly brisk. But we are looking at even more precipitation making its way into the lowlands and into Paris, also into Germany and then winding its way further towards the east. So there are amber alerts out for a good portion of the U.K., even going into Monday, but also going into Tuesday as well.
And look at this phenomenal picture of the waves crashing and we think of the wind, as I mentioned, but there was at least knee-deep precipitation in some areas. The flights were delayed, trains were seen being interrupted by trees on railroad tracks. There you see one tree on a roadway there, so plenty of damage. Also going into the forecast for Tuesday from Scotland all the way to Northern Ireland and in the region around Manchester, amber alert for gusty winds and could be near blizzard conditions.
Back to you, guys.
ALLEN: All right
M. HOLMES: Wow, that is.
ALLEN: Rough stuff. M. HOLMES: That is, isn't it? Yes, very severe. Karen Maginnis, Thank you.
ALLEN: All right. Still to come here, crews under quarantine, thousands of passengers remain on lockdown on a ship in Japan as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise on board. We'll go live to Yokohama with the latest.
M. HOLMES: And then later in the program, the winners, the losers, the big surprises at the Oscars, a good night to be Korean. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:30:00]
HOLMES: Welcome back. The number of cases of coronavirus on that cruise ship in Yokohama, Japan, continues to climb as thousands on board are under lockdown. Six new cases confirmed on the Diamond Princess on Sunday, bringing the total number to 70. And once the ship did dock there, where several people were taken off to hospitals for quarantine.
Let's get the very latest now from Matt Rivers, who's on the spot for us in Yokohama. Bring us the latest on those patient passengers and those who aren't patients, are patient.
MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Yes, that's one way to put it, Michael. They're being as patient as they can be, given the fact that they are quarantined on this ship until February 19 at the earliest at this point.
We did get some -- a little bit of new information from the Japanese government this morning, with government officials telling CNN that they do plan on, or at least are considering testing every single person on board that ship.
Previously, they were testing those who had come in close contact with people who had already been diagnosed with the virus or people who were exhibiting symptoms. But now it appears that they are going to go through and test every single person path on that ship, which is a lengthy process, given the amount of people on board. There's some 3,700 people, minus those who have already been taken off. But that still leaves thousands of people that need testing.
This comes at the same time as the Japanese government continues to deliver supplies to those on board, including masks. One of the things here in Japan that you're going to see everybody doing on the streets, generally, is wearing these surgical masks they believe will help prevent the spread of this infection. Except, in kind of a cruel twist, a lot of the world's production of masks comes from Wuhan, which is the center of where this outbreak started, including Japan's supply of masks.
And so what the Japanese government has said is they are going to help companies here in Japan ramp up their own position of masks, which will, of course, go to some people on that ship. But the vast majority of which will be, you know, bought by the private market here, you know, just by ordinary people on the mainland.
HOLMES: Yes. That is extraordinary, masks from Wuhan.
You know, we were speaking to a passenger on the program the other day. You know, you're in touch with a lot of passengers. She was saying that they were concerned whether the quarantine deadline date that they'd been given would perhaps restart with every new infection, and that was something that concerned her. What do you know about that date?
RIVERS: We've been asking that question to Japanese officials and to U.S. government officials, and they are saying no, that is not going to be pushed back. Now, that could always change. I mean, this is a very fluid situation, but as of now, this date of February 19 is what these governments are sticking to. They are saying that that is when the quarantine period is going to end, despite the fact that new cases have been reported. They haven't changed that.
But with the caveat there that they always give is that, look, this is changing. You know, if there is a rash of new cases that come out on board this ship, if something happens where they feel like they need to extend that quarantine period, they will. But as of now, the fears that the passenger that you spoke to yesterday and others that we've spoken to, that this -- this period may go forward, they do seem to be unfounded, at least according to the government officials that we're speaking to.
HOLMES: All right. Matt Rivers, appreciate it. There on the spot in Yokohama for us. Thanks so much.
NATALIE ALLEN, CNN ANCHOR: Oscar voters have spoken. Just ahead, we have the historic winners, the losers and all the highlights from the Academy Awards.
[00:36:36]
ALLEN: All right. Back to our top story. The 2020 Academy Awards. In case you were watching, the Korean black comedy "Parasite" is the big winner of the night, and it made history in the process. It has become the first non-English film to win the top prize of Best Picture. It's the 92nd Academy Awards.
Bong Joon Ho is also taking home the Best Director award for the film. Joaquin Phoenix wins Best Actor for his performance in "Joker." That was expected. Renee Zellweger, also expected, with the Best Actress for the title role in "Judy."
Brad Pitt won for Best Supporting Actor in Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood." And Laura Dern taking home Best Supporting Actress for her performance in "Marriage Story."
For more on the winners, losers and surprises, let's turn to film critic Richard Fitzwilliams.
Richard, "Parasite" rules the night. What did you think of that one?
RICHARD FITZWILLIAMS, FILM CRITIC: Well, I think it was a very historic day for the Oscars, and also an extremely significant one for cinema internationally, because Hollywood has always been synonymous with the film industry. I mean, there's no showcase like the Oscars. And always before -- and this is the 12th film that was not in the English language to be nominated for Best Picture -- none of the others have one. And this, against the odds, "1917" by Sam Mendes, a remarkable film, was nonetheless beaten into second place by "Parasite," which is an absolutely chilling example of social injustice, which has been highlighted by Bong Joon Ho, a South Korean director who really showed absolutely extraordinary magnetism in the way he handled this movie.
And it's a dark comedy. It will lead you down into, shall we say, recesses which you did not think you would be going down when you originally begin watching this film.
And the electrifying moment was when Bong Joon Ho won Best Director, and then the film won Best International Feature Film, which is the new name for Best Foreign Film. And subsequently, we were prepared, I think, for what actually happened, which of course, was the defeat of "1917" and "Parasite's" victory.
ALLEN: Yes. And it was really cool when he pointed out a line that he heard years ago, that he bases his movies on, and then he said it was Martin Scorsese who said that line. And of course, he just beat his hero as Best Director.
Let's move to Joaquin Phoenix. He gave a very emotional acceptance speech, very deep about inequality and all areas of life. It was quite beautiful.
FITZWILLIAMS: It was, indeed. And I mean, he feels tremendously strongly about this. He did it at the BAFTAs, as well, where he condemned systemic racism. And there's no question that Phoenix speaks from the heart. His roles -- he more or less inhabits these parts. And it was an amazing performance in an ultra-violent movie. "Joker" certainly shakes you up.
But he is a deeply, deeply sincere individual, and this comes across in his speeches. We expected him to win. There was no question about that, just as Renee Zellweger won playing Judy Garland and pointed out that she herself had never won an Oscar, and this was truly remarkable, playing a role which she found so deeply moving.
[00:40:18]
Also, Brad Pitt and I have to ask who writes Brad Pitt's speeches, because they're always hits? I mean, this is one of Oscar's mysteries at the moment. And Laura Dern, of course, as we expected, Best Supporting Actress.
ALLEN: Right. And you know, it's kind of like a comeback for Renee Zellweger, wasn't it? I mean, she kind of went away from Hollywood, and she came back with a zinger.
FITZWILLIAMS: Well, of course, she'd won before with "Cold Mountain." And when I saw "Judy," I mean, the film got mixed reviews, but there's no question she was able to inhabit Judy Garland's character in her last period, and make it tremendously moving.
And I think that, in a speech that was -- it was quite long, actually, I noticed that this -- in this ceremony you didn't have the orchestra striking up when speeches went over 45 seconds, which is just as well.
ALLEN: Yes.
FITZWILLIAMS: And I think relishing this moment, but also using it in a very, very sincere way to communicate with her audience, which I thought she did beautifully, it really was a remarkable moment. And it was an evening, as well, which showed that the Academy Awards can move along as a swift pace without a host. It was rather fun seeing Steve Martin and Chris Rock, who hosted in the past, just briefly appear and say how relieved they were they didn't have the responsibility. But in fact, this is the way, I think, for the -- for the ceremony to move on quite quickly.
ALLEN: Right.
FITZWILLIAMS: With songs including Elton John's for "Rocketman," of course.
ALLEN: Yes. We were talking about that in the newsroom. You know, after a while, you're like, OK, enough already, but you know, it was a pretty cool ceremony tonight, wouldn't you agree, Michael?
HOLMES: I agree.
ALLEN: So back to "Parasite." Last thing from you. Is this a game changer for Hollywood?
FITZWILLIAMS: It's undoubtedly a game changer for Hollywood and also for the entire worldwide motion picture industry, because what we'll also see, I hope, is the Best Actor and Best Actress categories open up more to those -- there have been 36 nominated over the years, but only three have won: Sophia Loren for "Two Women," Marion Cotillard playing Edith Piaf in "Ma Vie en Rose," and Roberto Benigni for "Life is Beautiful." And that's over 92 years.
It will open us up much more to non-English cinema, and also this is, I think, a gesture towards inclusivity. We've been critical of the Oscars this year for a lack of diversity. Well, you couldn't get anything more inclusive than the ceremony that you've just had.
ALLEN: Absolutely. It's nice to see it's going global.
All right. Richard, always a pleasure. Thanks so much for coming on.
FITZWILLIAMS: Great pleasure.
ALLEN: All right. We've got to go see "Parasite."
HOLMES: I do, too. And our colleague, Kristie Lu Stout, has been tweeting, saying there's -- recommending a bunch of these other movies, "Snowpiercer." I've never heard of it. They're apparently fantastic. I liked his last line, one of his few lines in English: "And I shall drink until morning."
ALLEN: I know. He said that, like, two or three times on stage.
HOLMES: I think everybody -- yes.
ALLEN: He deserves it.
HOLMES: Thanks for watching CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Michael Holmes.
ALLEN: I'm Natalie Allen. WORLD SPORT's next. We'll see you in 15.

Knocking Down the One-Inch Barrier: Parasite Wins

There was a moment, a tangible moment, where Director Bong transcended from "well-respected director" and became a bona-fide Savior of Cinema. It was right after Parasite won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture, Foreign Language. It was a significant win, signaling many more to come (not that we knew that at the time). Director Bong got on the stage, along with his translator Sharon Choi, and proceeded to deliver this iconic quote: "Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films"
It's been five months since Parasite was released in the US last year, and just one month since its historic (and well-deserved) win at the Academy Awards, so famous for getting it so spectacularly wrong, who here got it spectacularly right (it's a decision so good, it almost makes up for Green Book two years ago. You know, almost). Here's how you know this one's gonna last, how we've got a long-lasting masterpiece on our hands; it's been a month, and the feeling about Parasite winning all those Oscars is still one of elation. Apart from some inane ramblings from our Commander in Chief (weird, how easy it is to block that out after a while. We've had some practice...), there's been absolutely nothing substantial in the way of pushback, or backlash, or any "Hot Takes" about the validity of the movie; was Parasite reeeeeeeeaaaally that good? Everyone seems to be on the same page that, yes, yes it was. Parasite is now in the coveted position that films like Schindler's List, No Country for Old Men or Unforgiven have, where there were other good movies that came out those years (seriously go back and look; 2007 wasstacked when it came to content), but general consensus seems to be, "Yeah that was the right call."
Months (and many viewings) later, what I initially said about Parasite still holds true. If you've not seen it yet, the best thing to do is to go in as blind as possible. The joy of Parasite has to do with how seamlessly Director Bong (who wrote the movie along with Han Jin-own) toys with expectations; I mentioned in my initial review that, for American audiences who only know Director Bong through his slightly straighter genre pieces, like his monster movie sendup The Host, or his action movie Snowpiercer, the free range he has over every genre or tone in the book might throw them for a loop. Is this a drama? A comedy? A parable? A social satire? Who cares? It's anything and everything, and it is magnificent.
As has been said before, and with more eloquence, the parasites in Parasite are very human. Or maybe it's society. Either way Parasite has to do with an impoverished, unemployed family of four; a son, a daughter, a father and a mother. There is a striking opening scene in which a fumigation crew starts dusting the street outside, and the family makes the decision to leave their windows open. After all, this way their roach problem gets dealt with. For free! Things kick off when a friend of Ki-woo-the son in the family-asks him to fill in as a tutor to the daughter of a rich family. The friend is going on vacation, and doesn't trust any of the other tutors at his school not to make lecherous advances at the rich family's underage daughter. He suggests to Ki-woo that the latter assumes his identity; a deception, sure, but a harmless one.
Things take an interesting turn when Ki-woo - under the assumed name "Kevin" - first arrives at the house of the wealthy Park family. Or, more accurately, their mansion. They live on a hill in the sky, surrounded by luxury, with wide open space and amenities as far as the eye can see. The contrast between them and the Kim family - who we see live in a sub-basement hovel that routinely gets pissed on by drunk passerbys - is striking. The difference between the two families is made immediately apparent; their social standing is emphasized by the geography. They are literally miles above the poor. Thanks to the hedges, they don't even have to look at them most of the time.
Upon finding himself immersed in their world, "Kevin" concocts a plan. It's innocent enough - the Park family's hyperactive son needs an art therapist, and in an apparently off-the-cuff flash of inspiration, Ki-woo suggests his sister. Never mind that she's not got a degree in any of the places "Kevin" suggests that she has; a bit of light forgery will soon fix that. As for the fact that she's got no idea what the responsibilities of an art therapist actually are? Eh, she can fake it 'till she makes it.
It's down to Director Bong's extraordinary skills as a storyteller that I still didn't quite know where the story was going from this point forward. It was only when Ki-jung - AKA "Jessica" - engaged in a blatant act of manipulation in order to get the Park family driver fired, that I began to connect the dots. Sure enough, for a while there Parasite becomes a downright Hitchcokian thriller of false identity and unbearable suspense, as slowly but surely the entire Kim family has invaded the home of the Park family, posing as the help.
And that's only the beginning. From there, well, that's where the conversation lies. Is Parasite a scathing satire on Capitalism? Is it - I already did this multiple questions thing earlier. Here's what it is; brilliant, and totally in control of itself. It completely and perfectly wrangles every plot thread and thematic undercurrent in a fashion that seems singular. It's multiple messages, but at all times, it all seems to be coalesced into one message. Like I said in my initial review, I never felt that Director Bong was just throwing whatever he wanted at the wall, and seeing what stuck. There's a purpose to every tonal shift; absolutely none of it is "random." Every zany digression, or apparent non-sequitur, it's all built into the very fabric of the film. And the end result is a film experience that I couldn't predict the end of, or even the next scene of, but in the end it all worked.
There are layers upon layers to Parasite. This is a smart, complex, important, but ultimately enjoyable movie, and you have no idea how much it warms my heart and gives me hope that so many American audiences responded so rapturously to its release. Director Bong knows the score: once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you really will be introduced to so many more amazing films. Trust me; it's true.

Oscars 2020: #8216;Parasite' and #8216;Jojo Rabbit' Just Took a Big Step Toward the Oscar Stage

Feb 03, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Oscars is shaping up to be filled with tight races.Whenever the awards season comes around, industry insiders are all watching to note any trends. If a film wins a Golden Globe[1] or other award, pundits believe it bodes well for that movie's Oscar chances. Of course, a lot can change from the beginning of awards season to Oscar night.But now the 2020 Academy Awards are so close. And it feels like the winners are crystallizing. 
All four acting awards[2] — barring any major upsets — are just about locked in. Likewise, 1917 is the clear frontrunner for Best Picture. Now it looks like two other Best Picture nominees are about to own two other categories. Taika Waititi and Bong Joon-ho at the Oscars Nominees Luncheon | Kevork Djansezian/Getty ImagesThe same two Best Picture nominees had a very big awards weekend Of the many awards considered precursors for the Oscars, all had been given out except two. The Writer's Guild of America represents both branches of the U.S. labor unions, including both film and television writers. And the WGA Awards[3] offer a hint of what Oscar voters — or, at least, the writers in the academy — might be thinking.Likewise, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts presents annual awards widely considered the British equivalent to the Oscars. Unlike the WGA Awards, the BAFTA Awards[4] recognize cinematic accomplishments across various departments. In fact, it features nearly identical categories to the Academy Awards, making for a very easy comparison between the two.Both the WGA and BAFTA award ceremonies took place recently. And though they only have two categories in common, they chose to recognize the very same films. Taika Waititi won Best Adapted Screenplay for Jojo Rabbit[5], while Parasite[6] writers Bong Joon HoandHan Jin Won shared Best Original Screenplay. View this post on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/B7QxKC6BJkc/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading Congratulations to this year's #Oscars nominees! Click the link in our bio for the full list.[7] A post shared by The Academy[8] (@theacademy) on Jan 13, 2020 at 5:45am PSTThe screenplay Oscar races are really heating up now Of course, Waititi and Bong also directed their films, which boosts their visibility and likely their Oscar chances. But what makes these WGA and BAFTA wins so impressive is how competitive the screenplay categories at the Oscars are.After all, fellow directors Quentin Tarantino, Greta Gerwig, Rian Johnson, Noah Baumbach, and Todd Phillips are all nominated for Oscars for either writing or co-writing their films. In fact, Tarantino and Gerwig were considered likely frontrunners for their original and adapted screenplays, respectively.But the WGA and BAFTA wins tell a very different story. Waititi and Bong are now gearing up for likely wins for their writing. If they do take the Oscars, the filmmakers' more offbeat tales will defeat more traditional Oscar films like Martin Scorsese's gangster epic [9]The Irishman[10] and Sam Mendes' war drama [11]1917[12]. Buddies who won baby humpback whale tails. #WgaAwards[13] @jojorabbitmovie[14] pic.twitter.com/g9UwZrwPve[15] — Taika Waititi (@TaikaWaititi) February 2, 2020[16]; Will either Taika Waititi or Bong Joon-ho win at the Oscars? Both Parasite and Jojo Rabbit are nominated for six Oscars[17] this year. The former has, of course, dominated the conversation as of late. One of the most critically acclaimed films of the year, Parasite is a lock to walk away with Best International Feature and is gaining steam in Best Picture[18]. So if Parasite wins Best Original Screenplay — as many feel it deserves — that win is far from the film's only or even best shot at Oscar gold.On the other hand, Jojo Rabbit hasn't been nearly as talked about in the awards circuit. In fact, Waititi's film has been on a consistent losing streak at most of the major Oscar precursors. These back-to-back wins could indicate its destiny as an Oscar-winning film. Jojo Rabbit did land a surprise Best Supporting Actress nomination[19] for Scarlett Johansson. So perhaps the writing was on the wall all along for Waititi to claim a trophy.We'll find out soon enough how well Jojo Rabbit and Parasite do on Oscar night. The 92nd Academy Awards air on ABC on Feb. 9, 2020.

Film reviews: Parasite; Mr Jones; A lustrous mash-up of thriller and social commentary, Parasite will sink its teeth into you, says Tom Shone

The Korean director Bong Joon Ho's movies can be divided into two sorts: those with monsters and those without. His latest, 
                   Parasite                   
, sounds as if it should be in the former category, alongside 
                   Okja                   
 and 
                   The Host                   
, but actually belongs in the latter, with 
                   Snowpiercer                   
 and 
                   Mother                   
 - although, by the end of it, you're not so sure.
We tend to make a sharp distinction between genre movies and those with "something to say". Bong fails to notice that divide: he's made a lustrous, vibrant genre mash-up of Hitchcock thriller, social commentary, European art film and Korean schlock cinema. I don't know what to call it except a genie that, once conjured, plays in your head for weeks. A parasite, you say?
Meet the Kim family, whose sole source of income derives from folding pizza boxes. They live virtually underground, in a crowded, messy flat partially below street level, through the window of which they are lucky to catch a glimpse of a drunk pissing against a wall, or get a free wi-fi signal. One day, the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), lands a private tutoring gig in a gated mansion at the top of a hill that belongs to a rich architect named Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) and his wife, Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Behind a lush canopy of trees and an entrance that makes a thick kerchunk sound like a vault, Ki-woo must prepare the couple's teenage daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), for college. Ki-woo has failed his entrance exam four times, but what's a piece of paper when your sister is a dab hand at Photoshop?
One deception quickly begets another. When the younger Park boy, a spoilt brat obsessed with tomahawks, turns out to require a therapist to help him with his art, Ki-woo puts the family in touch with his sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), introducing her as "Jessica". So now there are two of them in the lap of luxury. Next up, a job for dad, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), after they frame the chauffeur; and when the long-serving, long-suffering housekeeper (Lee Jeong-eun) takes her eye off the ball, they hoodwink the Parks into hiring their mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), instead. So now there are four of them there, a full set. When the Parks go on a camping trip, the Kims simply move in for the weekend. "Rain falling on the lawn as we sip our whiskies," Ki-taek says, smiling broadly, sloppily drunk.
Who wouldn't sympathise? At the same time, who isn't absolutely certain that a comeuppance is on the way? (Keep your eye on that fired housekeeper, for the real fun has not even begun.)
Plugging into our universal disquiet about the inequality between the haves and have-nots, Bong has fashioned a darkly enjoyable class-war thriller in which the real monster is global capitalism itself, but there is nothing heady or didactic about it. The plot clicks into place like a Rubik's cube, and the action is storyboarded with the pounce and snap of a manga comic. There is violence, yet it feels as clean and gleaming as the Parks' kitchen, around which the camera prowls like a house cat. If you've ever wondered what a production designer does, check out the immaculate, minimalist surfaces of the mansion, with its marble tables and built-in closets, then see the dramatic purposes to which each are put, and that's before we've realised there's a basement. I haven't seen the architectural plans of a house prove so integral to a movie's plot since 
                   Psycho                   
.
This film's working title was 
                   Decalcomania                   
 - the process of transferring designs from paper onto glass or porcelain, creating a mirror image, or doppelganger. It's a kinder title than 
                   Parasite                   
, to be sure, although trying to work out who exactly is the parasite of the title can be instructive.
The Kims feel no malice toward the Parks, who in their own way are quite likeable, even Mr Park, with his haughty conviction that the people who ride on the subway have a certain "smell".The Kims "invade" the Parks' home not to rob or kill them, but merely to earn a living. Nor are they impoverished saints - they are sprawling and a little selfish, and they get messily drunk - so you never feel hectored by a thesis. The film is far too seductive for that. Gliding from social commentary to horror movie to 
                   grand guignol                   
 farce, in which every detail - a tomahawk, a walkie-talkie, a flickering lightbulb - is orchestrated with split-second timing and loaded with portent, 
                   Parasite                   
 has the feel of a modern classic.
Agnieszka Holland's 
                   Mr Jones                   
 begins with a writer (Joseph Mawle) in the late 1940s, bashing out an allegory about totalitarianism with farm animals on a typewriter. No, it's not a biopic of George Orwell, but something more interesting. It's a film about the Welsh journalist whose work exposing the Holodomor - the famine caused by Stalin's agricultural policies, which killed 10 million people - partly inspired Orwell's book.
Beginning with a scene in which the 27-year-old Gareth Jones (James Norton) is laughed out of the Foreign Office by Lloyd George's cabinet for suggesting that war with Nazi Germany is imminent, the film starts out as a noirish, 
                   Third Man                   
-like thriller, as Jones secures a journalist's visa to Russia to discover the truth about the USSR's economic expansion. The film burrows into the time just before the horrors of the gulag became known, when Stalin was thought to be a good egg by one and all, and this normalisation may be the film's most salutary lesson for today's audiences.
Befriended by another British journalist, Ada Brooks (Vanessa Kirby), who refers to the KGB man following her as her "big brother", Jones travels to Ukraine and ducks his government-appointed minders to check out the conditions for himself. There the movie changes gear, and almost genre, for its portrayal of what greets him: a wintry landscape of death and starvation in desolate eastern Ukraine, where infants bawl unattended, people step around corpses lying where they fall in the street, and - in the movie's most shocking sequence - children feast on unidentified meat. Shedding noirish camera angles and Eisensteinian montage for a haunting, handheld aesthetic - it feels like a sudden dose of Tarkovsky in the middle of a thriller - Tomasz Naumiuk's cinematography fills the widescreen frame and packs a humanitarian punch that the film never again matches.
The more it strays towards the territory of a traditional biopic, the less successful it is. Jones and Orwell never met in person, but the screenwriter Andrea Chalupa imagines a lunch between the two men. "I have a story, but if I tell it, six innocent men will die," Jones says. Thus, we are to understand, was the germ of 
                   Animal Farm                   
 born - a slight exaggeration, but not much - as Orwell began to slip away from sympathy for the Kremlin's "great experiment".
I could have done without the shots of Orwell clattering away at his typewriter, but Norton gives a deeply sympathetic performance as the young, idealistic Jones, trying to expose the original fake news; Peter Sarsgaard is slithery as the Pulitzer-winning writer Walter Duranty, a slinky sybarite whose louche parties leave Norton's glasses steamed; and Kirby delivers another dose of agonised romantic ambivalence. (Someone cast her in a Graham Greene adaptation, soon.) But the star here is the 71-year-old Holland, whose directing career, after a stint directing TV for HBO, feels newly resurgent and relevant.

Nov 27, 2019( International Business Times News: http://www.ibtimes.com Delivered by Newstex)  Foreign films don't often receiveas much attention as big-budgeteddomestic blockbusters, let alone horror thrillers. Riding the coattails of last year's'Roma,' which walked away with a Foreign Feature nod, the South Korean hit 'Parasite' evokes similar praise and could become a Best Picture nominee, too.Known in its native language as 'Gisaengchung,' Bong Joon-Ho's 'Parasite' opened with some stellar reviews, so much so that The Hollywood Reporter[1] now claims it ranks high among the Best Picture contenders. 
Since its release, 'Parasite' has grossed $112 million worldwide and even won Cannes Film Festival's Palmer d'Or.The plot of 'Parasite' isa subtle look atthe differences inclass between that of a family living in poverty and afar more fortunate one. The story follows the impoverished family's son as he teaches English to the wealthier family's daughter. As the heart-pounding mystery of 'Parasite' unfolds, the more asequestered tension ramps up, drawing both families together for better and worse.In definingthe'Parasite' Oscar buzz, Variety's[2] Brent Lang and Claudia Eller write,'It's partly attributable to the way the movie's subversive portrait of class tensions resonates at a time when economic inequality has become a dominant political issue.'The Oscars are one weighty race. The first-ever foreign film to be nominated asBest Picture was Jean Renoir's 'The Grand Illusion' from 1938. Since then, only nine other foreign movies have made the Oscar's Best Picture cut, that being merely nominated. None have ever won.Thus far, though, it seems that 'Parasite' is on many pundits' radars. According to sources from THR, not only are a variety of Hollywood insidersdiscussing the film but nomination ballots are already being recorded with 'Parasite' at the top of the list. Says one insider: ''Roma' was a beautiful film, but it never had that 'Oh my God!' feeling. 'Parasite' is a passion vote.'A multitude of likewise belovedfilms have alsomade Best Picture buzz this year, reported via THR[3]. The list includes massive blockbusters, like 'Avengers: Endgame' and 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' as well as star-studded hits like 'The Lighthouse' and 'Jojo Rabbit.' It's a contentious battle, though many still consider 'Parasite' to be at the forefront of them all. Oscars statues are pictured on March 4, 2018, in Hollywood, California.

The ceremony is on Feb. 9. Here’s a complete rundown of where to find nominees that are streaming, with links to our original reviews.

Quentin Tarantino’s evocation of 1969 Los Angeles clings to an era it doesn’t want to end, even if it has to rewrite history a little to do it. With the story of a fading western star (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his trusty stunt double (Brad Pitt), Tarantino accesses the period through a side door, allowing him the space to cruise top-down through the streets, hang out on Hollywood sound stages and follow the actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) in the blissful days before the Manson family goes to Cielo Drive.

Nominated for: Best picture, director, original screenplay, international feature, editing and production design.
How to watch: Rent it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu and            Google Play.
A family of penniless con artists infiltrates the lives of a much wealthier family in Bong Joon Ho’s genre-straddling mix of dark comedy, nerve-jangling suspense and incisive social commentary. The less known about the intricacies of the plot going in, the better, since Bong has nested the many twists so meticulously. But as the two families grow more closely intertwined, their fates are tied up in duplicity, an uneasy tension between classes and one very big secret that’s primed to detonate.

‘The Irishman’
[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]
Nominated for: Best picture, director, adapted screenplay, supporting actor (twice), cinematography, costume design, editing, production design and visual effects.
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Based on Charles Brandt’s book “I Heard You Paint Houses,” the movie is about Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), who claims to have worked as a hit man for the Bufalino crime family, and to have been responsible for the unsolved disappearance of the former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). Yet the dubious facts of Sheeran’s “confession” are folded into a uniquely meditative Martin Scorsese gangster epic, which slows the metabolism of films like “Goodfellas” and “Casino” to reflect on death and the consequences of a sinful life.

‘Joker’
[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]
Nominated for: Best picture, director, actor, adapted screenplay, cinematography, editing, costume design, makeup and hairstyling, original score, sound editing, and sound mixing.
How to watch: Rent it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
Standing in stark contrast to the bright, can-do heroism of the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and going down a darker road than even its DC brethren, like the Christopher Nolan “Batman” series — “Joker” frames a villain’s origins as a grimy tale of urban alienation. As Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian who lives with his mother, Joaquin Phoenix more or less slaps clown makeup on Travis Bickle from “Taxi Driver,” though the director Todd Phillips lays some of the blame for Fleck’s psychosis on a broken social system.

‘Marriage Story’
[Video:  Watch on YouTube.]
Nominated for: Best picture, original screenplay, actor, actress, supporting actress and original score.
How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Thirty years after “Kramer vs. Kramer” won best picture, the writer-director Noah Baumbach gets into the excruciating particulars of divorce, especially when child custody is at stake. Adam Driver stars as a New York theater director who’s left reeling when his wife (Scarlett Johansson), an actress trying to resume her Hollywood career, hires a skilled attorney (Laura Dern) and works to resettle their 8-year-old son in Los Angeles. The process gets uglier from there, but Baumbach cushions the blows with humor and sneaky optimism.
