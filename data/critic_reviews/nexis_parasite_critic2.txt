SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - South Koreans are reveling in writer-director Bong Joon Ho's dark comic thriller, "Parasite," which won this year's Academy Awards for best film and best international feature. The movie itself, however, doesn't put the country in a particularly positive light.
No doubt, the international acclaim for "Parasite," which also won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, highlights South Korea's emergence as a global cultural power, a reflection of decades of focus on building world-class industries in one of the most vibrant democracies in Asia.
But it also hints at an uncomfortable truth: While the national successes have been spectacular - from Samsung's rise as a global economic powerhouse to the explosion of K-pop in Asia and beyond - many South Koreans recognize that there's been a dark side to that rise. Only a few years ago, Bong himself was blacklisted by the government, and the characters in his film reflect a society where many feel intense hopelessness.
South Korea's rapid emergence from the devastation of the 1950-53 Korean War also saw a bloody transition from dictatorship to democracy. Its association with neat smartphones and cars came amid a constant threat from nuclear North Korea. For every international success, there's also widespread worry that South Korea will forever be overshadowed by regional giants Russia, China and Japan.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who frequently praises mega-popular K-pop boy band BTS, tweeted that he's grateful to Bong for "giving courage and pride to our people overcoming difficulties."
But "Parasite"'s main characters portray South Koreans who have been left behind by the country's dramatic changes. It's a biting commentary on deepening inequality and other problems that have many young and poor people describing their lives as a hellish nightmare.
South Korea has one of the largest gaps between rich and poor among developed nations and is struggling mightily to deal with decaying job markets, rocketing house prices and a record-low birth rate as couples put off having babies while struggling with low pay and harsh work conditions.
Although fully Korean in language, humor and tone, Bong's dark tale of poverty and class struggle resonates across borders because Western democracies are also experiencing similar social and economic problems, albeit not as "extreme" as in South Korea, according to Chin Jung-kwon, a prominent cultural critic.
"The film shows that South Korea still has a strong message to show the world," Chin said.
While Bong is uniquely talented as a director, it was only a matter of time before South Korean movies and other pop cultural products gained increasing acceptance in the West, considering South Korea's dynamic cultural scene, which has matured along with its democracy, Chin says.
K-pop has garnered a huge international following with an increasing number of fans coming from the United States.
With "Map of the Soul: Persona," BTS last year became the first musicians since the Beatles to debut three consecutive albums atop the Billboard Album chart in a span of less than a year. South Korean TV dramas, which triggered the original "Korean Wave" in the early 2000s, continue to be big in Asia and other regions like the Middle East.
Perhaps more than any other genre, South Korean films have aggressively tested artistic boundaries, often with stunning visuals and violence meant to expose the underside of the country's economic success story.
This sometimes creates political consequences for the artists.
Bong was one of thousands of artists who were blacklisted and denied government funds under the rule of conservative former President Park Geun-hye for their allegedly critical views of her administration. Following protests by millions, Park was ousted from office in March 2017 and is now serving a decades-long prison term for corruption.
Not everyone was happy about how Bong portrayed the characters in "Parasite," which tells the story of how an unemployed family of four living in a slum basement apartment comically con their way into the lives one of Seoul's wealthiest families before things begin to unravel darkly.
Critic Kim Gyu-hang accused Bong of objectifying poor people and treating their lives like a "sightseeing attraction," saying that the film makes no real attempt at explaining how the system locked the characters in a desperately hopeless situation.
"("Parasite") provides no deep insight into humans, their anger and how they are a byproduct of the social system that surrounds them," Kim said.
"Parasite"'s Oscars success follows years of struggles by South Korean directors to break through in Hollywood. Park Chan-wook, who won the Grand Prix at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival with his thriller "Oldboy," received mixed reviews for his 2013 work "Stoker," an English-language thriller starring Nicole Kidman. Bong enjoyed both commercial and critical success with his 2013 sci-fi film "Snowpiercer," which starred Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton along with "Parasite" actor Song Kang-ho.
But nothing that's come before has been remotely as successful as this South Korean film shot in the Korean language.
"Every society in the world experiences conflicts created by people's efforts to move up the class ladder, and South Korean films have dealt with this issue for a long time," said veteran filmmaker Lee Jang-ho. "Maybe Bong's dark humor and his vivid description of the lives of the South Korean poor, including their 'half-basement' living spaces, felt refreshing to American moviegoers."

REVIEW: 'Parasite' shocks and thrills with a piercing look at Korean class

Well, I can now confidently declare the first lock for an Oscar win this year - Director Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite" for Best Foreign Language Film. 
There have been many award-worthy films, such as "Jojo Rabbit" and "Ford v Ferrari," to come out over the past couple months, but none of them have been quite as mesmerizing and utterly shocking as Joon Ho's "Parasite." The South Korean director, who has developed his name and brand with peculiar films such as 2013's "Snowpiercer" and 2017's "Okja," has crafted "Parasite," a film unlike any other you'll see this year. It's disturbing, it's funny, it's thrilling and it's a truly spellbinding work of art. 
It's also frustratingly difficult to talk about.
What makes it difficult to discuss is how scattered and truly bizarre the plot of the movie is. Set in modern-day South Korea, "Parasite" highlights the extreme contrasts in the standard of living and mental health between the upper and lower classes. There are constantly new developments and unexpected twists being thrown at the audience. However, instead of leading into a needlessly confusing maze of plot points, they all miraculously work together to make the film even more compelling with every turn. However, because of all of these different twists, it's basically impossible to explain what the movie is about without delving into spoilers. And trust me, you do not, under any condition, want this movie spoiled for you. 
Prior to "Parasite" I had only seen two of Joon Ho's films - the aforementioned "Snowpiercer" and "Okja." While I found "Snowpiercer" to be a thrilling experience, "Okja" was a little too goofy in my opinion. Despite my differing opinions on those films, the one constant was the raw talent and intensity of Joon Ho's filmmaking. In "Parasite," Joon Ho shows not just that he's talented, but that he has the potential to be one of the most brilliantly idiosyncratic filmmakers in the industry. 
From beginning to end, "Parasite" is constantly shifting and morphing through distinctive tones and moods. At times, it feels like a comedy that explores the silly social antics of people from different backgrounds. On the other hand, there are disturbingly ominous and foreboding moments of the film that will make viewers squirm in their seats. Sometimes, Joon Ho will transition between tones so subtly that the audience barely even notices what's happening. Other times, violently jarring transitions suddenly throw viewers into a vastly different situation. 
"Parasite" uses these offbeat tones to trick the audience into jumping to false conclusions about what the film is about. It will seemingly be setting up one direction or story arc before flipping the entire story on its head and going down an alternate path that leads the audience further into its trap. It almost feels like "Parasite" is playing games with its viewers - taunting them with different expectations - only to reveal something entirely new and unforeseen. Joon Ho is consistently subverting the audience's expectations, which makes "Parasite" one of the most unpredictable, unconventional and unsuspectingly sensational films I've seen in a long while. 
"Parasite" will get Oscar nominations, it's just a question of how many. It's a shoe-in to win Best Foreign Language Film, and it will undoubtedly get a Best Picture nomination. Whether or not it will win the top-prize is still to be seen, but I would say you should run out and experience this movie as soon as possible, not only to be thrilled by the glory of Joon Ho's filmmaking, but to become prepared to discuss it again come awards season.

Man, the new movie by the guy who directed Snowpiercer is really picking up steam!
...get it? Picking up steam? Because it's from the same director who did Snowpiercer? The movie about the train that never stops? Get it?
Ah, never mind...
If I had to guess, I'd say that Parasite is a very different kind of movie than what most 'Murican audiences will be used to from Bong Joon-ho. While he's done drama before - Barking Dogs Never Bite and Mother - over here, his most popular films are his genre pieces. Films like The Host, his take on Godzilla, Okja, which is more fantasy than anything, or the aforementioned Snowpiercer, which is all about a magical train that goes around and around the world, forever and ever...suffice it to say, I can easily imagine a scenario where someone goes into a movie called Parasite, knowing it's by the guy who made all those films, expecting another dip into sci-fi and horror, and getting what appears to be a straight-up drama instead. There are parasites in this movie...but they're all very human.
Parasite has to do with a downtrodden, out-of-work family of four. We see in the opening scene that they in such squalor that, when a fumigation crew starts dusting the street outside, they decide to leave the window open to get rid of their roach problem. For free! Things take an interesting turn, however, when a friend of Ki-woo - the son in the family - asks him to fill in as a tutor to the daughter of a rich family. Ki-woo obliges, but soon into his first day he senses an opening for his sister, Ki-jeong, to join him as an art tutor for the rich son. Never mind that she doesn't know the first thing about art, and doesn't have any credentials; nothing a bit of light forgery can't fix. Once she's there, though, she starts looking for positions for her parents. The other jobs around the household are already taken by other people, but if something were to happen to them...
Doesn't sound much like Snowpiercer, does it? But make no mistake; Parasite comes from the same mind. For one thing, despite all appearances, it's very fluid, genre-wise. It defies simple characterization, which I always like (I'm generally of the opinion that genre restrictions are stupid). It begins as a satire, before hardening into straight drama, then back into comedy, before elements of horror start to creep in, and then...I'd better not say. But Bong Joon-ho is always in complete control; I never felt that he was just throwing whatever he wanted at the wall, and seeing what stuck. There was a purpose to the tonal shifts, and the end result was a film experience that I couldn't predict the end of, or even the next scene of.
But the main clue that this is a Bong Joon-ho picture is the recurring theme of class warfare. I'm bringing up Snowpiercer a lot in this review, and there's a reason for that, beyond the fact that I love it. Snowpiercer isn't just a movie about a train endlessly circling a desolate, frozen earth; it's a movie about the way the train divides its passengers into different cars based on their wealth and social status, and the eventual armed revolution by the have-nots against the haves.
Parasite isn't as fantastical as Snowpiercer, or even Okja, but it absolutely deals with the same themes. Weirdly, Parasite serves as a kind of spiritual relative to Jordan Peele's Us from earlier this year. They're both comedy-drama-horror hybrids that start out as one thing, before slowly transitioning into a parable about the lengths the disenfranchised will go, not only to survive, but to get back what they think they're owed. There's something almost supernatural about the way the family systematically attaches themselves to the rich family; watching them at work, they almost could be seen as the tethered.
It works, though, for two main reasons. The first, it's never moralistic, or heavy-handed. The themes are right there, but you do have to work for them. The social satire of the movie mostly comes up through contrast; for instance, when there's a downpour about midway through the movie, the poor family (I refer to them as such because we never get any last names) has to worry about their little hovel flooding. The rich family, by contrast, spend the whole day post-flood commenting on how lovely their wet grass looks, which irritates the poor family to no end. 
The second reason is much simpler; it's just wildly entertaining. There are sequences so brilliantly put together, the audience I saw this with was simultaneously screaming and in stitches. This is a prime example of a film that deals with heady subjects dead on, while still maintaining a high entertainment value.

Parasite review - a gasp-inducing masterpiece; A poor but united family bluff their way into the lives of a wealthy Seoul household in Bong Joon-ho's flawless tragicomedy

Star Rating: 5 stars
The ideal way to experience South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho's awards-garlanded, international box-office smash is with as little prior knowledge as possible. So if you're reading this before seeing the film, and you've managed to avoid the whirlwind of publicity it has attracted since winning the Palme d'Or last May, it may be simpler to just stop and head straight to the cinema. Because, at the risk of adding to the hype,            Parasite really is the kind of remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going such a joy. I saw it for the fourth time last week and I'm now desperate to view the            black-and-white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival.
Described by its creator as "a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains", Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian - a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong's back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), in their lowly semi-basement home, hunting for stray wifi coverage and leaving their windows open to benefit from bug-killing street fumigation. They have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family.
An architectural wonder perched high above the slums of Seoul, with views not of urinating drunks but of luxurious lawns and starlit skies, this wealthy house is everything the Kims' pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. It's a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), who stayed with the building after its original architect owner moved out. Spying an opening, Ki-woo (newly dubbed "Kevin") realises that his own family could easily fill such roles, and hatches a plan that will inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks.
Beyond the deliberate ambiguity of the title (which, like Jordan Peele's oddly comparable Us, cuts both ways), Bong once again foregrounds a distrust of wealth and authority that has been a recurrent feature of his work since his 2003 breakout Memories of Murder, continuing through films as diverse as The Host, Mother, Okja and, of course,            Snowpiercer, to which Parasite contains several knowing nods.
The Kim family may live in sewage-flooded squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of "people who ride the subway". Similarly, while the smug Mr Park is habitually depicted ascending the stairs of his ultra-modern home, and the Kims are pictured scampering down city steps to their own underworld apartment, it's clear who holds the dramatic high ground.
When it comes to deception, too, those on the upper rungs of the societal ladder are as practised as those upon whom they look down. In a world of vertical non-integration, Parasite finds gasp-inducing depths lurking beneath even the most apparently placid surfaces. Yet Bong is careful to keep his opposing forces keenly balanced, creating the cinematic equivalent of a Rorschach inkblot test in which the audience is invited to decide for themselves the precise meaning of these strangely symmetrical apparitions.
Perfectly accompanying the film's tonal shifts is Jung Jae-il's magnificently modulated music, which moves from the sombre piano patterns of the curtain-raiser, through the mini symphony of The Belt of Faith to the cracked craziness of cues in which choric vocals do battle with a musical saw. Just as the action can segue from slapstick to horror and back - sometimes within the space of a single scene - so Jung plays things straight even as madness beckons, ensuring that the underlying elements of pathos are amplified rather than undercut by pastiche.
For me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multitonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul.

Jan 15, 2020( 411mania.com: http://411mania.com Delivered by Newstex)  I mentioned recently[1] that I really wanted to see Parasite, but knew little about it going in. I thought it was for the best that I keep it that way and try to see the movie as soon as possible to see what all the buzz was about.I'm glad I did. Bong Joon-Ho's 2019 movie about class and desperation is a lot of different things at once. It's partially a comedy. 
It has aspects of being a thriller. It is dramatic and thoughtful. Parasite shifts as it treks along and continually leaves you guessing as to what is next, and knowing just some cursory data made the ride with it all the better. If at all possible, see this movie without going in with too much information. (And in the interest of that, I'll remain spoiler-free until I give a warning that they are forthcoming) The story is of a South Korean family-the Kims (Kang-Ho Song as patriarch Ki-Taek, So-Dam Park as Ki-jung, Woo-Sik Choi as Ki-woo, and Hye-Jin Jang as the mother, Chung-sook)-who are living in abject poverty, folding pizza boxes (poorly!) for a meager living. Bums routinely pee in the street right outside their window, their wi-fi and cell phones have been shut off, and stinkbugs and cockroaches are claiming their home for themselves. When Ki-Woo's friend offers to get him a lucrative job tutoring a sophomore who comes from a wealthy family, his whole family becomes possessed of greed. Through a chain of deception, all of the Kims get hired as various employees of the Park family, even when they have to get long-standing staff fired to do so.From there things happen. I can't give it away (yet)! At one point, my wife turned to me and asked, 'Are these good people?' in regards to the Kims. It's a good question. They are duplicitous and show only brief and minor self-reflection at their own activities. Still, they don't quite seem as nefarious as they do desperate and needy. They are certainly greedy and short-sighted, sure, but when presented with an opportunity to improve their station in life, all they know is that they have to. So are they 'good' people? No. Then are they 'bad'? Also no. They just seem realistic and pitiable, and both the script and the actors themselves are brilliant in keeping these characters in their lane and not leaning into becoming one-dimensional. It's helped by the fact that, as con people should be, the Kims are entirely charming and likable in spite of what their deceit. And Bong Joon-Ho's screenplay is so much fun with its mood shifts. They movie flows from making you laugh to having you grip your armrest with seamless grace. And even in its most intense moments, it can find a way to make you laugh again (mirrored in the fate of one of the characters). Parasite creates a cornucopia of feelings inside its viewer as it goes, and I really enjoyed it. I will attest to a few things: Mostly in that the ending is something of a letdown. Even if it does bring everything full circle to a degree. So if you haven't seen it, do so. It's not flawless, but it's great fun, and the acting is unimpeachable. (As a side note apropos of nothing, my favorite moment of the movie might have been when my wife, who clearly thought this was going to be something else entirely, turned to me after about 30 minutes and asked 'Where the hell are the zombies at?') So are we ready for SPOILERS?So having known that the film had a bit of a thriller aspect to it, I was expecting that the ultimate storyline would be that the Parks were always aware of the Kims' machinations and would eventually turn on the family somehow. That isn't even close. The Parks are as aloof and oblivious as the movie portrays them. Instead, the movie turns when the Parks are away for a camping trip and the Kims claim the house for themselves. While partying into the night, the former housekeeper that was fired in their wake shows up and reveals that her husband has been living in a secret shelter under the house for years to avoid debt collection. Ha! Didn't see that coming! Just when things are looking EVEN BETTER for the Kims-the housekeeper offers them a monthly bribe to keep the secret resident cared for-they (literally) slip up and reveal themselves. With the Parks calling to announce they are returning early, the movie descends into a mad dash as the Kims try to subdue their surprise guests, remove any sign of their own mess, and make the Parks dinner for their arrival. It's all delightfully frantic while also gloriously intense. Characters fall into a pile of bodies to wrestle away a cell phone with an incriminating video, brawl to restrain each other in the basement, shove debris under a table, and make ram-don. It's the juxtaposition of the latter two normally mundane activities against the much more dire former ones that sells the scene because it ALL feels important. While these characters are literally fighting each other to protect their various secrets, you as a viewer are left screaming in your head, 'They're eight minutes away! Clean up the chips you were eating!' With the Parks back home, the movie remains both humorously zany and white-knuckling intense while the Kims try to escape the home with the homeowners settling in after their aborted trip. The movie showcases how much success simple visuals can have when Ki-Taek snake-crawls his way out from under a table and then comes to a dead stop when the homeowners wake up. A great combination of 'acting' and cinematography for another moment that shouldn't work on as many levels as it does. The climax of the movie turns to tragedy when everything goes wrong for everyone, honestly. While the Park couple has been relatively sin free all movie, we see that they don't care at all about their 'help' when Ki-Jung is bleeding to death on their lawn, and their lack of concern finally breaks Ki-Taek, causing him to stab his employer to death and flee the scene.The turns and shifts that Parasite takes really shouldn't work, but the direction and the work put in by the cast just sell everything. When Ki-woo wakes up after suffering a pretty severe head trauma, he finds he can't stop laughing even when faced with awful situations not unlike how the film has made you chuckle throughout even when the stakes have been high. Even the parts of the movie I didn't think needed to be there ultimately work if you think about them. Ki-woo's relationship with Da-Hye-the daughter of the Parks-feels like it is extraneous, but it works when you see him carrying around the rock that his friend Min gave to him earlier in the film. Min also gave him the job with The Parks and noted he trusted Ki-woo not to lust after Da-Hye. Ki-woo then carries the rock as the symbol of the guilt that is weighing him down. It seems obvious in hindsight, but it took some reconsideration to see how it all fit. Likewise, Ki-woo fast-talking his way into a job interview at the pizza restaurant doesn't go anywhere, but it establishes how quick-witted and opportunistic he is for when he meets Mrs. Park and almost immediately gets Ki-Jung an interview with the family. It's character building 101, but done sneakily enough that it caught me later when I was putting together the pieces. This is a movie I initially liked, but the more I think about it, I might kind of love. It has already gone from 'That was fun and weird' to 'That was pretty well-layered and purposeful'. I gotta quit writing off movies with subtitles because I am lazy, man.

'Parasite': insightful critique of wealth, celebrity privacy

The Oscar-winning movie "Parasite," by filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho is well worth its raving reviews and remains, in my mind, a phenomenal movie. Its subject matter cuts right to the heart of the economic class division in South Korea, in a way that appeals universally to income disparity worldwide.
I honestly feel bad for those who are wealthy and affluent. And, I feel only pity for the rich and famous. Because you lose something when you reach your dreams and live on top of the mountain of your achievement; this separates a person from what it is like to actually live. Failure gains a new connotation when it is no longer synonymous with homelessness or poverty, as wealth becomes a safety net to correct mistakes.
Not to say that money is a bad thing - far from it. Money is necessary for exactly this reason, beyond meeting our basic needs money frees us to live fuller lives, pursuing individual interests. But money has a price to itself as well, in that extreme realm of the celebrity where privilege is lost for privacy.
In our reality, there are things a celebrity will never have. The chance to walk down the street, go to the store. Ride a bike, even be in a public place. Funny, that our most public figures can't use public spaces. If they did, they'd be mobbed by fans for pictures or autographs. The phenomenon is like a reply to the old retort, "This is why we can't have nice things." That when a thing becomes available to everyone is precisely when someone will come along to break it. Hence, we break the people we follow.
So a celebrity will never have that love of a stranger meeting a stranger and talking of something inconsequential. The weather, an object of curiosity in the surrounding, only that it be something besides themselves. Having a world not interested in them, because once fame digs its fangs in, there is no going back beyond losing exactly what it has bitten.
And so celebrities will continue to pay more and more to give themselves the security that they lost in their anonymity. Ironic, that the more influential a person becomes the more they have to spend to put a facade over the fact. Money, what comes with fame and success, becomes a necessary commodity to maintain a barrier between the celebrity and the pedestrian. Similarly, an economic line is drawn when this occurs, one that distinguishes the wealthy individual from the lower class. Hence, a type of elitism is born.
As part of this elitism, the ultra-rich are no longer able to interact with others in a peer-to-peer environment. A celebrity loses that similar connection that can come from people with a similar history or background. As Chung-sook says in "Parasite": "Rich people are naive, no resentments. No creases on them. It all gets ironed out.
Money is an iron." With the increasing gap between the rich and poor in South Korea and other nations abroad, the wealthy class disconnects from its poverty-stricken, lower-class neighbors.
With wealth you don't need to be nice - you can be a pretentious and arrogant and people will still love you for your money. And yet for the wealthy people who are nice, I can only think of the freedom that money gave them to be that way. A "plan B," where if they were faced with tragedy they could still grin and bear it for remaining financially unaffected by the loss.
Nobody plans for complications or stumbling blocks, and yet they happen. Misfortune can happen at any time - storms, earthquakes or floods. In natural disasters alone, without a financial safety net, the lives of the people affected by these events are devastated. Imagine: a man has a heart attack at the wheel of a car and smashes into an oncoming car. If you're the oncoming car, how can you plan for that event? You can't, and so the only argument that holds sway is to say that nothing matters. In the words of the impoverished father in "Parasite," Ki-taek, "With no plan, nothing can go wrong. And if something spins out of control, it doesn't matter."
At this point, the film industry as a whole leaves me feeling jaded. Between the viewers who become obsessed with artists and their work, and the wealthy class of individuals that cannot blend into that viewership for their cult-like following, it paints a crass picture of the economic disparity on both ends.
Simultaneously, Allegheny College sponsored a concert featuring Bryce Vine for its student population this month, to rousing student applause and widespread community approval. In our upper-class climate, it's seen as money well spent.

Cannes Palme d'Or goes to Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite'

Filmmaker Bong Joon-ho on Saturday became the first South Korean to win the Cannes Film Festival's prestigious top prize, the Palme d'Or, with his film 'Parasite.'
The tragicomic film explores the growing gap between rich and poor by telling the story of two families at opposite ends of the economic spectrum in South Korea.
"The film is laugh-out-loud funny, an astute blend of humanity and absurdity, thrilling until its final depraved moments, a pristinely-shot modern architectural feast for the eyes, a razor-sharp socioeconomic critique, and a cryptic operatic drama," wrote filmmaking news site Film School Rejects in a review.
For many critics, the choice for the top prize among the 21 contenders was especially difficult at the world's most influential international film festival.
Some believed Sciamma would win it, making her only the second female to do so in the prize's history. Others thought Spanish heavyweight Pedro Almodovar would pick it up with his most personal film to date, 'Dolor y gloria.'
Bong is best known for his dramatic films 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja.'
An icon of American independent cinema, Jim Jarmusch, opened the festival on May 14. With his new film, 'The Dead Don't Die,' the director presented a not-so-serious zombie movie that targets Donald Trump's America. Bill Murray and Adam Driver play an offbeat cop team, dealing with lots of bloody undead. Tilda Swinton and Danny Glover, as well as music veterans Iggy Pop and Tom Waits, are also in the satirical horror flick. With so many big names, it was a busy premiere on the red carpet, but critics complained about the film's lack of direction.
Only a few days before the beginning of the festival, the organisers were excited to announce the long-awaited film by star director Quentin Tarantino. His new movie, 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,' was finished in the nick of time — allowing his return to Cannes 25 years after Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or. Leonardo DiCaprio (pictured above in a still from the film), Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie star in the drama set in the late 1960s as the hippie movement and Manson Family nightmare gripped Hollywood.
Tarantino's 10th film, said to be his final one, was the hottest red-carpet event of the festival. The movie itself mostly obtained positive reviews, but it's also a divisive work: for instance, the German judge on the reputed Screen Daily jury didn't feel it was worth a single star.
Along with Jarmusch and Tarantino, 19 more filmmakers are competing for the top Golden Palm prize awarded on Saturday, May 25.
Antonio Banderas, winner of the Best Actor award
Among these were star filmmakers like Spain's master director, Almodovar, who presented a new melodrama, Pain and Glory ('Dolor y gloria'). Starring perennial collaborators Penelope Cruz and Antonio Banderas, the work is seen as one of the filmmaker's best in years and ranks high among the competition's frontrunners.
'Young Ahmed,' a film by Belgian brothers and two-time Palme d'Or winners, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, is a timely portrait of the radicalisation of a young Muslim teen, but the film failed to completely convince critics.
From Great Britain, veteran Ken Loach — another one of the nine filmmakers who have won the Palme d'Or twice to date — returned to the festival with his latest working-class drama, 'Sorry We Missed You.'
The United States was represented by Terrence Malick, who won Cannes' top award in 2011 with 'The Tree of Life.' His much-praised 'A Hidden Life' is based on the true story of an Austrian man who chose to resist the Nazis.
Canadian prodigy Xavier Dolan premiered his new romantic drama, 'Matthias & Maxime,' which obtained generally positive reviews however without landing among the favourites.
French director Abdellatif Kechiche ('Blue is the Warmest Color') screened his sequel to 'Mektoub My Love' on Thursday. But it's a lesser-known director from that country who reaped the most buzz during the festival: Celine Sciamma's enigmatic drama 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' is among the top Palm d'Or contenders.
Another French director, Ladj Ly, also garnered strong praise for his debut feature film, 'Les Miserables,' about rebellion in the notorious suburbs of Paris.
South Korea's preeminent auteur Bong Joon-ho's creepy 'Parasite' is also among the top contenders, the film having received a standing ovation that was almost as long as the one given to Tarantino's film.
China's Diao Yina's crime noir 'The Wild Goose Lake' also garnered positive festival buzz.
Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu was the head of a prominent jury this year, with fellow judges including actresses Elle Fanning (US) and Maimouna N'Diaye (Burkina Faso), as well as a host of directing celebrities: Alice Rohrwacher (Italy), Enki Bilal and Robin Campillo from France, Kelly Reichardt (US) and Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos.
Cannes, too, has special series where all new developments in the world of film are put on display — even those which aren't competing for the main awards.
The most talked-about world premiere was the sequin-loaded Elton John biopic, 'Rocketman.'
A new film by Claude Lelouch, 'Les plus belles annees d'une vie,' with legendary actors Anouk Aimee and Jean-Louis Trintignant, was also screened at the festival.
Last but not least, films by prominent directors such as Bruno Dumont and Christophe Honore were shown in the secondary section called Un Certain Regard.
Each year, the honorary award of the festival goes to a worthy actor or actress with years of success behind them. This year, it went to iconic French actor Alain Delon. Born in 1935, the actor has worked in cinema since the late 1950s, having appeared in over 80 films. Considered one of the greatest actors of European cinema, his biggest successes include films like 'Purple Noon,' 'Le Samourai' and 'The Leopard.'
However, the award attracted controversy this year, with the "Women and Hollywood" group saying that honouring a man who has admitted to hitting women "sucks."
In recent years, the festival has become a pioneer in the fight against the rise of the Netflix streaming model for films.
In contrast to the festivals in Berlin and Venice, Cannes does not show any productions in the competition which do not run in theatres. Cannes sees this as a statement of solidarity with cinemas, which means new films by star directors like Martin Scorsese or Steven Soderbergh have not been invited to participate.
This year, the competition line-up only featured four films by female directors. "In the Men's Club of Cannes, this could be described as progress," mocked the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. Indeed, there have been even fewer female directors in recent Cannes competitions. Apart from Austrian Jessica Hausner, three French directors, Mati Diop, Celine Sciamma, and Justine Triet, were selected in this year's race for the Palm d'Or.
Closing the festival is a film by successful directing duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, 'Hors Normes' (The Specials), screened out of competition on Saturday. It is likely to be met with great interest.
Telling the story of an autistic youth, the comedy features acting greats such as Vincent Cassel and Reda Kateb, and plenty of fresh talent. The directors' biggest hit was 'Untouchable' in 2011, while their lively wedding film 'C'est la Vie!' was released two years ago.
The winners of this 72nd Festival appeared before the press at the end of the Closing Ceremony to express their joy in having been awarded the prizes. A brief overview of the best moments.
Bong Joon-Ho, winner of the Palme d'or for 'Gisaengchung' (Parasite):
At a press conference, I said that I was drawing in this film on a form of humour specific to South Korea. I was sure that not all spectators would understand, but I'm happy to see I was wrong. That's because this film is about a family story. I mix genres, it's my style, and that's why I'm even happier to win this award. My influences for this film are Hitchcock, Chabrol, but also Im Sang-soo, who directed 'Hanyo' (The Housemaid). I don't think I'm the only Korean director with the ability to win such an award. I would like to be able to organise retrospectives to shine a spotlight on Korean cinema.
Mati Diop, winner of the Grand Prix with 'Atlantique' (Atlantics):
I was overwhelmed by the situation. Seeing all the world's cinema greats in front of you and receiving this award is something else. This film goes way back. I've been carrying it within me for a long time. The subject is ambitious, it talks about a situation that seemed important to me and I wanted to talk about it. I was very surprised by the way it aroused people's emotions. I could feel how it affected them. It's a relief, a great opportunity. The shooting was very connected to reality, to the streets of Dakar. Unconsciously, I wanted to keep the documentary spirit of this film.
Ladj Ly, winner of the Jury Prize (tied) with 'Les Misérables':
I'm very happy and proud. It's been an incredible adventure. We had been trying to edit this film for ten years. It was not easy to get funding. We had to fight for this and that's why we're happy. We have been "yellow jackets" in the suburbs for 20 years, claiming our rights and being subjected to police violence. The causes are the same, our struggle is the same.
Emily Beecham, winner of the Best Actress award for her role in 'Little Joe,' by Jessica Hausner:
I had no idea what was going to happen when I walked up the stairs tonight. And then I was overwhelmed with emotions because it's my first prize. What I had to do for this role was challenging. As an actress, I had to be as open as possible. There's something blocked in the character I played. We were very precise in the choreography of the shooting. We kept to a certain rhythm with the camera.
Antonio Banderas, winner of the Best Actor award for his role in 'Dolor y gloria' (Pain and Glory) by Pedro Almodóvar:
It's an incredibly unique thing for me. I've been nominated for almost all the awards except the Oscars, but I never got to go up on stage. My cardiologist must have been stressed out sitting in front of his screen! Almodóvar? He is my mentor, I respect him a great deal. I wish he was here today. I thank him for these forty years of career and the eight films we made together.
Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles, winners of the Jury award (tied) with 'Bacurau':
It's slowly beginning to dawn on us that this film, which has been in the making for ten years, has received an award. It is a real honour. Especially since in Brazil, culture is managed by sad white men. We will continue to keep in direct touch with Brazilian reality. We are pleased that the film has been recognised as a genre film. Cinema in Brazil will be subject to severe budget cuts. This award comes at an important time when Brazilian cinema is being destroyed from the inside.
César Diaz, winner of the Caméra d'Or with 'Nuestras Madres' (Our Mothers):
Given the subject of the film, I needed to film while holding back. It was difficult because I was coming to the end of a process. We had a historical responsibility around this subject so we took great care over it. We had to create space for the spectator's emotions.
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, winners of the Best Director Award for 'Le Jeune Ahmed' (Young Ahmed):
We never won this award before. We've dreamed about it. Directing is at the heart of the work we do. Cinema films life, the quivering of things, the little things that move and the movements of the body. We owe a great deal to our actor Idir Ben Addi. He has an innate sense of rhythm and rhythm is very important when it comes to directing. He had a lot of fun on the set. We shot an arrow, and Idir was that arrow, that we so obstinately tried to film. An actor is always a third, fourth, fifth director. Directing is about finding out how to live the inside of a character.
Céline Sciamma, winner of the Best Screenplay prize with 'Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu' (Portrait of a Lady on Fire):
It's been an exceptional year. The selection was very good, and the list of winners was just as good. I am delighted to be a part of it. Writing can take years. There is an energy born of loneliness. I try to write emotional journeys. The film had to tell its own story, so that it would become the language of the audience. I wanted to make an impact on the spectators' retinas. Erotic scenes can be very joyful to shoot, it's like making little jokes.

Given the subject of the film, I needed to film while holding back. It was difficult because I was coming to the end of a process. We had a historical responsibility around this subject so we took great care over it. We had to create space for the spectator's emotions.
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, winners of the Best Director Award for 'Le Jeune Ahmed' (Young Ahmed):
We never won this award before. We've dreamed about it. Directing is at the heart of the work we do. Cinema films life, the quivering of things, the little things that move and the movements of the body. We owe a great deal to our actor Idir Ben Addi. He has an innate sense of rhythm and rhythm is very important when it comes to directing. He had a lot of fun on the set. We shot an arrow, and Idir was that arrow, that we so obstinately tried to film. An actor is always a third, fourth, fifth director. Directing is about finding out how to live the inside of a character.
Céline Sciamma, winner of the Best Screenplay prize with 'Portrait de la Jeune Fille en Feu' (Portrait of a Lady on Fire):
It's been an exceptional year. The selection was very good, and the list of winners was just as good. I am delighted to be a part of it. Writing can take years. There is an energy born of loneliness. I try to write emotional journeys. The film had to tell its own story, so that it would become the language of the audience. I wanted to make an impact on the spectators' retinas. Erotic scenes can be very joyful to shoot, it's like making little jokes.

We're hearing the term "quid pro quo" a lot these days, but in fact we as consumers trade "something for something" almost every day. You (hopefully) paid something to read this review. I'm getting paid to write it. Who comes out ahead in the bargain?
The newest film from Korean writer/director Joon-ho Bong (Snowpiercer, Okja) sets up a situation where one family decides to enrich itself at another's expense, using the oft-cited legal precedent of "they can afford it." (That's "praestare possunt" if you want it in Latin.)
The Kims - mother, father and two university-age kids - are cagey in their poverty. They gig a living making pizza boxes, and stretch their income by sharing one plate at the all-you-can-eat buffet. When they say grace before a meal, it's to thank the man upstairs - literally - for having a simple password so they can skim off his wifi.
Parasite, like many of director Joon-ho Bong's films, doesn't fit neatly into one genre( https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/parasite-like-many-of-director-joon-ho-bongs-films-doesnt-fit-neatly-into-one-genre )
Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) gets a visit from a friend who is going abroad, and who suggests that Ki-woo fill in for him as an English tutor for a wealthy high-school girl. Introductions are made, and Ki-woo gets the job. "We'll call him Kevin," says the girl's mother, Mrs. Park (Yeo-jeong Jo), tossing an envelope of money at him.
The Park home could not be further from the Kim residence, which is below street level and so cramped that they walk around doubled over. Ki-woo is in awe of its airy spaces, manicured garden and glass-and-steel construction.
This is too good not to share - and so in short order he suggests that his friend "Jessica" (actually his sister) is just the art therapist their little boy needs. And in slightly longer order, Dad signs on as Mr. Park's new driver, and Mom gets a job as the housekeeper, after the previous incumbents prove unworthy of their jobs, with a little nudging from the Kims.
This is all great fun to behold. The director keeps us very much on the side of the parasitic Kims, and paints the wealthy Parks - the neurotic housewife, the bland businessman and their spoiled kids - as just gullible enough that we can convince ourselves they had it coming. If the Kims hadn't taken advantage of their deep pockets and trusting natures, surely someone else would have.
Kang-ho Song, Hye-jin Jang, Woo-sik Choi, and So-dam Park in Parasite.
And yet Bong isn't finished with us yet. The film runs two and a quarter hours - not a minutes of it wasted - and the second half involves a great surprise. It turns out the Park home has its own secrets, revealed in a dark twist that shifts the emphasis from satiric comedy to thriller territory, and almost into horror. Bong leads us into this realm slowly and expertly, often relying on an eclectic soundtrack - opera one moment, a jazzy all-drums set the next - to carry us forward.
And while you could write a college paper about the rich-vs-poor conflict playing out on the screen, it's also easy to just sit back and watch the fireworks. The scene where the Parks have gone away for a camping trip and the Kims have the run of the house - until the owners make an unexpected early return - is a priceless piece of comedic timing. With its economic underpinning, it's as if the Marx brothers had included Karl.

[04:30:00]
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This guy's not Barack Obama.
MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-SOUTH BEND-IN) 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, he's right. I'm not, and neither is he.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALISON KOSIK, CNN HOST: Democrats with a final push ahead of the New Hampshire primary. The Biden campaign going negative, but did it have to?
LAURA JARRETT, CNN HOST: The number of coronavirus cases nearly doubling on a quarantined ship in Japan. Now another Chinese citizen trying to spread awareness of the outbreak has been silenced.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Parasite.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: History at the Oscars. How Parasite broke 92 years of precedent at the academy awards.
Welcome back to Early Start. I'm Alison Kosik. Good morning. JARRETT: Good morning, I'm Laura Jarrett, 31 minutes past the hour here in New York. There is a new urgency in Democratic race right now. Struggling candidates are trying to salvage hopes for a comeback facing a critical juncture in tomorrow New Hampshire primary. The latest CNN poll shows a clear top tier, Bernie Sanders leading at 28 percent that's about where he was last month. And Pete Buttigieg making the biggest gains, now at 21 percent. Everybody else including Joe Biden well behind.
KOSIK: Biden and Sanders forcing the surging Buttigieg to play defense this weekend. First it was Biden, his campaign going negative with an ad in New Hampshire highlighting former Mayor Pete's experience gap.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joe Biden had to leave the passage of the affordable care act which gave health care to 20 million people. And when park goers called on Pete Buttigieg, he installed decorative lights under bridges giving citizens of South Bend colorfully illuminated rivers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Then Biden himself took a shot. He was asked about his decision to attack another moderate in the race. Listen to his answer and the response from Buttigieg.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is this an act of desperation on your campaign to be making this assertion right now of Mayor Buttigieg?
BIDEN: Oh man, this guy is not Barack Obama.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, he's right. I'm not. And neither is he. Neither is any of us running for president. And this isn't 2008. It's 2020. And we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Biden now looking beyond New Hampshire focusing squarely on the next contest in Nevada and South Carolina. Both with larger minority voting blocks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: That I've viewed from the beginning and I really mean this. I've viewed from the beginning that you have to take the first four as one. You've got two primaries and two caucuses back-to-back basically. Not a single person has won without overwhelming support from the black community, overwhelming, overwhelming. OK?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Overwhelming. Bernie Sanders meantime beating a familiar drum to go after Buttigieg. Billionaire, money and politics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm running against a candidate, Pete Buttigieg among others who has raised contributions from more than 40 billionaires.
BUTTIGIEG: Hundreds of thousands of people who supported our campaign, some of them have a lot of money. And just as I'm going to expect them to pay more in taxes when I'm president. I invite them to contribute as much as they can if they share our vision for defeating Donald Trump.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: This week there's also a lot at stake for Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. Warren came in a disappointing third in Iowa. Klobuchar placing fifth. But that was better than many had expected. And she had a strong debate performance on Friday.
KOSIK: President Trump wasting no time punishing his enemies in the aftermath of the impeachment trial. His actions undermining claims by Republican Senators about the shame of impeachment tempering the president's behavior. U.S. Ambassador to Europe Gordon Sondland sent packing. His testimony implicated the president in a direct quid pro quo exchange of favors with Ukraine.
[04:35:04]
JARRETT: Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman escorted out of the White House for testifying about the president's July 25th phone call with Ukraine's president. That came just hours after Defense Secretary Mark Esper had this to say.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK ESPER, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We welcome back all of our service members wherever they served, any assignment they're given. We protect all of our service members from retribution, anything like that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: This week, President Trump is expected to gut the National Security Council, one of the few remaining sources of non-Trumpian thought in the federal government. He's also expected to trample on Congress' power of the purse by diverting billions more in already appropriated funds to pay for his border wall.
JARRETT: Drumroll please, the newly minted best picture making history at the Oscars.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Oscar goes to Parasite.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
KOSIK: Critical darling Parasite becoming the first non-English language film in the Oscars 92 year history to win top prize. The show did not have a host, but there was no shortage of political humor.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A couple of years ago there was a big disaster here at the Oscars where they accidently read out the wrong name. And it was nobody's fault but they have guaranteed that this will not happen this year because the academy has switched to the new Iowa caucus act.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: The lack of recognition for women filmmakers came up several times. Past Oscar winner Natalie Portman even wearing a cape embroidered with the names of snubbed female directors. But the night belonged to Parasite. CNN's Stephanie Elam has more from Los Angeles.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Laura and Alison, this Oscars is all about Parasite. It's the movie that grew so much by word of mouth and a lot of people thought it was a dark horse in this race and then it just shot through. Now, walking away with four academy awards. We caught up with the Director, the screenwriter behind it, Bong Joon-ho, after his win after he came up here to the Governor's Ball. Take a listen to what he said about the win. How are you feeling right now?
BONG JOON-HO, PARASITE, SCREENWRITER (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): I think we destroyed the barrier too much. We should have taken our time actually.
JOON-HO: And when he is doing speech -- I hear like this, -- I felt like the Oscar trophy was staring at me so we locked eyes for a second.
ELAM: And that was before the drinking.
JOON-HO: Yeah, I was sober. Totally sober.
ELAM: On the acting side the wins went pretty much the way Hollywood was expecting. You have Laura Dern winning for best supporting actress for Marriage Story. Renee Zellweger winning best actress for Judy. Brad Pitt, one for Once upon a time in Hollywood. He was the best supporting actor there. And he did get a little political while he was there on stage in his acceptance speech.
BRAD PITT, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR: They told me I only have 45 seconds up here which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.
(APPLAUSE)
ELAM: And winning for best actor, as expected, Joaquin Phoenix for Joker. He's been political all award season long. This was no different.
JOAQUIN PHOENIX, BEST ACTOR, JOKER: I think at times we feel or are made to feel that we champion different causes, but for me I see commonality. I think whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or clear rights or indigenous rights or animal rights we're talking about the fight against injustice. We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.
ELAM: But still while all of the acting categories were pretty much as expected, the big news here is the win for Parasite. Definitely taking home big wins in categories that we weren't so sure. However, we can tell you it also broke history becoming the first foreign language film to win best picture. So, a great night for the Parasite team indeed. Laura and Alison.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
KOSIK: OK, that means I actually have to go see the movie now.
JARRETT: I know. I know, I'm so behind on all of them.
KOSIK: All right, the coronavirus may be centered in China, but the effects are far reaching including for the election year in the U.S. Economy.
[04:40:00]
JARRETT: The number of coronavirus cases on a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan nearly doubling. There are now 65 new cases of the virus onboard the ship bringing the total to 135. The global death toll has now climbed to 910 surpassing the 2003 SARS outbreak. There's now more than 40,000 cases worldwide. CNN's Matt Rivers on the phone from Yokohama Japan with more. Matt, how surprising is it that the number of cases keeps ticking up even though folks are in quarantine? I mean, they're basically sequestered in their rooms there.
MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Right, I think -- there's two things going on here. I think on the one hand it's already saying look, it's not the (inaudible) the number of cases go up, because this incubation period for this virus can be up to two weeks. So, even though people have been quarantined they say it's still possible that these people haven't shown symptoms and then they begin to show symptoms, or they test positive.
The key thing to take away here from what authorities are saying is they believe that all 66 new cases, and that's an eye popping number. That's why people are quite surprised by how many cases there are, but they believe that all these new cases are people who contracted the virus before this quarantine, this two week quarantine period went into effect.
So, they say because of that they believe the quarantine is working, and they are going to keep people in this quarantine. That said, that's a tough pill to swallow for people onboard. Even if they believe what Japanese authorities are saying, which most of the people (inaudible) to do, it's still difficult.
[04:45:15]
However, some are keeping a good spirit. Here's one couple from Canada we spoke to earlier today.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We still feel good. We still think we're in a good, safe place. We've quarantined ourselves. We're not getting in touch with -- we're not dealing with any other people on a personal basis.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So we've decided not to participate in the walks on deck that the captains arranged for people. We're fortunate we've got the outside cabin with a balcony.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is one of the nicest prisons in the world and here we're going to stay until we ride this out.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RIVERS: And at least here we have -- there's freedom of speech in Japan. In China where this outbreak has happened there isn't. And there's a good example of that. There's a citizen journalist from Wuhan who had really been doing some critical reporting online talking about what was going on inside of China and it was early and late last week actually that he just disappeared. And it's not uncommon for that to happen in China among citizen journalists. He disappeared. No one knew where he was until family members confirmed that he had been, quote, forced into quarantine by government officials.
You would not be mistaken if you believe that is the Chinese government trying to silence its own people trying to talk about what is happening to them. So here in Japan these people can talk about what's going on. In China, not so much.
JARRETT: that's a great point, Matt. Thank you so much for being there for us. And we want to note the Royal Caribbean Anthem Of The Sea ship, docked in New Jersey since Friday. Well, it will set sail today. Passengers began boarding Sunday after four passengers tested negative for coronavirus.
KOSIK: A strong economy is central to President Trump's re-election campaign, but the x factor in the election year economy is the coronavirus outbreak. It's hard to know how much the outbreak could affect the U.S. Economy. Goldman Sachs estimates the virus could trim four tenths of a percent from growth in 2020.
But uncertainty is already threatening global growth. There is concern about agricultural purchases. Farmers could have to wait longer to see orders for soybeans and corn coming from China. The outbreak has also disrupted the global supply chain. Shipping containers are idling in shipping ports creating uncertainty for American companies that rely on Chinese suppliers. And tourism is taking a huge hit. Airlines including American, United and Delta and others have canceled flights to and from China. And the crisis could shutdown auto plants around the world. Most assembly plants in China are closed. Widespread halt at global auto plants could become more likely if the plant shutdowns continue.
JARRETT: Another round of evacuations in New South Wales not from wildfires. This time it's flooding. Heavy rain forcing everyone to head for higher ground in several towns along Australia's Southeast Coast. More than 8 inches of rain fell in one 24-hour period in some areas. And over 15 inches have fallen in four days. That's the most in 30 years. Over 50 schools in New South Wales are closed because of the floods.
KOSIK: Winter storms Ciara causing major travel disruption across Europe. The storm forcing two of Europe's busiest airports in Frankfurt and Amsterdam to each ground more than 100 flights. A number of flights were also affected at Britain's Heathrow airport. Ciara's high winds also helping to break a new record. The fastest ever non- supersonic flight from New York to London. Just 4 hours and 56 minutes compared to the average 6 plus hours. The British airways flight reaching speeds above 800 miles an hour as it rode the Jetstream accelerated by Ciara.
JARRETT: That's a lot faster.
KOSIK: Thanks, Ciara.
JARRETT: Yes.
KOSIK: They say revenge is a dish best served cold. But how about revenge with a side of fries? CNN Business has the details on Burger King's Valentine's Day promotion next.
[04:50:00]
JARRETT: A man from the Tampa area arrested outside the White House after threatening to assassinate President Trump. According to D.C. police, 25-year-old Roger Hedgpeth approached a secret service officer on Saturday and told him he planned to kill the president. He was arrested and a 3.5 inch blade was found on his left hip. Police described Hedgpeth as a quote critically missing endangered person. He's been taken in for a mental health evaluation.
KOSIK: The watchdog for veteran's affairs is reviewing a request to investigate the V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie. Wilkie is accused of seeking dirt on a Congressional staffer who alleges she was sexually assaulted. The request to investigate Wilkie was made by California Congressman Mark Takano. One of Takano's top aides, Navy Veteran Andrea Goldstein claims she was sexually harassed and assaulted at the V.A. Medical Center in Washington last fall. Once she filed a complaint, the Washington Post reports, Secretary Wilkie began inquiring about her background and encouraging staffers to discredit her.
JARRETT: A California man arrested for allegedly posing as a ride share driver to lure women into his vehicle, 48 year-old Nassef Ragheb, a Bakersfield, facing burglary, false imprisonment, and attempted sexual battery charges. He's a suspect in a February 1st prowling case and has also been linked to several incidents involving women dating back to 2018. Police are asking any other victims who may be out there to come forward.
[04:55:13]
KOSIK: The Washington Redskins are reportedly working to hire the first full time black female coach in NFL history. That's according to the athletic. Jennifer King would also become just the fourth full- time female coach in the league. King worked closely with current Redskins coach Ron Rivera when she was an intern with the Carolina Panthers in 2017 and is expected to help out with Washington's offense. She was also an offensive assistant with Dartmouth College this past fall.
JARRETT: A 16-year-old Texas student withdraws from school after refusing to cut his hair that he's growing out to help his sick sister. Newt Johnson 11-year-old sister and best friend Maggie has Wegener disease, it's a rare auto-immune disease that affects her kidneys. Johnson wants to donate a wig to her someday, but his school handbook says male students can't have hair past their ears. Since he needs eight to 14 inches before he can donate it, Johnson dropped out. The school district says Johnson would have been allowed in class but would have to serve detention. The district also raised $3,000 to help the family with hospital expenses.
KOSIK: Well, let's get a check on CNN Business this morning. Taking a look at global markets. It's looking like a mixed picture for Asian markets although it looks like they've mostly closed lower. European markets have opened lower and on Wall Street, it's looking like we're going to start a little bit lower when stocks open in a few hours from now.
On Friday stocks closed lower despite a strong jobs report. The economy added 225,000 jobs in January. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.6 percent but for the right reasons. More people decided to get into the work force and look for a job. The DOW closed down 277 points as investors continue to worry about how the coronavirus will affect the economy. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ both closed half a percent lower.
Birds of Prey promotion with Burger King may help it at the box office. The chain is offering free whoppers to heartbroken customers on Valentine's Day. All they have to do is bring in a printed picture of their ex to the restaurant's break up boxes. Burger King says, photos brought in for the promo will be destroyed.
Don't have a photo, no problem. Customers in New York can also bring in letters, stuffed animals or a piece of clothing in exchange for their free burger. All right, I have a quick story, a stuffed animal did they say? I once broke up with a boyfriend in high school. I had given him like a cat. And we share the same locker and he cut off the cat head and left it in my locker.
Maybe he's watching right now. Who knows?
(LAUGHTER)
JARRETT: If so watch out at Burger King.
(LAUGHTER)
Well, Saturday Night Live taking jabs at the 2020 Democratic field and the conclusion of President Trump's impeachment trial.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: By the time we get to the south (inaudible), Joe Biden's going to do what Joe Biden does best, creep up from behind.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have an idea for an app. It's called no apps. No apps, no computers, no gadgets, no gizmos. You show up to your polling place, take a number like you do at the butcher, they'll call you ticket, you walk up to the counter and say to the guy give me a pound of whatever is about to go bad.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I know a lot of people like me but they worry about if I'm electable, and I have a great solution for that. Elect me.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Guess what? Elizabeth is J. Lo and I'm Shakira and so to Donald Trump I say la-la-la-la.
(LAUGHTER)
(CHEERS)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump was acquitted in the Senate trial this week and Democrats are calling it a cover-up. But does this look like a guy who can pull off a cover-up? Trump also railed against public schools calling them failing government schools. OK, but you went to private school and you don't even know where Kansas City is?
Because after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Trump mistakenly tweeted congratulations to the State of Kansas despite the fact that the Chiefs are from Kansas City Missouri. Incidentally, Kansas also has the only Manhattan where Trump is still welcome.
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: SNL really killing it.
JARRETT: The best thing about 2020 is Larry David being back on SNL. More of that please.
KOSIK: Agreed.
JARRETT: Well, thanks so much to our international viewers for joining us. Have a great rest of your day. For our USA viewers, Early Start continues right now.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: This guy's not a Barack Obama.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, he's right. I'm not and neither is he.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: Democrats with a final push ahead of the New Hampshire primary. The Biden campaign going negative, but did it have to?

For Oscar viewers eager to catch up with            Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite,” the first-ever non-English-language film to win Best Picture, the timing could not be better for streaming, because it’s just become available for rental. In fact, save for “Little Women,” “1917” and “Bombshell,” which only won in technical categories, every Oscar winner is currently streaming for a fee in digital media stores or on subscription services, and two of the three shorts are posted for free on YouTube. Bong’s twisty genre hybrid about a con that metastasizes into class warfare should be a priority, but it will be easier than usual to find out if the Academy got it right.
‘Parasite’
Won for: Best picture, director, original screenplay, international feature
Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
An underclass family infiltrates the home of a much wealthier clan in Bong Joon Ho’s impeccably orchestrated allegory about social inequality, which mixes and matches black comedy, social satire and the white-knuckle tension of a thriller. The less known about the plot, the better, given the escalating series of twists that Bong pulls off as the lives of his characters become more closely intertwined. His willingness to play with different genres and tones will be familiar to fans of his previous work, like “The Host” and “Snowpiercer,” (see where to stream those here) but rarely have they been more smoothly integrated.

‘Joker’
Won for: Best actor, original score
Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
Films based on DC Comics have tended to go darker than their Marvel counterparts, but “Joker” goes one step further, dispensing of the standard conflicts between hero and villain in favor of a deeper sociological bent. Anchored by Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur Fleck, a part-time clown and full-time mope who lives with his ailing mother in Gotham City, the film grafts the urban alienation of Martin Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver” and “The King of Comedy” onto the origin story of DC’s most famous villain. Where Heath Ledger’s Joker in “The Dark Knight” reflects a broken system, Phoenix’s Joker is the product of it.

‘Judy’
Won for: Best actress
Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
The Academy loves a splashy biopic performance, and Renée Zellweger locks into a doozy in Judy Garland, the transcendently gifted singer and actress whose triumphs on stage and screen were darkened by mental health issues and substance abuse. Rather than cover the full scope of her life, “Judy” focuses on her last year, when Garland’s sour reputation in America brings her to London in 1968. There, her efforts to revive her career are undermined by her persistent addiction. Zellweger captures both her vulnerably and her volatility as she struggles to put on one last great show.

‘Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood’
Won for: Best supporting actor, production design
Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
When it was announced that Quentin Tarantino was going to make a film about Charles Manson and the Sharon Tate murders, surely no one expected anything like “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood,” which builds to that fateful night on Cielo Drive, but approaches it from a side angle. Through the fictional characters of the fading Western star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his faithful stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), Tarantino revivifies Hollywood in the summer of ’69 and captures its turbulent undercurrents with the sensitivity of a seismograph. Before the inevitable spasms of violence, the film is a bittersweet elegy for the end of an era.

‘Marriage Story’
Won for: Best supporting actress
Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
Divorce has colored the life and work of the writer-director Noah Baumbach, and he brings all that experience to bear on “Marriage Story,” a comedy-drama about the agonies and possibilities of uncoupling. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are both superb as a creative couple who cannot come to terms amicably on their own, so they engage in an emotionally and financially costly legal dispute. Baumbach makes an enemy of the process, which brings out the worst in both of them, but even the lawyers have a human dimension, especially Laura Dern as a powerful L.A. attorney who approaches the job with empathy and aggression.

‘Jojo Rabbit’
Won for: Best adapted screenplay
Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
Turning Adolf Hitler into a little boy’s imaginary friend sounds like an unworkable conceit, but Taika Waititi’s nervy crowd-pleaser treats Der Führer as a Beatles-like phenomenon that whipped young people like Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) into a nationalist frenzy. Jojo’s time in a Hitler Youth camp is like watching “Moonrise Kingdom” with Nazis, but Waititi undercuts the absurdity by detailing the boy’s relationship with a Jewish girl his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has hidden behind his bedroom walls. In the battle for his conscience, Hitler proves to be a formidable adversary.

‘American Factory’
Won for: Best documentary
Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
When the Chinese glass company Fuyao reopens a Dayton, Ohio factory that once housed General Motors, many former G.M. employees return to the work force with the hope of renewed prosperity and cross-cultural harmony. The filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar are present for that optimistic moment and they stay through the difficulties that follow, as differences in work ethic, employee safety and compensation open up a rift between Chinese management and disgruntled American line workers. The promise and peril of this globalist experiment is evoked through Reichert and Bognar’s compassionate eye.

‘Toy Story 4’
Won for: Best animated feature
Where to watch: Stream it on Disney Plus. Rent it on            iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
The breakout character in this Pixar sequel is Forky, a humble and dimwitted little spork with pipe-cleaner arms, misaligned googly eyes and Popsicle sticks for feet. He’s a charming creation who doubles a signal for the low-stakes ambition of “Toy Story 4,” which includes the expected Rube Goldberg set pieces and heartstring-tugging of the previous three, but feels more like a stand-alone adventure. Here Woody and the gang are waylaid at a carnival, where they reunite with Little Bo Peep, but have to face the possibility that life may send them on separate destinies.

‘Hair Love’
Won for: Best animated short
Where to watch: Stream it on YouTube.
From Kickstarter phenomenon to Oscar winner, “Hair Love,” directed by Matthew A. Cherry, Everett Downing Jr. and Bruce W. Smith, is about nothing more than a black father struggling to style his daughter’s seemingly untamable hair. But within that simple premise, played for equal parts whimsy and sentiment, the movie tells a story about black confidence and identity as well as the rewarding hard work of parenthood. Father and daughter don’t say a word to each other. They don’t need to.

‘The Neighbor’s Window’
Won for: Best live-action short
Where to watch: Stream it on YouTube.
After three nominations for documentary Oscars — including one for “Street Fight,” about a young Cory Booker’s insurgent campaign for mayor of Newark — the director Marshall Curry finally wins one for a tight piece of short fiction that uses a “Rear Window” scenario to reflect on a rocky marriage. Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller star as the beleaguered parents of young children who naturally get jealous when a good-looking, amorous couple moves into the building across the street and doesn’t bother to put up drapes. But that grass-is-greener feeling dissipates as the strangers they’re watching turn out to have more complicated lives than they initially believe.

‘Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You’re a Girl)’
Won for: Best documentary short
Where to watch: Stream it on Hulu.
Founded in 2007, the nonprofit organization Skateistan has included skateboarding as part of a larger educational mission to serve disadvantaged children in Afghanistan, South Africa and Cambodia, 50% of them girls. Carol Dysinger’s 40-minute documentary short narrows the focus to Kabul, Afghanistan, where a brutal patriarchy has persisted after the Taliban. Many girls are denied access to schools and face restrictive and often violent conditions at home. At a secure facility, they’re taught how to read and write, but as the title promises, there are skateboarding lessons, too, intended to empower and delight them.
‘Ford v. Ferrari’
Won for: Best editing, sound editing
Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes,            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
The ultimate in Dad-friendly entertainment for a Sunday afternoon, James Mangold’s muscular gear head drama about the quest for supremacy between automakers in 1966 stays squarely within its lane, banking on nitro-charged racing sequences and old-fashioned star turns by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby, who’s commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to build a car fast enough to defeat the dominant Ferrari fleet at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With the volatile Ken Miles (Bale) as his driver, Carroll and his team of engineers put together a winner through hard work, sweat and a lot of spit and bubble gum.

‘Rocketman’
Won for: Best Original Song
Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes. Rent it on            Amazon,            Vudu,            Google Play and            YouTube.
If this Elton John biopic feels like a more well-engineered piece of craftsmanship than last year’s Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” it might be because Dexter Fletcher, who replaced Bryan Singer as the director of the earlier film late in production, was on board here from the beginning. “Rocketman” defies precisely none of the genre’s clichés, but the ascendence of young Reginald Dwight into the pop legend better known as Elton John is a satisfying arc nonetheless. Taron Egerton’s robust lead performance is one reason, but classic singles like “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting,” “Crocodile Rock” and “Your Song” give it the quality of a jukebox musical.

•	South Korean director Bong Joon-ho picked up Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or
•	The film is about a poor family of hustlers who find jobs with a wealthy family
•	Parasite has received rave reviews and a five-minute standing ovation
•	Joon-ho is the first Korean filmmaker to ever win the coveted Palme d'Or
•	The Grand Prize went to director Mati Diop's feature-film debut Atlantics
South Korean director Bong Joon-ho picked up Cannes Film Festival's coveted Palme d'Or award for his social satire Parasite on Saturday night.
The film was awarded the festival's top prize, while Quentin Tarantino's latest outing Once Upon A Time In Hollywood was snubbed by the board in all categories.
Joon-ho's tragicomedy is about a poor family of hustlers who find jobs with a wealthy family, but become embroiled in dark, unexpected and currently unknown incident. 
Similarly to Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, little has been revealed about the film so that the audience can enjoy it without knowing how the plot will unfurl. 
Parasite has received rave reviews ever since it premiered at the glitzy event and received a five-minute standing ovation from the audience.
It stars one of Korea's most prolific actors, Song Kang-ho, and Parasite marks the fourth time he's worked with prestigious director Joon-ho. 
Joon-ho is the first Korean filmmaker to ever win the Palme d'Or and also only the second Asian filmmaker be awarded the prize after Hirokazu Koreeda won it last year for his family drama, and Oscar nominee, Shoplifters. 
In the festival's closing ceremony, jury president Alejandro Inarritu said the choice had been 'unanimous' for the nine-person jury.
The genre-mixing film had arguably been celebrated more than others at Cannes this year, hailed by critics as the best yet from the 49-year-old director.
Joon-ho's previous successes include Netflix hit Okja starring Tilda Swinton, South Korean murder mystery Memoirs Of A Murderer and cult hit Snowpiercer. 
The decision to allow Netflix films Okja and The Meyerowitz Stories by Noah Baumbach to compete in Cannes in 2017 sparked outrage.
Film festival head Thierry Fremaux, 57, said Netflix and other streamers could still screen their movies, but couldn't vie for the top prize, according to an article by The Hollywood Reporter.
Fremaux said he wanted the films by the acclaimed directors to premiere at Cannes instead of going to another festival, but neither one of them won.
'Last year, when we selected these two films, I thought I could convince Netflix to release them in cinemas. I was presumptuous, they refused,' Fremaux said.
Netflix tried to secure permits to screen the movies, but ran afoul of France's strict chronology laws surrounding film release. The festival has since changed its rules to require theatrical release in France.
The festival's second place award, the Grand Prize, went to French-Senegalese director Mati Diop's feature-film debut, Atlantics. The film by Diop, the first black female director ever in competition in Cannes, views the migrant crisis from the perspective of Senegalese women left behind after many young men flee by sea to Spain.
Although few quibbled with the choice of Bong, some had expected Cannes to make history by giving the Palme to a female filmmaker for just the second time. Celine Sciamma's period romance Portrait of a Lady on Fire was the Palme pick for many critics this year. Instead, Sciamma ended up with best screenplay.
In the festival's 72-year history, only Jane Champion has won the prize in 1993 for The Piano, tying with Chen Kaige's Farewell My Concubine.
Best actor went to Antonio Banderas for Pedro Almodovar's reflective drama Pain and Glory. In the film, one of the most broadly acclaimed of the festival, Banderas plays a fictionalised version of Almodovar looking back on his life and career.
'The best is still to come,' said Banderas, accepting the award.
                     CANNES' FILM FESTIVAL WINNERS                    
- Palme d'Or: 'Parasite' by Bong Joon-ho (South Korea)
- Grand Prix: 'Atlantics' by Mati Diop (France)
- Jury Prize: 'Les Miserables' by Ladj Ly (France) and 'Nighthawk' by Kleber Mendonca Filho (Brazil)
- Best director: Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne (Belgium) for 'Young Ahmed'
- Best actress: Emily Beecham (Britain) for 'Little Joe'
- Best actor: Antonio Banderas (Spain) for 'Pain and Glory'
- Special mention: 'It Must Be Heaven' by Elia Suleiman
- Best screeplay: 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire' by Celine Sciamma (France)
The Belgian brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, who have already twice won the Palme d'Or, took the best director prize for Young Ahmed, their portrait of Muslim teenager who becomes radicalized by a fundamentalist imam.
The jury prize, or third place, was split between two socially conscious thrillers: The French director Ladj Ly's feature-film debut Les Miserables and Brazilian director Kleber Mendonça Filho's Bacurau. 
British actress Emily Beecham won best actress for her performance in Jessica Hausner's science-fiction drama Little Joe. The jury also gave a special mention to Palestinian director Elia Suleiman's 'It Must Be Heaven.'
The Camera d'Or, an award given for best first feature from across all of Cannes' sections, went to César Díaz's 'Our Mothers,' a drama about the Guatemalan civil war in the 1980s. 
Tarantino, who attended the closing ceremony, didn't go home empty handed. On Friday, a prominent pooch in his film won the annual Palme Dog, an award given by critics to Cannes' best canine.

Bong Joon Ho's Parasite -- winner of this year's Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival -- has gotten a release date with distributor Neon. 
Parasite will hit theaters on Oct. 11 in Los Angeles and New York before receiving a platformed release that will expand the film onto more screens. The fall release places the feature, a foreign film frontrunner, in contention for awards season. 
Joon Ho's modern fairy tale received universal praise after its debut, earning a 97 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Hollywood Reporter review says the movie "packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times." 
Parasite follows two families -- the wealthy Parks and the street smart Kims -- whose entangled lives are threatened by greed and class prejudices. 
Also opening on Oct. 11 will be Ang Lee's Gemini Man, starring Will Smith, and Sony's long-awaited Zombieland sequel.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 2020 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This guy's not Barack Obama.
MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-SOUTH BEND-IN) 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Oh, he's right. I'm not, and neither is he.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
LAURA JARRETT, CNN HOST: Democrats with a final push ahead of the New Hampshire primary. The Biden campaign going negative, but did it have to?
ALISON KOSIK, CNN HOST: The number of coronavirus cases nearly doubling on a quarantined ship in Japan. Now another Chinese citizen trying to spread awareness of the outbreak has been silenced.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Parasite.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: History at the Oscars. How Parasite broke 92 years of precedence at the Academy Awards. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. This is Early Start. I'm Alison Kosik. Good morning.
JARRETT: Good morning. I'm Laura Jarrett, so glad you're here with us. It's Monday, February 10th, 4:00 a.m. in New York.
A new urgency in the Democratic race, struggling candidates trying to salvage hopes for a comeback face a critical juncture in tomorrow's primary in New Hampshire.
The latest CNN poll shows a clear top tier. Bernie Sanders leading at 28 percent. That's about where he was last month. And Pete Buttigieg making the biggest gains now at 21 percent. Everybody else including Joe Biden well behind.
KOSIK: Biden and Sanders forcing the searching Buttigieg to play defense this weekend. First it was Biden, his campaign going negative with an ad in New Hampshire highlighting former Mayor Pete's experience gap.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joe Biden had to leave the passage of the affordable care act which gave health care to 20 million people. And when park goers called on Pete Buttigieg, he installed decorative lights under bridges giving citizens of South Bend colorfully illuminated rivers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: Then Biden himself took a shot. He was asked about his decision to attack another moderate in the race. Listen to his answer and the response from Buttigieg.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is this an act of desperation on your campaign to be making this assertion right now of Mayor Buttigieg?
BIDEN: Oh man, this guy is not Barack Obama.
BUTTIGIEG: He's right. I'm not. And neither is he. Neither is any of us running for president. And this isn't 2008. It's 2020. And we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: Biden now looking beyond New Hampshire focusing squarely on the next contest in Nevada and South Carolina. Both with bigger minority voting blocks.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: That I've viewed from the beginning and I really mean this. I've viewed from the beginning that you have to take the first four as one. You've got two primaries and two caucuses back-to-back basically. Not a single person has won without overwhelming support from the black community, overwhelming, overwhelming. OK?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: Bernie Sanders meantime beating a familiar drum to go after Buttigieg. Billionaire, money and politics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I-VT), U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm running against a candidate, Pete Buttigieg among others who has raised contributions from more than 40 billionaires.
BUTTIGIEG: Hundreds of thousands of people who supported our campaign, some of them have a lot of money. And just as I'm going to expect them to pay more in taxes when I'm president. I invite them to contribute as much as they can if they share our vision for defeating Donald Trump.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: There's also a lot at stake this week for Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. Warren came in a disappointing third in Iowa. Klobuchar placing fifth. But that was better than many expected, and she had a strong debate performance on Friday. Stay with CNN for full coverage from New Hampshire. Special coverage begins tomorrow at 4:00 p.m. Eastern right here on CNN.
Bernie Sanders backtrack on a promise to release his full medical records. Last September prior to having a heart attack, the Vermont Senator insisted he would release the records before the Democratic primaries. That hasn't happened. And it sounds like it may not happen at all.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Shouldn't voters see your medical records?
SANDERS: We released as much documentation as I think any other campaign.
TODD: But no other candidate has had a hard attack.
SANDERS: Well, look, I am out -- I'm the only candidate is doing four to five events a day in this country.
TODD: I hear you. I mean, no doubt you've proven your mettle here but voters -- you've heard voters had been concerned about you.
SANDERS: I mean, you can start releasing medical records and it never ends.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
[04:05:00]
KOSIK: The 78-year-old Sanders says since his heart attack he's been trying to do more walking and get more sleep.
President Trump wasting no time punishing his enemies in the aftermath of the impeachment trial. His actions undermining claims by Republican Senators about the shame of impeachment tempering the president's behavior. The U.S. Ambassador to Europe Gordon Sondland sent packing. His testimony implicated the president in a direct quid pro quo exchange of favors with Ukraine.
JARRETT: Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman escorted out of the White House for testifying about the president's July 25th phone call with Ukraine's president. That came just hours after Defense Secretary Mark Esper said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK ESPER, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: We welcome back all of our service members wherever they served, any assignment they're given. We protect all of our service members from retribution, anything like that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: This week, President Trump is expected to gut the National Security Council, one of the few remaining sources of non-Trumpian thought in the federal government. He's also expected to trample on Congress' power of the purse by diverting billions more in already appropriated funds to pay for his border wall.
KOSIK: Fresh off a strong job report President Trump is expected to release a multi-trillion dollar budget with big cuts to safety net programs. The $ 4.8 trillion plan calls for cuts to nondefense discretionary programs which does not include Medicare or social security.
The Wall Street Journal reports the plan does include cuts to mandatory spending programs including $130 billion in changes to Medicare prescription drug pricing, $292 billion in safety net cuts, such as work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps and $70 billion from tightening eligibility access to disability benefits.
As a candidate Trump promised to get rid of the national debt, but the proposed budget plan would not eliminate a deficit never mind the debt in the next 10 years. The deficit has ballooned partly because of tax cuts and a two year budget deal that boosted federal spending. Usually budget deficits widen during economic downturns, but the economy is expanding, and unemployment is at a 50-year low.
JARRETT: The newly minted best picture making history at the Oscars.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Oscar goes to Parasite.
(APPLAUSE)
(CHEERS)
JARRETT: Critical darling Parasite becoming the first non-English language film in the Oscars 92nd year history to win top prize. The show didn't have a host, but there was no shortage of political humor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A couple of years ago there was a big disaster here at the Oscars where they accidently read out the wrong name. And it was nobody's fault but they have guaranteed that this will not happen this year because the academy has switched to the new Iowa caucus act.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: the lack of recognition for women filmmakers came up several times. Past Oscar winner Natalie Portman even wearing a cape that was embroidered with the names of snubbed female directors. But the night belonged to Parasite. CNN's Stephanie Elam has more now from Los Angeles.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Laura and Alison, this Oscars is all about Parasite. It's the movie that grew so much by word of mouth and a lot of people thought it was a dark horse in this race and then it just shot through. Now, walking away with four academy awards. We caught up with the Director, the screenwriter behind it, Bong Joon-ho, after his win after he came up here to the Governor's Ball. Take a listen to what he said about the win. How are you feeling right now?
BONG JOON-HO, PARASITE, SCREENWRITER (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): I think we destroyed the barrier too much. We should have taken our time actually.
JOON-HO: And when he is doing speech -- I hear like this, -- I felt like the Oscar trophy was staring at me so we locked eyes for a second.
ELAM: And that was before the drinking.
JOON-HO: Yeah, I was sober. Totally sober.
ELAM: On the acting side the wins went pretty much the way Hollywood was expecting. You have Laura Dern winning for best supporting actress for Marriage Story. Renee Zellweger winning best actress for Judy. Brad Pitt, one for Once upon a time in Hollywood. He was the best supporting actor there. And he did get a little political while he was there on stage in his acceptance speech.
BRAD PITT, HOLLYWOOD ACTOR: They told me I only have 45 seconds up here which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.
(APPLAUSE)
ELAM: And winning for best actor, as expected, Joaquin Phoenix for Joker. He's been political all award season long. This was no different.
JOAQUIN PHOENIX, BEST ACTOR, JOKER: I think at times we feel or are made to feel that we champion different causes, but for me I see commonality. I think whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or clear rights or indigenous rights or animal rights we're talking about the fight against injustice. We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control and use and exploit another with impunity.
[04:10:30]
ELAM: But still while all of the acting categories were pretty much as expected, the big news here is the win for Parasite. Definitely taking home big wins in categories that we weren't so sure. However, we can tell you it also broke history becoming the first foreign language film to win best picture. So, a great night for the Parasite team indeed. Laura and Alison.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
JARRETT: Such a big sweep for Parasite. There's great behind the scenes footage of the Director actually apologizing to the engravers for having too many Oscars. It's a great night for him.
KOSIK: OK. Two U.S. soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Another round of violence in an already violent year against Americans.
[04:15:00]
KOSIK: The number of coronavirus cases on a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan nearly doubling. There are 66 new cases of the virus onboard the ship bringing the total to 136. The death toll has now climb to 910, surpassing the 2003 SARS outbreak. There's now more than 40,000 cases worldwide.
CNN's Matt Rivers is live for us in Yokohama, Japan with more. Now, we know that thousands are on this ship, but this jump in the number of people showing that they have the coronavirus, it's a little stunning. What's the reaction you're hearing?
MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean that's a good way to put it. You know, we were expecting maybe there to be a slight increase today. You know, in the last couple of days we've seen three new cases, then six new cases, but this news came out this afternoon, 66 new cases. That's nearly a 100 percent increase over the 70 cases which is where we stood yesterday. And so that freaked people out a little bit.
And the question was that's been hanging over all of this, is the virus still being spread onboard the cruise ship even though passengers have been put into a two-week quarantine? What officials are saying though is no. They believe that all 66 of these cases are people that contracted the virus before the quarantined was put into place on Monday.
So that quarantine will remain in place for the next 10 days or so because they believe that it is working onboard. Still, this number is scary, and it shows you how quickly this virus can spread. That said, people onboard taking it pretty well. We spoke to a couple from Canada. Rose and Greg, here's what they had to say after today's news.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We still feel good. We still think we're in a good, safe place. We've quarantined ourselves. We're not getting in touch with -- we're not dealing with any other people on a personal basis.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: So we've decided not to participate in the walks on deck that the captains arranged for people. We're fortunate we've got the outside cabin with a balcony.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is one of the nicest prisons in the world and here we're going to stay until we ride this out.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
RIVERS: A really good spirit on those two. Now, they're going to be stuck in quarantine until February 19th, but Alison, really it's just day to day here in Yokohama. Each day people wake up and wonder how many more cases are going to be confirmed today.
KOSIK: They are definitely good sports. They're giving the old thumbs up. Matt, thanks very much.
And we wanted to note the Royal Caribbean Anthem Of The Sea ship that docked in New Jersey since Friday it will set sail today. Passengers began boarding Sunday after four passengers tested negative for the coronavirus.
JARRETT: Two U.S. Army Green Berets were killed and six others wounded in an attack on a joint U.S.-Afghan operation over the weekend. The Pentagon on Sunday identified the two sergeants killed as Javier Gutierrez of San Antonio, and Antonio Ray Rodriguez of (Inaudible), New Mexico.
The pentagon says the shooter was wearing an Afghan army uniform. The attack is under investigation now. It's the latest in a series of deadly incidents in Afghanistan involving Americans in the last month including an explosive device, a plane crash and an abduction.
KOSIK: A Congressional staffer reported a sexual assault. Why investigators now want to speak with the secretary of veterans affairs.
[04:20:00]
JARRETT: The watchdog for veteran's affairs is reviewing a request to investigate the V.A. Secretary Robert Wilkie. Wilkie is accused of seeking dirt on a Congressional staffer who alleges she was sexually assaulted. The request to investigate Wilkie was made by California Congressman Mark Takano. One of Takano's top aides, Navy Veteran Andrea Goldstein claims she was sexually harassed and assaulted at the V.A. Medical Center Washington last fall. Once she filed a complaint, the Washington Post reports, Secretary Wilkie began inquiring about her background and encouraging staffers to discredit her.
KOSIK: The man who launched two shootings attacks on New York City police officers over the weekend said he did it because he hate cops. Police say the first attack took place Saturday on two officers sitting in a van at the 41st precinct in the Bronx. The second happening the next morning on uniformed officer and a civilian employee inside the precinct.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DERMONT SHEA, NYPD COMMISIONER: This is not a crime gone bad. This is not a liquor store robbery interrupted that a tragedy erupts from. This is a premeditated assassination attempt.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: The commissioner says in all two officers were shot but survived. The suspect, 45-year-old Robert Williams is set to be arraigned today.
JARRETT: A man is under arrest this morning for driving a van through a tent with Trump campaign volunteers in Jacksonville, Florida. Gregory Tim faces charged of aggravated assault, criminal mischief and driving on a suspended driver's license.
[04:25:00]
The Jacksonville sheriff's office say they're still investigating whether the incident was politically motivated. Trump quickly jumped onto Twitter to condemn the attack warning, quote, be careful tough guys with who you play with. No one was injured.
KOSIK: OK, we all no Bill Nye the science guy, but how about Bill Nye the style guy? Watch the style guy, watch this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(END VIDEO CLIP)
(LAUGHTER)
KOSIK: So, if you notice as he's walking, everybody is kind a walking chill, but when they see him getting down to Lizzo, everybody else kind a starts dancing as well. Who knew the popular science explainer had moves. Nye was caught on TikTok, dancing down the runway to Lizzo, during New York fashion week. He was there for the blue jacket fashion show, an event raising awareness for men's health and prostate cancer treatment.
JARRETT: First of all, I love that he's in fashion week. Look at that jacket. The brocade is gorgeous.
KOSIK: And look how comfortable he is in his own skin grooving to the music.
JARRETT: Go ahead Bill Nye.
Well, time is running out for candidates to gain traction in Democratic race. Was is smart of Joe Biden to go negative when he claims his surge is just around the corner?

[05:30:00]
LAURA JARRETT, CNN ANCHOR: Explosive device, a plane crash, and an abduction.
EARLY START continues right now.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This guy's not a Barack Obama.
PETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, he's right, I'm not, and neither is he.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
ALISON KOSIK, CNN ANCHOR: Democrats with a final push ahead of the New Hampshire primary. The Biden campaign going negative, but did it have to?
JARRETT: The number of coronavirus cases nearly doubling on a quarantined ship in Japan. Now, another Chinese citizen trying to spread awareness of the outbreak has been silenced.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JANE FONDA, ACTRESS, OSCAR PRESENTER: "Parasite."
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: History at the Oscars. How "Parasite" broke 92 years of precedent at the Academy Awards.
Good morning, this is EARLY START. I'm Alison Kosik.
JARRETT: And I'm Laura Jarrett, about 30 minutes past the hour here in New York.
There is a new urgency in the Democratic race right now. Struggling candidates trying to salvage hopes for a comeback, they face a critical juncture in tomorrow's New Hampshire primary.
The latest CNN poll shows a clear top tier. Bernie Sanders leading at 28 percent. That's about where he was last month. And, Pete Buttigieg making the biggest gains, now at 21 percent. Everybody else, including Joe Biden, well behind.
KOSIK: Biden and Sanders forcing the surging Buttigieg to play defense this weekend. First, it was Biden -- his campaign going negative with an ad in New Hampshire highlighting former Mayor Pete's experience gap.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN POLITICAL AD: Joe Biden helped lead the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which gave health care to 20 million people. And when parkgoers called on Pete Buttigieg, he installed decorative lights under bridges, giving citizens of South Bend colorfully illuminated rivers.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: Then, Biden, himself, taking a shot. He was asked about his decision to attack another moderate in the race. Listen to his answer and the response from Buttigieg.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Is this a (sic) act of desperation on your campaign to be making this --
BIDEN: Aw, come on, man, you think --
ZELENY: -- assertion right now --
BIDEN: This guy's -- this guy's not --
ZELENY: -- of Mayor Buttigieg?
BIDEN: -- a Barack Obama.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, he's right, I'm not, and neither is he. Neither is any of us running for president. And this isn't 2008, it's 2020 and we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Biden is now looking beyond New Hampshire, focusing squarely on the next contest in Nevada and South Carolina, both with bigger minority voting blocs.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BIDEN: That I've viewed from the beginning -- and I really mean this -- I've viewed from the beginning that you have to take the first four as one. You've got two primaries and two caucuses back-to-back, basically. And not a single person has won without overwhelming support from the black community -- overwhelming -- overwhelming, OK? So, here --
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: In case you missed it, it's overwhelming.
Bernie Sanders, meantime, beating a familiar drum to go after Buttigieg -- billionaire money and politics.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am running against a candidate -- Pete Buttigieg, among others -- who has raised contributions from more than 40 billionaires.
BUTTIGIEG: The hundreds of thousands of people who've supported our campaign, some of them have a lot of money. And just as I'm going to expect them to pay more in taxes when I'm president, I invite them to contribute as much as they can if they share our vision for defeating Donald Trump.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: This week, there's also a lot at stake for Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. Warren came in a disappointing third in Iowa. Klobuchar placing fifth, but she had more support than many had expected. She also had a strong debate performance on Friday.
President Trump wasting no time punishing his enemies in the aftermath of the impeachment trial. His actions undermining claims by Republican senators about the shame of impeachment tempering the president's behavior.
The U.S. ambassador to Europe, Gordon Sondland, sent packing. His testimony implicated the president in a direct quid pro quo exchange of favors with Ukraine.
JARRETT: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman escorted out of the White House for testifying about the president's July 25th phone call with Ukraine's president. That came just hours after Defense Sec. Mark Esper said this.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
MARK ESPER, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: We welcome back all of our service members, wherever they served, to any assignment they're given. We protect all of our persons -- service members from retribution or anything -- anything like that.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: CNN has just learned Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer sent a letter to the acting Department of Defense inspector general requesting investigations into retaliation against witnesses.
This week, President Trump is expected to gut the National Security Council, one of the few remaining sources of non-Trumpian thought in the federal government.
[05:35:05]
He's also expected to trample on Congress' power of the purse by diverting billions more in already appropriated funds to pay for his border wall.
KOSIK: And we're going to have a lot more on all of this. Plus, a congressional staffer reporting a sexual assault. Why investigators want to speak with the secretary of Veterans Affairs.
KOSIK: Just one day to go until New Hampshire's Democratic primary. Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg way ahead in the polls and showing momentum. But, Joe Biden is struggling and he's going negative in a way that could backfire in the long run.
JARRETT: Joining us to discuss, Princeton University historian and professor Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst as well. Julian, good morning.
JULIAN ZELIZER, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, HISTORIAN AND PROFESSOR, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, CO-AUTHOR, "FAULT LINES: A HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES SINCE 1974": Good morning.
KOSIK: Good morning.
[05:40:00]
JARRETT: Always great to have you on set.
ZELIZER: Thank you.
JARRETT: So, the New Hampshire primary is shaping up a little bit like Iowa. You've got Buttigieg and Sanders in the top tier right now. Obviously, Sanders ahead in most of the polls. It's almost shaping up to be the moderate millennial against the boomer socialist, self- described Democratic socialist.
If Buttigieg comes in a close second tomorrow night in New Hampshire, what does that mean for the race?
ZELIZER: Well, I think the two of them have positioned themselves well and I'm not sure it matters if either of them are slightly in second place. In some ways, the big story is who comes in third and fourth.
What happens to Sen. Warren? Can she deliver in this neighboring state? And does that put her campaign in peril?
And what happens if Joe Biden does poorly again? Everyone's always anticipated his campaign will be about Super Tuesday. But this does shake up fundraisers and deflate organizers.
KOSIK: Yes.
And speaking of Joe Biden, he's getting some criticism that he's not aggressive enough. So guess what? He's going negative. You look at the ads -- you look at how he's talking to potential voters and being negative.
What risks are there? Does he risk alienating every mid-sized city in America by doing this?
ZELIZER: Well, you can go negative. Politics ain't beanbag, as they say. You have to be tough.
But he's always been a little bit of a mystery in terms of what he's about. His claim is he's electable. His claim is he was vice president. So the risk is that it all becomes about the attack and that he never fills out the substance.
Sen. Sanders, we know what he's about. In some ways, we now know what Mayor Pete is about. Biden still has defining to do and that's the risk if it's just attack, attack, attack.
JARRETT: But was this a good idea right now? I mean, he's kind of described this race as the first four -- you know, that's one bloc and then we'll all move along. But -- I mean, how are people in the Midwest supposed to receive and ad like that and think oh, that's somebody who speaks to me and my issues?
ZELIZER: No, you're right. There is a way to turn off the voter if that's all that they see. And in some ways, Biden's an aspirational candidate in that he's supposed to be politics can be in a better place.
JARRETT: Yes.
ZELIZER: Politics can be different.
So I think some might receive that and say well, he's more of the same and I'm going to go with these other choices who are more defined and who seem to have a little more --
JARRETT: Sure.
ZELIZER: -- there there in terms of the substance.
KOSIK: You brought up Elizabeth Warren. Can Elizabeth Warren, can Amy Klobuchar -- can they survive a bad night? Let's say, one of them or both have a bad night in New Hampshire.
ZELIZER: They can survive in that we have a multicandidate process, but I do think it would really hurt Warren. This -- the first two contests were somewhere Warren was expected to do well, like Sanders and Buttigieg. She has not. And I would imagine if she performs really poorly, she's going to be struggling or cutting funds and then that hurts you in the next run.
Klobuchar, she's staying in this place and waiting for things to break and I think there's space for her to continue doing that.
JARRETT: Yes. Before we let you go, I want to get your thoughts on the president firing Ambassador Gordon Sondland and also Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. We saw that over the weekend.
And it's not just them. I mean, if you look at this map here you can see there are eight different officials -- career diplomats who have either been forced out or who have essentially retired and decided they're getting out of this.
I mean, what do you -- what do you make of this and this retaliatory firing? I mean, that's what it is. These are people who spoke out against the president in testimony and are now out of a job.
ZELIZER: It's a purge and this is what President Trump does. He's very vindictive. He's very uncomfortable with any disloyal around him and he goes after anyone who has gone after him.
So if you're in his inner circle, this is what's happening. He's trying to clear out his Oval Office.
But it's a dangerous message to people who are open to testifying, who are open to being honest about what's going on or what's going wrong. This sends a message there's no room for that in the White House.
JARRETT: Yes, and it makes you wonder -- I mean, what career folks who are still at the State Department are supposed to think about all of this.
ZELIZER: No, it's a totally politicized environment.
JARRETT: Yes.
Julian, it's always good to see you.
ZELIZER: Thank you.
KOSIK: Thanks for joining us.
JARRETT: Thank you so much.
KOSIK: And the newly-minted best picture is making history at the Oscars.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
FONDA: And the Oscar goes to "Parasite."
(END VIDEO CLIP)
KOSIK: Critical darling "Parasite" becoming the first non-English language film in Oscar's 92-year history to win the top prize.
The show did not have a host but there was no shortage of political humor.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE MARTIN, ACTOR-COMEDIAN: A couple of years ago there was a big disaster here at the Oscars where they accidentally read out the wrong name, and it was nobody's fault. But they have guaranteed that this will not happen this year because the Academy has switched to the new Iowa caucus app.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
[05:45:05]
JARRETT: The lack of recognition for women filmmakers came up several times. Past Oscar winner Natalie Portman even wearing a cape embroidered with the names of snubbed female directors.
But the night clearly belonged to "Parasite."
CNN's Stephanie Elam has more from Los Angeles.
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Laura and Alison, this Oscars is all about "Parasite." It's the movie that grew so much by word of mouth. And a lot of people thought it was a dark horse in this race and then it just shown through and now, walking away with four Academy Awards.
We caught up with the director -- the screenwriter behind it, Bong Joon Ho, after his win -- after he came up here to the Governors Ball. Take a listen to what he said about the win.
How are you feeling right now?
BONG JOON HO, DIRECTOR, "PARASITE" (through translator): I think we destroyed the barrier too much. We should have taken our time, actually.
HO: When he was doing speech, I was like this -- you know, (speaking foreign language).
TRANSLATOR: It was like the Oscar trophy was staring at me, so we locked eyes for a second.
ELAM: And that was before the drinking.
HO: Yes, I was sober. Totally sober.
ELAM: On the acting side, the wins went pretty much the way Hollywood was expecting.
You had Laura Dern winning for Best Supporting Actress for "Marriage Story." Renee Zellweger winning Best Actress for "Judy."
Brad Pitt won for "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood." He was the best supporting actor there. And he did get a little political while he was there on stage in his acceptance speech. BRAD PITT, BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR, "ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD": They told me I only have 45 seconds up where, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.
ELAM: And winning for best actor, as expected, Joaquin Phoenix for "Joker." He's been political all awards season long. This was no different.
JOAQUIN PHOENIX, BEST ACTOR, "JOKER": I think, at times, we feel or we're made to feel that we champion different causes. But for me, I see commonality. I think whether we're talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we're talking about the fight against injustice. We're talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender or one species has the right to dominate, control, and use and exploit another with impunity.
ELAM: But still, while all of the acting categories were pretty much as expected, the big news here is the win for "Parasite," definitely taking home big wins in categories that we weren't so sure. However, we can tell you it also broke history becoming the first foreign- language film to win best picture. So, a great night for the "Parasite" team, indeed -- Laura and Alison.
(END VIDEOTAPE)
JARRETT: Stephanie, thanks so much.
We'll be right back.
[05:52:25]
JARRETT: The number of coronavirus cases on a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan nearly doubling. There are now 65 new cases of the virus onboard the ship, bringing the total to 135.
The global death toll has now climbed to 910. That surpasses the 2003 SARS outbreak. There's now more than 40,000 cases worldwide.
CNN's Will Ripley live in Tokyo outside a hospital where an American woman from the ship is being treated. So, Will, break this down for us. If you have any indication that you have the virus, even if you don't have symptoms, you're off the ship.
WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right. In fact, we have pictures from the ship where you can see a very large -- the largest we've seen, so far -- a line of ambulances that have been taking people off the ship because they're being taken to hospitals like this one. There are hospitals across Japan that are being used to treat coronavirus patients. This is just one of them.
In fact, we just saw an ambulance a few minutes ago pass by. The lights were off. It was kind of quietly moving in as not to disturbed this residential neighborhood that the hospital sits next to, but the people who were driving it were in full hazmat protective gear. So we know that that was an ambulance with coronavirus patients most likely taken from the cruise ship because it looks just like all of the other ones that we've seen rolling away from the ship.
But, yes, if you have no symptoms, if you have a minor case, you're still in quarantine because they just know so little about coronavirus and there is no, at this point, necessarily effective treatment for it other than the individual body's own immune system. They're not taking any chances.
But for the vast majority of patients, this is not a death sentence when you get a diagnosis. It's basically -- you know, we spoke with an American woman, Rebecca Fraysure, who's in the hospital here. She doesn't even have any symptoms. She's not getting any medication or treatment for the coronavirus.
So, to try to dial back some of the panic that can ensue from these rapidly rising numbers, the captains -- the ship's captain actually saying that this is not unexpected. All of these people were actually exposed before the quarantine period began.
China is doing everything it can to censor information that's coming out about this.
We know that a citizen journalist who had been posting videos from inside Wuhan, kind of exposing what he claimed was the city's lack of preparation and lack of equipment to handle what's happening there. Obviously, the vast majority of deaths have been in Wuhan. He has now disappeared. His family believes the Chinese government put him in forced quarantine and they're very worried about his safety, Laura.
JARRETT: (audio gap) what happened to him there.
Will, thanks so much for being there for us. We'll see you soon.
RIPLEY: Yes.
[05:55:00]
JARRETT: And we want to note, Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas ship docked in New Jersey since Friday, it will set sail today. Passengers began boarding Sunday after four passengers tested negative for coronavirus.
KOSIK: The watchdog for veterans' affairs is reviewing a request to investigate V.A. Sec. Robert Wilkie. Wilkie is accused of seeking dirt on a congressional staffer who alleges she was sexually assaulted. This stems from a complaint by a top aide to California Congressman Mark Takano.
Navy veteran Andrea Goldstein says she was sexually harassed and assaulted at the V.A. Medical Center in Washington last fall. Once she filed a complaint, "The Washington Post" reports Sec. Wilkie began inquiring about her background and encouraging staffers to discredit her. JARRETT: Well, the man who launched two shooting attacks on New York City police officers this weekend says he did it because he hates cops. Police say the first attack took place Saturday on two officers sitting in a van at the 41st Precinct in the Bronx. The second happened the next morning on uniformed officers and a civilian employee inside the precinct.

DERMOT SHEA, COMMISSIONER, NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT: This is not a crime gone bad. This is not a liquor store robbery interrupted that a tragedy erupts from. This is a premeditated assassination attempt.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: The commissioner says in all, two officers were shot but survived. The suspect, 45-year-old Robert Williams, is set to be arraigned later today.
KOSIK: A man is under arrest this morning for driving a van through a tent with Trump campaign volunteers. This happening in Jacksonville, Florida. Gregory Timm facing charges, including aggravated assault. The Jacksonville sheriff says that they're still investigating whether the incident was politically motivated.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
BILL NYE, THE SCIENCE GUY: (Dancing in Blue Jacket Fashion Show).
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Oh, yes, that is Bill Nye, the style guy. Who knew the popular science explainer had those moves? Nye was caught on TikTok dancing down the runway to Lizzo during New York Fashion Week. He was there for the Blue Jacket Fashion Show, an event raising awareness for men's health and prostate cancer treatment.
KOSIK: He is grooving.
Let's get a check on CNN Business this morning. Taking a look at global markets, it looks like Asian markets closed lower and European markets have opened in the red. On Wall Street, futures are pointing to a lower open as well.
Stocks closed lower on Friday despite a strong jobs report, though. The economy added 225,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate edged up to 3.6 percent, but for the right reasons. It's because more people decided to look for work.
The Dow closed down 277 points. That's as investors continue to worry about how the coronavirus will affect the economy. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both closed half a percent lower.
JARRETT: Well, "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" taking jabs at the Democratic field and the conclusion of President Trump's impeachment trial. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
DANIEL SUDEIKIS, ACTOR, PORTRAYING JOE BIDEN ON NBC "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE": By the time we get to South Cackalacky, Joe Biden's going to do what Joe Biden does best, creep up from behind.
LARRY DAVID, ACTOR, PORTRAYING BERNIE SANDERS ON NBC "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE": I have an idea for an app, it's called no apps. No apps, no computers, no gadgets, no gizmos.
You show up to your polling place, take a number like you do at the butcher, they call your ticket. You walk up to the counter and say to the guy, give me a pound of whatever's about to go bad.
KATE MCKINNON, CAST MEMBER, NBC "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", PORTRAYING SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: I know a lot of people like me but they worry about if I'm electable. And I have a great solution for that -- elect me.
RACHEL DRATCH, CAST MEMBER, NBC "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE", PORTRAYING SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: And guess what? Elizabeth is J. Lo and I'm Shakira. And so, to Donald Trump, I say, (imitating Shakira's tongue wag from her performance at the Super Bowl halftime show).
COLIN JOST, CAST MEMBER, NBC "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE": President Trump was acquitted in a Senate trial this week and Democrats are calling it a cover-up. But does this look like a guy who can pull off a cover-up?
(END VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Rachel Dratch as Amy Klobuchar is so good. I love to see all the old "SNL" characters come back.
KOSIK: They are all just killing it. I love it.
JARRETT: They're great -- they're great.
KOSIK: Thanks for joining us. I'm Alison Kosik.
JARRETT: And I'm Laura Jarrett. "NEW DAY" starts right now.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
JARRETT: Tensions run high amongst the candidates just one day before the New Hampshire primary.
SANDERS: I'm running against Pete Buttigieg, among others, who have raised campaign funds from over 40 billionaires.
BUTTIGIEG: I respect Sen. Sanders, but when I hear that you're either for a revolution or you're for the status quo, that's a vision of the country that doesn't have room for most of us.
SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have one job in November, beat Donald Trump.
FONDA: And the Oscar goes to "Parasite." PITT: They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week.
HILDUR GUDNADOTTIR, OSCAR WINNER FOR BEST ORIGINAL SCORE, "JOKER": To the girls who hear the music bubbling within, we need to hear your voices.

Full disclosure: this is not a review about "Parasite," the film created by South Korean director Bong Joon-ho that surprised the world (okay, the white world) by winning Best Picture at the 2020 Oscars. If you would like to see excellent worthy articles on this subject, please consult this link on why the win is significant for the global film industry and this link on the singular beauty of the film itself (written before it was awarded Best Picture).
"Parasite," like most great works of art, is infused with rivets of meaning. It is not designed for mass appeal. It is not a comfortable film. That is why it deserves our attention and respect.
Our world is heaving under the mangles of capitalism, violence and hatred. It is a world of winners and losers. Of popularity. Consumerism. Endless founts of student debt.
The key to conquering this world is usually money. To get money, you must dive headlong into the throes of capitalism-the white man's world.
The patriarchy of success is evident. It is built of thick bricks and cement and a slow-moving poison that worms its way into our books, TV shows, movies and music.
I am, as a white girl, very tired of seeing stories about white people.
I do not care if they are well done. I do not care if Greta Gerwig directed the film, if the acting was perfection itself, if the soundtrack was dreamlike and homey. Please, get off the stage for now.
This is not to say the white woman's plight is of no significance to me. I earnestly believe in the significance of every voice, every story, on this earth. But the white woman's plight, and the white plight in general, has long dominated the popular audience.
Let's make room for diverse stories, new stories. Stories that are not about the world we have always known and worshiped. Stories that do not end with the girl kissing the boy.
The beauty of storytelling and artistry is that every story uncovers its own gold. We tell stories because of their meanings, the stories within the stories. We tell stories to draw a spotlight to something that has perhaps been hiding in the shadows for far too long.
The singular beauty of "Parasite" lies in its autonomy. It weaves themes of class conflict, greed, desire, selfishness and culture together in carefully constructed scenes. It does not apologize for them.
These stories deserve their places in our midst.
The world of subtitles, countries that are not America (yes, other countries do exist) and people who are not Caucasian are the players we have shoved to the side in favor of more Brad Pitt movies and stories about white women feeling trapped into marriages.
There is an entire world out there. Do not wait for the Oscars' stamp of approval to go find it.

From 'Parasite' to 'Minari', South Korea conquered the world in the pandemic

[summary] From "Parasite" to "Minari," South Korean films, songs and series broke through borders and won audiences and awards around the world during the pandemic. Motivated by this strength, reporter tells of his immersion in the cultural life of the country and the experience of learning Korean in quarantine.
      
At the beginning of last year, the prospects of a sweeping "Parasite" oscar win were similar to that of me learning to speak Korean -it would be cool if it happened, but unlikely. A Korean film had never received an award nomination before, and the favorite of that edition was the war epic "1917". However, Bong Joon-ho came out with four trophies, including best picture and director.
Little has remained the same in the world since then. Declared a month after the awards, the Covid-19 pandemic stopped everything: globo soap operas, the Olympics, dreams of traveling on vacation. However, south Korea's cultural industry has not been slowed down, which has only been celebrating since last year.
The ball of the time are the six nominations of "Minari" to the Oscars. Although the film is American-its director, Lee Isaac Chung, born in the United States, the son of immigrants-is almost all spoken in Korean.
For the film, Steven Yeun and Youn Yuh-Jung compete, respectively, for best actor and supporting actress, an unheard-of fact for artists of Asian origin at the awards. Youn is also the favorite, having won the award of the actors' union in the USA and the Bafta, the English Oscar.
In film, TV and music, last year Korea has not stopped pasting stickers on its album of exploits: first Grammy nomination, with the band BTS; first Korean song to reach the top of the Billboard chart, with "Dynamite", sung in English by BTS; first song to reach the top of the Billboard chart sung in Korean, with "Life Goes On", by the same group.
The list of records is also great: according to ifpi (International Federation of the Phonographic Industry), BTS was the world sales champion in 2020. What about the best-selling record? "Map of the Soul: 7", also of them. Last Monday (12), "Dynamite" reached 1 billion views on YouTube, the third time a video of the group reaches this mark.
This cultural strength was key to another unlikely event a year ago: I decided to learn Korean. Social isolation seemed like a unique opportunity to do something unthinkable under normal circumstances-to study a language that did not adopt the Latin alphabet.
Until then, almost nothing knew about South Korea. For years I thought k-pop was just a network of fried chicken restaurants in São Paulo, not the famous one, as I discovered later, Korean pop music genre. The scale swung into the language, however, because of "Parasite". Although he didn't see opportunities to use the language in practice, he could take advantage of quarantine to see other Bong Joon-ho films.
Studying the language only with the help of the internet over the last year has proved, at the same time, a much more difficult and much easier endeacity than I imagined.
On the one hand, if learning English is like starting to ride a bike, learning Korean is being able to piroulate on a bicicross circuit. While the prayers in Portuguese are formed by subject, verb and object, in Korean the object comes before, the verb at the end and the subject often does not even give the faces.
On the other hand, I have noticed that Korea has not been standing out in the cultural scene for nothing. The offer of content in the language is immense, and the country's production scheme seems to have been thought for export.
This is particularly clear in the k-pop industry. In many ways, Korean boybands and girlbands are very fond of Western ones. The groups have members of complementary personalities, present elaborate choreographies, and the releases of records are accompanied by visual changes.
One important difference, however, is the level of accessibility and the amount of content. While American stars such as Beyoncé seem almost unattainable, Korean artists share with fans the minutiae of their work processes and their lives, albeit with a lot of curatorship.
In the first season of the pandemic, when staying at home was still new, musicians like Chris Martin and John Legend made lives to entertain their fans. Watching these broadcasts gave the impression that, yes, stars are like us, and we had a sense of community in the midst of isolation.
In Korea, this power of rapprochement of lives has long been used. V Live allows celebrities to create channels to make live streams, responding to real-time comments. The biggest one, as you can imagine, is BTS, with more than 27 million subscribers who see the band members playing guitar, having lunch or simply doing nothing.
Each anniversary of the singers is celebrated in front of the cameras, each achievement is celebrated with fans. Thus, the audience gets the feeling that they know rm, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook, the band members. And it's a huge audience: in March, a live of Jungkook had over 22 million simultaneous views.
To reach international visitors, V Live also provides subtitles in more than ten languages, including Portuguese and Korean itself, making it a great ally of the language student.
One of the great difficulties in studying the language on your own is the lack of conversation-talking to the dog in Korean was my only alternative, but the advance was nil. Audios made for students, in turn, are artificial, and not all Korean productions on Netflix come with the option of language subtitles.
The lives were the outlet and proved to be a powerful entry drug for k-pop addiction. In a few months I went from "what is BTS?" to "one of them is allergic to potatoes". Jumping from lives to other content was easy, as Korean artists continued to produce during the pandemic, as if nothing had changed.
Part of this is due to the fact that, although vaccination there is also delayed, Korea faced Covid-19 faster than the rest of the world in general, conducting mass tests from the beginning. Thus, it allowed artists to work even in the sharpest periods of the pandemic in the world.
Another determining factor was the adaptability. Each year, for example, the BAND BTS records a reality tour in a different country. As now it was no longer possible, they filmed the isolated singers in the field and released the series "In the Soop". Recordings of a tour became a film and, since they could not perform in person at the Grammys, they replicated in Seoul the theater in which the award was awarded.
In addition, k-pop took the shows to the computer. And not in a stool and guitar scheme: without being able to do a world tour, the female band Blackpink promoted in January a large-scale virtual presentation, with multiple costume changes and pyrotechnics.
Same thing did the BTS. To see one of his virtual shows, with simultaneous translation, 756,000 fans from more than 100 countries bought tickets starting at US$26.
Using these tools, Korea has managed to circumvent obstacles faced by artists who do not speak English in the pursuit of global success. American radio stations are still reluctant to play k-pop, which seemed to be an insurmountable barrier for the genre to reach the top of the Billboard chart. The fan downloads are so many, though, that BTS has succeeded.
This success did not go unnoticed by the Western entertainment industry. From one year to now, it is common to see k-pop stars on American television shows or doing collaborations with artists in the country.
In 2020, the Blackpink quartet recorded "Sour Candy" with Lady Gaga and "Ice Cream" with Selena Gomez. One of the group's singers, Rosé, also became this year the first Korean artist to perform alone on Jimmy Kimmel's traditional American talk show.
And there are deeper cooperations between Korea and the United States underway. In February, Korean entertainment conglomerate HYBE, responsible for BTS, announced a partnership with Universal Music to "rewrite the history of world music."
Together, companies will create a boyband with selected members at global auditions. While Americans will be responsible for music production, marketing and distribution, Koreans will be given the selection and training of singers, as well as the production of content for fans.
This month, HYBE also acquired the company Ithaca Holdings, which manages the careers of the likes of Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato. Bang Si-Hyuk, founder of HYBE, said companies willwork together to "transcend borders and break cultural barriers."
Scooter Braun, leader of Ithaca Holdings and one of the most influential names in The American industry, added: "Global opportunities for artists will grow exponentially with this partnership. It's an opportunity for us to make history, innovate even more in the music industry and revolutionize the game."
Similar movement takes place in the audiovisual. According to CNN, Netflix will nearly double its budget for producing original content in Asia, especially in Korea. The platform doesn't reveal audience numbers, but South Korean series like "Itaewon Class," "Kingdom," "All Right Not To Be Normal," as well as bombing on Twitter, have won rave reviews in the U.S. media -the latter two were cited by The New York Times among the best international series of 2020.
Last year, Netflix also began a partnership with Korean media company JTBC and producer Studio Dragon for distribution and co-production of series.
On Apple TV, it is in pre-production "Pachinko", a book-based series of the same name that tells the saga of a Korean family for generations. With international cast, it will be spoken in Korean, English and Japanese.
Since there is no release date yet, I can dream that, until then, I will understand about 70% of the dialogues. Learning Korean -or at least starting with-was a roller coaster that accompanied the pandemic. In the first few weeks, when staying at home it seemed like something out of this world, but fleeting, it was reasonably simple.
Several sites teach the alphabet, consisting of 21 vowels and 19 consonants, and on YouTube you can learn to emit the sounds that do not exist in the Portuguese language -in Korean there are no sounds of F or V, but there are many others that we do not do (it is easy, for example, to say "defecate" instead of "buy", which makes it difficult to acquire pants).
The following months of learning grammar were an escalation. For six months, studying one hour a day, nine levels of the wonderful (and free, basic) course on the Talk To Me In Korean website were completed-a total of 270 lessons.
There was also the period of the decoreba, in which daily he recorded in a slate six new words and recorded the memorized in an application. At night, he recited verbs until he got to sleep.
Without the series, the music and the movies, however, it would have been impossible. From them I learned that in Korea, you don't have your birthday, but on New Year's Eve, and that everyone is born a year old-so there you are one or two years older than here. I also found that it is common for couples with children to call themselves "So-and-So's father" or "Sicrano's mother", rather than using their own names. That made it easier.
Korea is well known to the potential of its culture to popularize the country around the world. HYBE, for example, has launched with other institutions the Learn Korean course with BTS, which uses group videos to teach the language at international universities.
This wave also caused internal changes in the country. In December, a law was passed that allows popstars to delay their military enlistment by two years, mandatorily complied with by all men up to the age of 28 -age of the oldest member of BTS, Jin.
Despite recent achievements, however, the Korean cultural wave has challenges ahead. Blackpink fans, for example, were disappointed not to see the band on the list of nominees for the Grammy reveal, although the quartet sets a record after record.
The barrier of subtitles, cited by filmmaker Bong Joon-ho in one of his awards speeches for "Parasite" last year, also persists. Even "Minari" was affected: United States production and story about the American dream, could not compete as best drama film at the Golden Globes.
Speaking in Korean, it was embedded in the foreign film category, causing discussion on the internet, since feature films such as "Babel" and "Inglório bastards" also contained dialogues in more than one language and disputed the main categories.
On Oscar Sunday, the 25th, I'll be, like a year ago, rooting for Korea. The chance of another big win may be minimal, but if we've learned anything in the last year it's that the unlikely often happens. With the Covid-19, it seems that everything repeats itself as tragedy and as a farce, but there are also some small gains.
If the latest results are indicative of what Korea can do in the future, I may have more opportunities than I thought to put into practice the language learned. In the end, Korean culture and language have been a good mental escape valve for the past 12 months, but I hope that next time I can learn a new language without going through a pandemic.

Parasite: Black & White Version review - horror with a shade of Ealing comedy; Cinephile's treat or ticket-peddling gimmick? Either way, this monochrome edition puts the masterful satire in a new light

There's a moment in Terry Zwigoff's 1994 documentary about R           obert Crumb when the cartoonist leans over his teenage son, tweaks the colour on TV so the film he's watching becomes black and white, and says: "There! Isn't that better?"
Maybe. Audiences might be wary of special black and white presentations of new movies. Bong Joon-ho's award-winning Parasite is now getting this treatment, which in 2016 was also conferred on Mad Max: Fury Road with a "black and chrome" edition.
Is this "luxury arthouse" monochrome experience a genuine way of enhancing or adding to the film? Or merely a snob marketing ploy, gouging repeat box-office business from an existing fanbase on the fallacious assumption that black and white is somehow classier and more artistic than colour? Would anyone for example, dare offer a colourised version of a new black-and-white movie? Roger Deakins shot the Coens' The Man Who Wasn't There on colour film stock and then corrected it to black and white. Perhaps it is possible to show that in colour. But would it find favour on the same basis? I remember the old colourisation debate from the 1970s, when my parents' old black and white TV was incidentally offering a connoisseur's monochrome presentation of The Wizard Of Oz and also of BBC Two's Pot Black, with the snooker balls in exquisitely nuanced gunmetal shades.
It does have to be said that there is a real fascination in seeing Parasite through the monochrome lens, and it has a certain crystalline beauty - but then it did in colour. It's invigorating to see this tremendous film again on any basis, in a way that goes some way to restoring the shock of the new. At the Berlin film festival last month, an industry executive asked me if I thought black and white would help Parasite's CGI effects. After a short pause, she had to break it to me that those fierce colours in the garden were not entirely natural and nobody was falling down the cellar stairs for real.
So here we are again, with the cheeky Fagin-style charlatan family - loafer dad (Song Kang-ho), grumpy mum (Chang Hyae-jin), moody teen son (Choi Woo-sik) and smart daughter (Park So-dam) - living in a squalid semi-basement flat and sensing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get rich. When the son is engaged as a tutor for a rich kid (Jung Ji-so) from a privileged family who live in a colossal modernist house in the posh part of town, he sees how he can get his entire clan employed there too, pretending to be unrelated strangers. The daughter gets to tutor the kid brother (Jung Hyun-jun) in art, the mum ousts the existing housekeeper and the dad takes over the driver's job. And all the time, the naïve mistress of the house (Cho Yeo-chong) and her overworked husband Mr Park (Lee Syun-kun) get the wool pulled over their eyes, until everyone realises that another terrifying trick is being played on all of them.
Bong has said the advantage of black and white is that it allows the performances to come across more strongly. For me, that isn't quite it. The performances came across quite superbly enough in colour - the monochrome advantages and disadvantages lie elsewhere. In the opening section of the film, seeing the family's scuzzy and ineffably yucky flat in black-and-white gives it an intriguingly kitchen-sinky, Brit social-realist look that it didn't have before, especially when the son and daughter hunch together over that nasty lavatory that is raised on to the flat's chaotic "mezzanine" level. And when the whole place is submerged in smoke from the fumigation official, the resulting fog is hilariously stylised, as if Nosferatu is going to emerge from the mist.
And in fact, when all their con-trick shenanigans start to kick off in earnest, the black-and-white Parasite emphasises another Brit dimension that I'd only vaguely sensed from the original: an Ealing comedy.
It's when the action moves to the wealthy household that things become less satisfying. We don't see the house's magnificent d           ecor in all its richness and out in the garden, the vivid blue of the sky and rich green of the grass are no longer. When violence erupts, the splashes of blood are less overtly shocking in grey. (But then this is why Scorsese preferred            Raging Bull in black and white.)
Yet it is too reductive to say that only the "lower-class" parts of Parasite are better in black and white. Monochrome gives something very elegant to the Park family's illuminated glass crockery cabinets positioned either side of the cellar door, replaced later with wine bottles and glasses. And there is something very queasy and dreamlike in seeing the final bloodbath in black and white. It's a different sort of queasiness and dreaminess than the colour version ... but not necessarily better.
There is something very startling about this specialist monochrome-flavour version of Parasite. It gave me a renewed appetite to watch the film all over again. In colour.
Parasite: Black & White Version screens on 5 March at the Glasgow film festival, and is released in the UK on 3 April

2019's socially-aware thriller of the year: 'Parasite'

In every country, there's poverty. But wherever there's poverty, wealth can be found nearby. Sometimes, this wealth can be found only as a dream in the minds of the poor; sometimes, it can literally be seen down the block in a stunning luxury mansion with a lovely lawn of green grass. In Bong Joon-ho's gripping, powerful new film, "Parasite," wealth is found in both places.
"Parasite," set in South Korea, tells the story of the impoverished Kim family. Father, mother, son and daughter live together in a dingy, cramped basement apartment, pilfering their neighbor's wifi, struggling to make ends meet and constantly searching for a new way to make money while relying on their filial bonds to sustain them. Their golden ticket to prosperity falls in the hands of son Kim Ki-woo (Choi woo-sik), who lands a job tutoring for the daughter of the affluent Park family.
The Parks - a family with a businessman father, housewife mother, teenage daughter and rambunctious son - live in the aforementioned luxury mansion, a stunning piece of modern architecture with a lovely yard. As Ki-woo gets into the family's good graces, he cunningly finds jobs for his father, mother and sister in the Park household, although the wealthy family has no idea they're all related. The families develop a symbiotic relationship: the Kims have found a steady stream of income, a way out of poverty and the Parks have all their needs - cooking, cleaning, driving, etc. - taken care of in the way that only an extravagantly rich family can.
But this isn't a happy movie or a rags-to-riches story. This is a Bong Joon-ho movie. His 2013 film, "Snowpiercer," tackles class struggles by adding a whole lot of violence and conflict to a fantasy world, and "Parasite" does it by adding suspense and horror to the real world. The film takes a turn in the third act too good to spoil in a review - you'll have to watch this one yourself. The final act is as gruesome as it is crushing, a fitting end to the roller coaster ride of emotion that is the second half of the film.
"Parasite" lies somewhere between drama and horror; there's one genuinely creepy scene that'll be giving me nightmares for a while, but an overall lack of jump scares and monsters in the dark. It doesn't have the pure terror of "Hereditary" or a twist as totally wild as "Get Out." Still, "Parasite" ramps up the suspense in a few key moments while letting the overarching question - Can the Kims maintain their relationship with and hide their secret from the Parks to escape poverty? - inject the whole film with a feeling of anxiety. It's gripping from beginning to end, all while delivering a powerful message on timely social issues like poverty, class resentment and wealth inequality.
"Parasite" was a huge hit in South Korea and has received acclaim at film festivals worldwide, winning the Palme d'Or, the highest award at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. It debuts in theaters across the U.S. on Oct. 31 - it's a good Halloween flick - and will likely be in contention for an Academy Award in February. If you want to stay in-the-know when it comes to trendy films in 2019 and also just see a great movie, you should definitely watch "Parasite."

Movie: "Parasite"
Release Date: Nov. 8, 2019
Director: Bong Joon-Ho
Runtime: 2 hours 12 minutes
Genre: Comedy, crime, drama
Rating: A+
In the past, foreign films have completely evaded mainstream culture and appreciation. This year, however, the film "Parasite" has received immense critical acclaim. The first-ever foreign film to win a Screen Actors Guild award, it has clearly reached a broader audience.
"Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films," Bong Joon-Ho, the director of "Parasite," said when he accepted the award for his film.
For most, the thought of watching a film that is not only in a foreign language but also comprised of almost entirely foreign composition is understandably daunting. However, if approached with an open mind, this confusion will turn into appreciation for Joon-Ho's story. An attitude of enthusiasm and attentiveness will succeed in both evoking emotions and telling an important story of humanity, class, love and wealth.
It is not a classic story of action or adventure, but it is an artistic piece that comments on human struggle through its characters. Joon-Ho's subtle and direct choices for the settings, the haunting imagery and the compelling and relatable dialogue are all so captivating.
The complex characters that are simultaneously deceptive thieves and lovable humans suffer the injustices of everyday people. The story reveals aspects of humanity like disgust, annoyance, pity and love through these characters.
All the components of this film, even in their total estrangement, are still accessibly human because of how interesting the development of the story is. Similar to movies like "Snowpiercer" or "Okja," this film remains colorful and complex while also portraying simple themes of humanity and simultaneously a story of the darker sides of the world. The camera angles, the subtleties in dialogue, the coloring of the shots, the symmetry and geometry of the scenery create something of an intensely human thriller full of gritty components and beautiful coloring.
Once the viewer accepts the South Korean influence and begins to identify with the story, it becomes a beautiful human tale of deep, thematic traits and is representative of the common struggles of peoples in all areas of the world. The experience is more than worthy to view this uniquely painted essay on humanity shown through dirty characters and a colorfully bloody film.

Story: A poor, unemployed family play out a well-laid plan to secure jobs for themselves in a wealthy household, only to unleash a series of unexpected events.  Review: 'Parasite's' opening shot of a small glass window looking up from a basement house to the view of a narrow winding road, sets the visual language of the film firmly, right at the onset. There are many more such shots which metaphorically convey the social and economic disparity that is the central theme of this film. Especially the use of stairs going up and down, cramped spaces versus lush, open green lawns, delectably and elegantly laid out fruit slices as opposed to a heaped plate of an assortment of food from a local kitchen. 
Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family live in a pokey, underground house and are generally unemployed. When we meet them, the family is perturbed that their access to free wifi has been cut short. Obviously not able to afford their own, they have been sponging off their neighbor's connection. In fact, even as a fumigation carried out on their street, Kim tells his family to leave the windows open so they can have a free extermination of the insects in their house, despite almost choking on the fumes. On some days, they get by with temporary jobs like fixing pizza boxes. So when his son Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is offered by a friend to be set up as an English tutor to the daughter of a wealthy Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), he agrees. Only hitch, Kim Ki-woo doesn't have a college degree having failed his university exams. But his sister, Kim Ki-jeong (Park So-dam) presents a quick solution to this with her expert artistic and photo-shopping skills. Armed with a forged degree document, Kim makes an easy impression on Mr.Park's wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong) and their teenage daughter, Park Da-hye (Jung ji-so). There's also their nine-year-old son, Park Da-song (Jung Hyeong), scampering around the house, who Yeon-kyo believes has untapped artistic talents. With one foot firmly inside the Park household, Kim Ki-jeong craftily places his sister as Da-song's art teacher cum therapist. Yeon-kyo is naivety and gullible nature makes this inclusion quite smooth. Soon with some careful scheming, fake identities and a well-rehearsed plan even his parents, Kim Ki-taek and Chung sook (Chang Hyae-jin) are employed in the household.  It seems like a flawless plan with the Kim family settled into their new found roles and the sunlit, lavish mansion of the Park's giving the perfect backdrop. But just like that, director Bong Joon-ho's screenplay springs upon us unexpected plot twists and a thrilling run up to a grisly yet astounding climax. Through a well-crafted maze of events the prevalent class conflict and social disparity come to the fore. The Kim's are often shown huddled together as a family, gobbling away at their meals and the Park's are often in their own expansive rooms, almost isolated from each other. In a telling scene, when Mr. Park discusses Mr.Kim's smell that wafts through the car when he drives, 'crossing the line' and reaching the backseat, he describes it as an 'old rag that has been boiled' and 'that smell that people who travel in the subway have'. It's evident there is unspoken disdain is on both ends, as Chung sook quips how Yeon-kyo is 'nice because she is rich.' With not a moment that seems unnecessary or extra, 'Parasite' is exceptionally well-paced and edited (Yang Jin-mo). Director Bong Jon-ho is in complete command as he masterfully constructs stylized, dramatic sequences set to a brilliant background score (Jung Jae-il). The ensemble cast enhance the proceedings with superlative performances, especially Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik.  With an insightful and searing exploration of human behavior, 'Parasite' is a masterfully crafted film that is a definite must watch.  For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com

Barking Dogs Never Bite review - Bong Joon-ho's canine satire has teeth; Lazy, corrupt humans are doing the biting in the Parasite director's re-released 2000 film

Star Rating: 4 stars
Bong Joon-ho's black-comic satire Barking Dogs Never Bite has been re-released after 20 years, and in many ways it could be seen as a thematic forerunner to his Oscar-winning hit Parasite, with its vision of strange people and strange secrets in a basement. But it's entirely distinctive on its own (bizarre) terms: a film about animal cruelty (loosely inspired by the 19th-century children's novel A Dog of Flanders by Marie Louise de la Ramée, perennially popular in Korea) and it begins with a huge "no animals were harmed" disclaimer. As well it might. The various moments of dog-jeopardy and dog-distress will have you hiding under your seat - and a certain dog rescue scene is like something out of The Shining.
Lee Sung-jae plays Yun-ju, a hapless postgrad student with a pregnant partner. The pair live in a crumbling apartment building whose front doors open outwards - which is to be important in one chase scene. Yun-ju's worries are compounded when he realises that he is expected to pay a hefty bribe to the elderly faculty professor to get a tenure-track job.
The combination of financial anxiety and disillusionment triggers a mental breakdown and he becomes obsessed with a dog in a neighbouring flat whose incessant barking is driving him mad. He decides he has no choice but to kill the unfortunate animal. In fact, his misdeeds are to involve three dogs and bring him into fateful contact with an administrator called Hyun-nam (Bae Doona) who has to press an official stamp on all "Lost Dog" notices. The movie is by turns wacky, farcical and grimly realist. The dogs might bark, but the ones doing the biting are the humans: the lazy, venal, corrupt, depressed, greedy people who have no one but themselves to blame for living a dog's life. 
•	Barking Dogs Never Bite is available online through Curzon Home Cinema from Friday, and screens on Saturday at Camden Market in London.

Lights dimmed in movie theatres across the globe late last year as rooms were lit up by Bong Joon-ho's most critically acclaimed film, "Parasite," with the first shot panning down to the initial glimpse of the Kim family's home. Little did viewers know the ingeniously crafted social satire was to become an award-winning motion picture.

The smell of the film's success is something that movie fanatics are unfamiliar with, considering that it was written and filmed in Korean. But, unlike the Park family's reaction to the Kim kin's odor - a theme that proved to be definitive in later parts of the story - the South Korean film was unapologetically celebrated in all of its glory. 
With the rising recognition of foreign films in American culture, accompanied by a leap toward overcoming the English-speaking community's fear of subtitles, "Parasite" swept four Oscars on Sunday night, on top of being recognized with hundreds of other awards and nominations. 
To put the cherry on top, "Parasite" also made history by being the first non-English film to receive the Best Picture title in the Academy Awards' 92-year run. 
The movie has even been approved by the strict critics of Rotten Tomatoes, as it currently has a 99% rating on the Tomatometer. Clearly, they can recognize the real deal when it's in front of them, a skill the Park family lacked when welcoming their newest recruits into their home.
"Parasite" exists as a comment on classism, following the Kims' penetration into a wealthy, yet clueless, household. Money can indeed buy comfort, but the Parks outdid themselves by falling host to the impoverished family.
Kim Ki-woo, played by Woo-sik Choi, was the first to infiltrate the Park's modernistic home, previously built and inhabited by the infamous fictional architect Namgoong Hyeonja. Ki-woo lucked out in having the connection that he did, because if it wasn't for his friend, Min, played by Seo-joon Park, Ki-woo would not have experienced the luxury of living above ground. 
As Ki-woo and his family scheme to get each member a job under the Parks' roof, their actions become more twisted and their morals less clear. With each con the Kims pull off, viewers begin to question where to draw the line between right and wrong, and Ki-woo begins to lose his grasp of reality as he fantasizes about having Min's life. 
Though Min's role was minimal, it was far from insignificant. Min is the catalyst for the Kims' connection to the Parks, as well as the figure of economic prestige that Ki-woo aspires to be. Even toward the end of the film, audiences can juxtapose the stark contrast between Min, an affluent university student, to Ki-woo, a wasted talent with the mind, but not the money, to climb out of his family's lower-class status. 
Ki-woo's hopes that his family will one day live upstairs are the figurative insect blocking his better judgment, and completely deplete him of his ethical compass. But, a parasite can only survive as long as its host remains healthy; that biological concept stands within nature as much as it does in class warfare. As Ki-woo falls into a downward spiral, his parasitic thoughts consequently follow suit.
Joon-ho does an immaculate job blending elements of comedy, crime, drama and horror into the film. He does it so well that the audience does not realize the damage that has been done until the Kims come face to face with the initial parasites of the Namgoong home. In an effort to protect their family's recent employment, occupations that are as sturdy as the lies they're based on, the Kims' actions come to symbolize the lower class's desperation for a better life.
When writing the story, Joon-ho said he experienced an epiphany that allowed him to conjure up the film's ironic and heart-wrenching conclusion: there will never be an end to economic disparity. Even though Ki-woo has legitimate talents, his forged resume represents that he is merely a fraud who is attempting to survive in a materialistic society. 
No amount of comedic relief in the first half of the film could have prepared viewers for the surprise that was to come knocking on their doors that fateful night, ominously accompanied by rain and the stench of desperation. On the same night that the Kims' temporary comfort was disrupted, a rainstorm terrorized their neighborhood as their semi-basement home was flooded with dirty water and the guilt of the sins they have committed.
The film's set design is reflective of the story's layers. Overlapping genres, themes and hierarchies were built into the house to show the film's complex elements struggling to coexist. Joon-ho emphasizes the metaphoric connotation of having levels within the house, between the rich and poor neighborhoods, and in the camera angles. 
The film concludes with a scene panning down from the Kims' basement window onto Ki-woo's futile hopes, mirroring the opening scene which is now tainted with despair and the acknowledgment of unachievable dreams. When the theater's lights came back on, movie-goers had no choice but to applaud the agonizing yet brilliant cinematic masterpiece that is "Parasite."

2020 Oscar Awards: The Secrets of "Parasite," the film that can make history

Parasite, the film-feeling of the season, another unclassifiable cross-genre jumping game by Bong Joon-Ho, the Korean director of the magnificent Memories of murder and The Host, has already won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, took home-building the award SAG Awards and will compete in six categories at the Academy Awards.
She is nominated as one of the leading candidates to stay on Sunday with the award for best film: in case that happens, it would be the first unspoken feature film in English to achieve it. The only antecedent was El Artista, the French film that managed to win the statuette in 2012, but there its actors did not speak, and ended up being a tribute to silent cinema that found its years of rise in the early Hollywood industry.
Last year this race was played by Roma, the film of the Mexican Alfonso Cuarón that told the life of Cleo, a domestic employee set in the Roma neighborhood of Mexico City. This film, spoken in Spanish and Mixtec, shot in black and white, had an aggravating for the Academy: it was a production of Netflix, the streaming giant. It was one thing to give him an award as a foreign film, and quite another to give him the power of the big screen. That's how Green Book took the Oscar, much to the discontent of many.
Parasite may feel far away to the United States when we consider that it portrays families living thousands of miles from where the American dream is built. Awarding the prize to this production would involve a before and after in the most important award of world cinema.

In this film Ki-taek is the patriarch of a poor family that lives on a low floor in Seoul and survives on precarious work. The life of this humble clan will change radically when the son gets a job as an English teacher for a child in an upper-class house. We are not looking at a case of a film that is difficult to see and understand, nor that it encloses high artistic issues for those who do not belong to that niche. Parasite could perfectly be a popular American, French or Argentine film. It does not belong to indie cinema (independent and low budget); on the contrary, it has so far raised about $140 million, and goes for much more.
For those who never saw anything about Bong Joon-Ho, a movie like Parasite will be totally surprising. Those who, on the other hand, know this filmmaker, will appreciate in Parasite tones and themes very typical of one of the most important directors of contemporary cinema. To locate this director throughout his career, he has so far made seven feature films and belongs to a generation of new filmmakers from South Korea that have emerged since the mid-1990s.
In all these cases there is a strong imprint of political and social cinema, an interest that in the case of Bong Joo-Ho connects even with his own academic title (before dedicating himself to film graduated as a sociologist). Within these social interests, what persists most is a personal look at power relations. Not only because in his cinema there are tensions of class or authority (which most of the time is the same thing), but because more than once that power manifests itself awkwardly and even unconsciously. A clear example of this is in The Host. What stands out is that military forces can not only be cruel, but may lackall common sense and surrender to the obedience of a greater power (in this case that of the United States) without squeaking. In Memoirs of a Killer, for example, small-town policemen use confessions via torture not only because of a context of widespread violence (the film takes place during a right-wing dictatorship suffered by South Korea in the 1980s), but because they lack too much intelligence, and even in Okja the main villains present theself as a set of grotesque people who end up being overtaken in cunning by a teenage girl.
Of course, so much emphasis on the improbability or ignorance of certain characters results in more than one occasion when Bong's cinema uses, and much, satire and humor. But it is also true that the stupidity or ignorance of some of his characters is not only comical but also harmful and tragic. And this is where we enter one of the most amazing features of its cinema: its unpredictability. Whoever enters Bong Joon-Ho's world enters a universe where it seems that anything can happen. His cinema is rich in narrative twists, and abrupt record changes that make it quickly move from the comical to the terrible. However, the interesting thing about your cinema is that these record changes, while looking rough at first glance, end up revealing as logical when you review the film or even finish thinking about it. I mean, Bong's cinema may be unpredictable, but this unpredictability is never free. Deep down, it ends up being a hopeful consequence, sometimes even logical both by the environment in which their characters live and by their own decisions.
"Parasite" could perfectly be a popular American, French or Argentine film. It does not belong to indie cinema (independent and low budget); on the contrary, it has so far raised about $140 million, and goes for much more
Parasite is a perfect example of the latter aspect. Its plot revolves around a marginal family group in South Korea that uses the scam to gradually inhabit the home of a wealthy family. Their strategy will be that, progressively, each family member is occupying a different position, both from the servitude and the particular teaching staff of his children. At some point, Parasite is thematically twinned with two particularly resonant American films from last year: Us, by Jordan Peele, and especially Joker, by Todd Phillips. All these feature films have in common a similar idea: to present ourselves with a society divided into two very marked social classes, of which the lowest are furious and eager to occupy more privileged places, and the highest completely ignorant of what's happening with the most unfortunate sectors.
However, there is one thing that makes Parasite very different from the other two: people who occupy privileged places are not shown at any time with contempt. Their petty attitudes, while they may exist, not necessarily make them horrible villains or even bad people, but simply people who were lucky enough to be born in peaceful places where they could build a much better future. In any case, what gave them that privileged life is a world surrounded by a bubble of happiness that turned them into very naive people tocertain things, which do not know who are the people who entered your home or fully know each corner of your own home.

Oscar Best Picture 'Parasite's Metamorphosis At The Box Office: Bong Joon Ho Pic Heading To $40M+
Deadline
February 10, 2020

Length: 626 words

While a post-Oscars box office boost was already expected for Bong Joon Ho's            Parasite tonight even with Best International Film and Best Director wins, now with a Best Picture win, the pic has a shot to go into the $40M-plus zone, possibly even more. The            NEON release, after winning the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival repped the first Best Picture win for a foreign language movie at the Oscars, with a grand total of four wins including Joon Ho and Jin Wan Hoon.
Box office sources believe that if U.S. distributor NEON spends more on ads (and they have every reason to), the final domestic tally for Parasite has a shot of surging 25% following tonight's win, becoming potentially the 4th highest grossing foreign-language film of all-time, overtaking Eugenio Derbez's Instructions Not Included ($44.4M), and filing behind Sony Pictures Classics' 4x Oscar winner Crouching Tiger, Miramax's 3x Oscar winner Life Is Beautiful ($57.2M), and Miramax's Hero ($53.7M).
Parasite is currently booked at 1,060 runs in 174 markets, and grossed $1.5M over this weekend for a total today of $35.4M. Since Oscar noms were announced on Jan. 13, Parasite has surged 39% in its total cume since noms making a solid $10M over that period. Parasite has passed Miramax's top grossing French film Amelie ($33.2M) and should soon overtake Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth ($37.6M) which is currently the fifth highest foreign language film of all-time at the domestic B.O.
The pic, fueled by its critical momentum and the growing fanbase of Joon Ho, has become an anomaly for a foreign pic at the B.O., feasibly becoming the highest grossing South Korea release of all-time stateside. Parasite became the highest grossing Palme D'Or winner in France and North America in 15 years since the release of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004 ($119.1M domestic, $222.4M worldwide). Prior to Parsite, Joon Ho made the $70M feature Okja for Netflix, which got a world premiere at Cannes in 2017. The explosion of Parasite at the B.O. further underscores the power of specialty films on the big screen, both commercially and culturally, as streamers invade the space.
Even though Universal/Amblin/New Republic's 1917 lost the big prize, many believe the pic stands to final at $150M domestic, repping a 13% jump following tonight's ceremony where it won best VFX, Cinematography and Sound Mixing. Since Oscar noms were announced on Jan. 13, the Sam Mendes-directed WWI feature (which is told in one continuous shot) has seen a 210% gain in its total box office to date. Amazing. Last year, Universal/Participant/Amblin's Green Book saw a 22% jump in its domestic box office post Oscars for a final take of $85M stateside.

Even though the nom season shrunk by two weeks, those Oscar Best Picture nominees still in theaters saw sizeable gains since nom day with Fox Searchlight's Jojo Rabbit at $30.3M, +37% and Sony's Little Women at $102.6M, +37%. Jojo Rabbit won best adapted screenplay tonight for its filmmaker and star Taika Waititi, while Little Women won Best Costumes.
Over the last five years, Oscar Best Picture winners have seen a +17% post ceremony average surge in their domestic ticket sales. The biggest percent jump since 2015 was for A24's Moonlight which increased 25% between Oscars and the end of its run, with a final domestic of $25M.

"Parasite" explores growing dichotomy between rich and poor

A Review of the Oscar-winning phenomenon, "Parasite" 
On the surface, South Korean filmmaker Bong-Joon Ho's "Parasite" is simply a comedic thriller.  Once dissected, it becomes evident that a class hierarchy dominates every aspect of the movie and its characters lives. 
The success of "Parasite" at the 94th Oscars proved that Ho's brilliant work on class differentiation did not go unnoticed by industry peers. A slow progression of a poor family working for a rich family is where the movie derives its name, "Parasite," as both leech off of each other in order to survive. 
The storyline of "Parasite" centers on struggles that the poor Kim family and the rich Park family each experience. The Kim family work at menial labor jobs and lament about their unfortunate life. One day the family's fortune changes when the poor son is presented with a prosperity stone and is offered the opportunity to tutor the rich family's high school daughter. 
The son's entry into the Park's affluent life provides him with opportunities to get the rest of his family jobs working for the rich Park family. The poor sister becomes an art therapist/counselor for the Park family's young son. The father is hired as Mr. Park's valet/driver. Mrs. Kim lands the coveted position as the Park's housekeeper after employing some dastardly machinations to oust the current long-time housekeeper. 
Both the rich and poor families are helpless without each other. This is evident when the naive Mrs. Park tries to cook and clean and Mr. Parks says his wife is an awful housekeeper. Mrs. Parks relies on her hired help to help her run the household and maintain her social status.
The true nature of the narrative is revealed when it starts to rain. The rain acts as a metaphor to accentuate the differences between the rich and the poor. To the rich, the deluge of water is viewed as a welcome act that is needed to wash away the city's grime, filth, and unpleasant odor that emanates from the "the poor". 
Meanwhile, the deluge has the opposite effect for the Kim family.  The Kim's family home is flooded and their belongings destroyed. While everything they own is ruined by the deluge of sewage, the rich remain unaffected and indifferent to how much the storm costs others. 
The movie's message doesn't stop there. The undercurrent digs even deeper to reveal how both the rich and poor need one another to survive. The old housekeeper brings back secrets to the house that shatter the integrated life of the Kims. The true cost of keeping up such a life of feeding off the rich is revealed. 
Parasite is a testament to the beauty of cleverly written characters working within a complex storyline. There is no one character in "Parasite" because they all dynamically work together to drive the plot.
The film cleverly interweaves a comedic storyline that is essentially about the symbiotic relationship of survival and interdependence between the haves and have-nots. The ending cleverly depicts how society exploits wealth inequality. The rich family solves their problem by moving on while the poor must figure a way out of their financial prison.

Movie Marketing Insiders Talk Rotten Tomatoes, 'Parasite' Success and Online Haters

Highlight: Universal, Participant, Neon and Google executives gathered at Clio Entertainment's Creative Fest for a lively discussion on all things movie marketing, including their most valuable career lessons, such as "Nobody knows anything."

Is Cats actually going to be good? What are best practices when it comes to calming online haters? How did Parasite break through the clutter to become one of the year's biggest box office surprises? Do movie marketers love, hate or love to hate Rotten Tomatoes?
Those were just a few of the subjects covered during "Marketing Masterminds Roundtable: How to Break Through the Noise," a Wednesday afternoon featured panel during Clio Entertainment's Creative Fest at NeueHouse Hollywood. Moderated by The Hollywood Reporter's editorial director, Matthew Belloni, it featured Dwight Caines, co-president of domestic marketing at Universal; Christina Kounelias, president of worldwide marketing at Participant; Tom Quinn, founder and CEO of Neon; and Angie Barrick, head of industry, media and entertainment at Google.
The first question Belloni tossed to the group at the event - billed as "a community gathering that celebrates the art of entertainment marketing to create superfans around the globe," presented in partnership with THR - was their take on the year's biggest big-screen surprises, successes or failures. Caines quipped that he knows well enough "never to speak about other people's failures," so instead he talked about his studio's recent success Good Boys. The performance of director Gene Stupnitsky's August release proved, to Caines, that "the R-rated comedy is viable."
"We went into the campaign not fully knowing if we could get it done," he said. "It was surprising that we were able to break through." He chalked the win up to multiple factors, including "some key art that was just extraordinary" that told the story in an effective way, including bold red coloring and the tagline "You must be this tall to see this movie." The film opened to $21 million and has done more than $110 globally, he said. 
Kounelias turned her attention to Quinn and his company, praising their handling of Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite and how the indie distributor created a "must-see" event that she called a cultural touchpoint. "They've done an amazing job with that," she said. "It just popped. ... It feels urgent and strikes a lot of chords."
"How did you do that, Tom?" Belloni asked Quinn, who gave a layered answer that ended with him giving full credit to the filmmaker. He said Bong Joon-Ho went to Cannes with the idea of asking journalists and fans not to include spoilers in their coverage, something that was largely respected by everyone. Quinn added that the veteran filmmaker is intimately involved in the marketing process. "Every single frame of this campaign has been signed off on by Bong. Bong is a huge film fan. He loves the poster and trailer and just as much as he loves making the movie," Quinn said. "All of that together, working together with the filmmaker, helped inform the campaign."
The group then spent a fair amount of time on the day's buzziest topic: Rotten Tomatoes. Belloni wanted to know how it influences moviegoers today, and if that has changed in recent years. "I love Rotten Tomatoes," Kounelias said before quickly adding that her company's next release - Todd Haynes' Dark Waters - is currently sitting with a glowing 94 percent. "It's a useful shorthand. It's the modern-day version of [two thumbs up]." 
Quinn got some laughs when he said that he used to loathe the rating system aggregated from critic reviews, but now that Neon has a lot of movies in the top 20 of the year, "I love it." He said Neon has used the 99 percent Rotten Tomatoes rating for Parasite and Apollo 11  in marketing materials by putting it "front and center."
"It's one more wonderful third-party affirmation that we desperately seek," Quinn continued. He did say, however, that he believes rival Metacritic will one day "be more impactful," because "it's definitely more accurate," as it relies on a more curated group of critics. That said, "There is true merit to a Rotten Tomatoes score."
Caines entered the debate with the disclaimer that Universal owns Rotten Tomatoes. With that out of the way, he said he agreed with Kounelias that the service provides a shorthand. "We like it and good matters," he said, after explaining that one casualty is that it has taken the need to read thoughtful analysis and whittled it down to a juicy red tomato of approval or a negative green splat. That said, "We can survive a bad Rotten Tomatoes score if we have a movie that is a crowd pleaser."
Belloni then broached the subject of online backlash and asked the panelists how they determine when to respond to criticism of films and/or specific creative decisions. For example, he noted how Paramount responded after the studio weathered criticism over the look of the title character in its upcoming Sonic the Hedgehog film. Caines applauded Paramount's decision, particularly because he grew up with a Sega Genesis and considers himself a fan boy. "That was a smart move," he added.
Tony Ung
Kounelias, who worked with Caines and his team on the Oscar-winning Green Book, said they received lots of feedback about that film during its long awards season haul. She said marketers don't necessarily have to act in response to "whatever the thing" is at the moment. "Stay ahead of the audience," she said. "Be with them. Be one of them. That's where the art comes in with the science. You have to understand what's happening culturally, emotionally with people and how you are relating to them, and what they want from you. They often want a relationship."
Barrick jumped in with a point about how Google picks up on what the audience wants by digging through comments as well as seeing where users may rewind and replay specific moments in trailers. For example, she said after the launch of the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood trailer, analytics showed a large number of people were zeroing in on the Bruce Lee scene. "The amount of rewinding that happened for Bruce Lee was really incredible for us to see," she said.
Speaking of trailers, Caines addressed the phenomenon that is the Cats trailer, a subject initially brought up by Belloni. "The response to Cats is that it's tracking just like Cats the musical. It's a very polarizing property," he said, before defending what he's seen as the opposite of what many critics or skeptics believe it will be. He called the finished film delightful. "It's a dance movie. It's really great family entertainment. The cast is amazing."
Even if it may take a beat for audiences to accept the latter. "The first time I saw the movie, they weren't cats, they were people. It was like seeing the characters from Avatar, or the way people reacted to Will Smith as the Genie [in Aladdin]. It took a couple beats, and then you were in."
Quinn said the Cats trailer was a big subject in his office, as well. "It is so much fun to hate on that trailer, and there's a pocket of people in my office who are going to go out as a group and see it," he said.
It hits theaters Dec. 20, a date that puts it "intentionally" up against the new Star Wars installment, Caines added. "We have an audience in mind for that movie, and we are very bullish about it," he said. "As a marketer, you have to know who you are speaking to and have a strong flavor and go after that audience." 
Belloni then asked the panelists to give the audience at Neuehouse an answer for the following: Do you have a lesson you learned early in your career that guides you today?
"It's the simple one, and it's kind of stupid," said Quinn. "Nobody knows anything. We try to do everything [at Neon] as this highly functioning amoeba. Everyone in the room has equal voice and equal opportunity to fight for what they believe in."
Kounelias said hers was a two-parter. "Don't give up, and don't be afraid. ... Those are two things that have served me well."
Caines responded, "Trust the people around you. Surround yourself with smart people, and don't take credit."
For Barrick, the lesson learned was when there is a problem, don't rush to a Band-Aid-style solution. "Take a step back. Think about the problem differently as a whole."
Following the panel, Creative Fest continued with an afternoon and evening filled with programming including "Brands Go Hollywood: Learning the Secrets of Entertainment," "Trailer Geeks and Teaser Gods Podscast," "The Renaissance of the Soundtrack," "Keeping the Fans Fulfilled and Following: Fan First Digital Campaigns," "Case Study: Maisel Day" and "Trailer Fest." THR's digital editor Natalie Jarvey moderated the digital panel with panelists including Damian Bazadona from Situation, Matt Sample from hi5.agency, Ashley Tyra from Engine US, and Snapchat's Leah Rubin-Cadrain. 
On the film side, senior film editor Piya Sinha-Roy moderated a discussion with Sony's David Fruchbom, BLT Communications' Dawn Baillie, Sony's Elane Beyrodt, and Buddha Jones' Bill Neil about the marketing campaign for Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

Bong Joon Ho on Best Picture 'Parasite' Making Oscars History: 'It's Really F-ing Crazy'

Neon's "Parasite" made history on Sunday night at the 92nd Academy Awards, becoming the first foreign-language film ever to win a best picture Oscar.
Directed and co-written by Bong Joon Ho, the film follows an impoverished South Korean family posing as qualified professionals to gain long-term employment by a wealthy family.
Bong also won best director and best original screenplay, and "Parasite" won best international film, for a total of four Academy Awards.
Backstage with producer Kwak Sin Ae, co-screenwriter Han Jin Won, and translator Sharon Choi, Bong said in English, "It's really f-ing crazy!"
"I'm just a very strange person," Bong said. "I just did what I always did with producer Kwak. I feel like something will hit me and I will wake up from this dream."
As he did during his speech for the best director, Bong continued to sing the praises of his fellow nominee Martin Scorsese ("The Irishman"). "I've seen Scorsese lose this award multiple times. He didn't know me then, but I was so frustrated," Bong said. He was happy to see Scorsese win for "The Departed."
"To be nominated with him was so exciting," Bong said.
Accepting the award onstage, Kwak said: "I'm speechless. We never imagined this to ever happen, we are so happy. I feel like a very opportune moment in history is happening in history right now. I express my deepest gratitude and respect for all the members of the Academy for making this decision."
Following her remarks, producers cut the main stage lights and threw to presenter Jane Fonda, who was meant to bring the show to its end. But the audience revolted, with A-listers like Tom Hanks and Charlize Theron raising their arms and chanting, "Up! Up Up!" in reference to the lights.
They got their way.
When the lights came back up, executive producer Miky Lee said: "Bong, thank you. Thank you for being you. I like everything about him. His smile...the way he talks, the way he walks, and especially the way he directs," she said.
"I really, really, really want to thank our Korean film audience, our moviegoers," she continued, saying the feedback has ensured the team never became "complacent."
"Parasite" began receiving accolades in May 2019 when the film won the Palme d'Or at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival. Since then, the film has become a global box-office phenomenon, grossing $33.9 million domestically and $166.1 million worldwide. The film became the second foreign film to be nominated and the first to win at the Screen Actors Guild for outstanding performance by a cast. "Parasite" had also been nominated for top prizes at the Producers Guild, Directors Guild and BAFTAs.
It took the top Oscars prize over "1917," "Ford v Ferrari," "The Irishman," "Joker," "Jojo Rabbit," "Little Women," "Marriage Story" and "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."
Backstage, Bong was asked what message he had for Asian actors trying to work in the film industry. He noted that "The Farewell" - featuring an all-Asian cast, largely set in China and spoken in Mandarin - just won best feature at the Film Independent Spirit Awards on Saturday. Bong singled out the film's director Lulu Wang for praise, and noted that it shouldn't be necessary to separate Asian films from any other types.
"Me and Lulu Wang, we just make movies," he said. "It's all the same."

Parasite review - creepy invasion of the lifestyle snatchers; Bong Joon-ho's bizarre black comedy about a rich Korean family and a poor one in a modern-day Downton Abbey situation gets its tendrils in you

Star Rating: 4 stars
B ong Joon-ho has returned to Cannes with a luxuriously watchable and satirical suspense drama. It runs as purringly smooth as the Mercedes driven by the lead character, played by Korean star Song Kang-ho. Parasite is a bizarre black comedy about social status, aspiration, materialism and the patriarchal family unit, and people who accept the idea of having (or leasing) a servant class. Parasite is about a wealthy Korean family in a modern-day Downton Abbey upstairs-downstairs situation, one far more unstable than the patrician caste realises. The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean, and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch. But it is an enjoyable, elegant, scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema. The film, which is sumptuously designed, could be compared with, say,            Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden, an adaptation of the novel Fingersmith by Sarah Walters; and also            Im Sang-son's 2010 Cannes entry The Housemaid, a remake of Kim Ki-Young's classic Korean thriller from 1960. Also notable is the film's focus on poverty, desperation and the phenomenon of those in debt having to vanish to escape creditors (also a theme in            Lee Chang-dong's 2018 film Burning ). Song Kang-ho plays Ki-taek, a shiftless, unemployed man who lives in a chaotic, stinky and squalid basement with his wife, Chung-sook, his smart yet cynical twentysomething daughter, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), and son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik). They are all out of work and out of cash. 
Then Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune: an old school-friend helps him get a lucrative tutoring job. With a fake college diploma created by Ki-jung, he shows up at the fabulously lavish home of the Park family, wealthy entrepreneur Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun), his delicate, unworldly wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), their teen daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ziso) and her wacky kid brother, Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun). They have a loyal, live-in housekeeper named Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee). Likable Ki-woo is an instant hit with his new employers and his demure pupil Da-hye gets a real crush on him, which the coolly ruthless Ki-woo does nothing to discourage. Then the distrait lady of the house, Yeon-kyo, reveals that she also needs an art tutor for her young son, to mould his painting talents; Ki-woo suggests his sister (while concealing their relationship), and soon the brazen Ki-jung is also a success with these rich suckers. It looks as if the wealthy Parks could be a meal ticket for the whole crooked family, all pretending to be complete strangers to each other. But little-kid Da-song has noticed something that the grownups haven't: why do these people smell the same? The servant is someone with an intimate knowledge of his or her employer, and yet this intimacy is so easily - and inevitably - poisoned with resentment. There is a licensed transgression in servitude, and this transgression is nightmarishly amplified when it is a question of a entire family seeking to get up close and personal. The poorer family see themselves in a distorting mirror that cruelly reveals to them how wretched they are by contrast and reveals the riches that could - and should - be theirs. It is almost a supernatural or sci-fi story; an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers. Parasite gets its tendrils into you.

It also won director Bong Joon-Ho the Best Director award for a non-English film. Moreover, the film also won a third Oscar award for Best Original Screenplay. Apart from the Oscars, Parasite[2] has also won numerous awards.

Review: Parasite at the Cannes Film Festival; The movie veers between comedy, social commentary and darker fare with the woozy confidence of an intoxicated person trying a death-defying feat

****☆
It's another hit from the Bong! Bong Joon-Ho, the South Korean writer-director who brought us 
                   Okja                   
 and 
                   Snowpiercer                   
, has returned with another hilarious, strange and wildly imaginative concoction. It centres on a family of four: Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), his wife Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-Jin) and their twentysomething son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam)
They make a sorry quartet, crammed into a tiny basement flat, where they earn tiny sums from folding pizza boxes, watch drunks urinate against their window and scrounge free wifi from neighbouring cafés. Ki-jung crouches beside the toilet to get a signal and they open cans of beer to "toast their reconnection".
Yet their good-humoured squabbling conceals a streak of creative opportunism that surfaces when a friend of Ki-woo's offers him the chance to take over his job tutoring the daughter of a wealthy businessman. He and his family live in a vast modernist house that couldn't be more different from Ki-woo and co's dismal digs. It's an extraordinary space, all clean lines of glass and stone, that almost becomes a character in the film.
Ki-woo's sister forges him a university diploma and he wastes no time in inveigling his way into the affections of the girl and her mother (the excellent Cho Yeo-jeong), who is as trusting as she is generous with her husband's money. "She's rich, but she's still nice," says Ki-taek. "She's nice because she's rich," Chung-sook corrects.
Either way, the rest of Ki-woo's family are soon assuming aliases to get on the payroll of their oblivious benefactors, as chauffeur, housekeeper and art teacher to their disturbed young son. The deceptions become increasingly byzantine; the scenes in which they practise their lines are a hoot, as is Chung-sook's impression of North Korean news announcers.
What's already an entertaining yarn - like a heist movie crossed with a domestic farce - is then sent spinning off in a new direction by a totally unexpected twist. The film veers between comedy, social commentary and much darker fare with the woozy confidence of an intoxicated person attempting a death-defying feat. Whatever Bong puts in his bong must be darn strong. You expect the whole enterprise to come crashing down around his ears, but this is a film-maker in total control of his craft. 
                   Parasite                   
 must be a long shot to win the Palme d'Or.

Memories of Murder review - thrilling rerelease of Bong Joon-ho's breakthrough; The Parasite director's darkly comic 2003 thriller is not only a fine accomplishment in itself - it helped catch South Korea's most notorious serial killer

Body




Star Rating: 4 stars
B ong Joon-ho broke through to global acclaim with an Oscar for his film Parasite, and now the rerelease of his black comic thriller Memories of Murder from 2003 reminds you that, along with all his other glittering prizes and achievements, this director also helped catch the most notorious serial killer in South Korean history. His film is based on the Hwaseong serial murders of the late 1980s; they remained unsolved until this film came out, sparking a renewed upsurge of interest in the case, which led finally to the identification of the culprit last year - who was already serving a life sentence for the murder of his sister-in-law in 1994.
With the benefit of hindsight, we can see how the film challenges and subverts the serial killer procedural in its entirety; Anglo-Hollywood cops on the trail of psychopathic monsters tend to be tough professionals, or forensic savants - or they can be fascinatingly "flawed" with weaknesses or vulnerabilities that only underline how sympathetic they actually are. The officers in Memories of Murder are quite different. Veteran actor Song Kang-ho (the dad from Parasite) is the beefy, cynical Inspector Park; his dopey and aggressive sidekick is Inspector Cho (Kim Roe-ha) who beats suspects and uses a special woollen oven mitt-style overshoe to put on his boot when he wants to kick someone to avoid leaving a mark. A young cop transferred from Seoul, Inspector Seo (Kim Sang-kyung) has more professionalism but he, like the other two, is hopelessly out of his depth.
The crime scene itself - that holy of holies in serial killer movies - is chaotically compromised, with press and public barging all over the place, ruining the evidence, and the incompetent cops unable to stop them, and more than content to try beating confessions out of fantasists and inadequates. They are humiliatingly reliant on superior DNA labs in the US, and when Seo has some good ideas, his superiors can't give him the manpower he needs because all of the police are needed to suppress demonstrations. Memories of Murder is a great satire of official laxity and arrogance, and its final scene is very chilling.

Review: Class warfare depicted brilliantly in 'Parasite'

Bong Joon-ho's film "Parasite" starts in a dingy, half-basement apartment with a family of four barely able to scratch out a life. There must be no place to go but up, right? Yes and no. There's nothing predictable when the South Korean director is on his game.
This dark, socially conscious film about the intertwining of two families is an intricately plotted, adult thriller. We can go up, for sure, but Bong can also take us deeper down. There's always an extra floor somewhere in this masterpiece.
It tells the story of the impoverished four-person Kim family who, one by one, and with careful and devious planning, all get employed by the four-person affluent Park family - as a tutor, an art teacher, a driver and a housekeeper. They are imposters stunned by the way wealth can make things easier: "Money is an iron. It smooths out all the creases," says the Park patriarch with wonder.
Bong, who directed and wrote the story for "Parasite," has picked his title carefully, of course. Naturally, he's alluding to the sycophantic relationship by a clan of scammers to the clueless rich who have unwittingly opened the doors of their home on a hill. But it's not that simple. The rich family seem incapable of doing anything - from dishes to sex - without help. Who's scamming who?
Bong's previous films play with film genres and never hide their social commentary - think of the environmentalist pig-caper "Okja" and the dystopian sci-fi global warming scream "Snowpiercer." But this time, Bong's canvas is a thousand times smaller and his focus light-years more intense. There are no CGI train chases on mountains or car chases through cities. (There is also, thankfully, 100% less Tilda Swinton, a frequent, over-the-top Bong collaborator.)
The two Korean families first make contact when a friend of the Kim's son asks him to take over English lessons for the Park daughter. Soon the son (a dreamy Choi Woo-sik) convinces them to hire his sister (the excellent Park So-dam) as an art teacher, but doesn't reveal it's his sis. She forges her diploma and spews arty nonsense she learned on the internet, impressing the polite but firm Park matriarch (a superb Jo Yeo-jeong.)
The Park's regular chauffer is soon let go and replaced by the Kim patriarch (a steely Lee Sun-kyun). Ditto the housemaid, who is dumped in favor of the Kims' mother (a feisty Jang Hye-jin.) All eight people seem happy with the new arrangement until Bong reveals a twist: There are more parasites than you imagined. The clean, impeccably furnished Park home will have some blood splashing about.
Bong's trademark slapstick is still here but the rough edges of his often too-loud lessons are shaved down nicely and his actors step forward. "Keep it focused," the Kim's son counsels his father at one point. Bong has followed that advice.
There are typically dazzling Bong touches throughout. Just look for all the insect references - stink bugs at the beginning to flies at the end, and a preoccupation with odor across the frames. And there's a scene in which the rich matriarch skillfully winds noodles in a bowl while, in another room, duct tape is being wrapped around a victim and classical music plays.
Bong could have been more strident in his social critique but hasn't. There are no villains in "Parasite" - and also no heroes. Both families are forever broken after chafing against each other, a bleak message about the classes ever really co-existing (Take that, "Downton Abbey").
"Parasite" is a worthy winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, the first South Korean movie to win the prestigious top prize. The director has called it an "unstoppably fierce tragicomedy." We just call it brilliant.
"Parasite," a Neon release, is rated R for "language, some violence and sexual content." Running time: 136 minutes. Four stars out of four.

Cannes 2019 Winners: South Korean Movie ‘Parasite’ Wins the Palme d’Or

The Palme d’Or, the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival, was awarded Saturday to “Parasite,” a ferocious satire and critical favorite from the South Korean director Bong Joon-ho.
“I never imagined this,” Mr. Bong said, accepting the award. This is the first time that a South Korean movie has won the Palme d’Or. Sylvester Stallone, who was honored at the festival, presented the Grand Prix, or second prize, to the French-Senegalese filmmaker Mati Diop for her feature debut “Atlantics.” Ms. Diop is the first black woman to have a movie in the main competition.
The streamlined awards ceremony was quick and almost painless. The main competition jury was led by the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu, who said from the stage that while “democracy is disappearing” the jury was still very democratic. Its prizes included a “special mention” for “It Must Be Heaven,” an existential comedy from the Palestinian director Elia Suleiman.
The French director Céline Sciamma won the best screenplay prize for “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” Another critical favorite, this love story set in the 18th century centers on a female painter and her subject, a young woman whose portrait she is painting.
The best actress was presented to Emily Beecham, the star of “Little Joe,” a mordant, amusing movie from the Austrian director Jessica Hausner. The best actor was won by Antonio Banderas, the star of Pedro Almodóvar’s widely-loved “Pain and Glory.” “This is my night of glory,” Banderas said, as the audience burst into applause.
One of the biggest surprises was best director, which was given to the Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne for “Young Ahmed.” Press members in the theater opposite of the one in which the awards took place erupted in vigorous boos at the announcement. The Dardennes have won the Palme d’Or twice and their influence on contemporary cinema is profound, as was evident throughout the festival. But their new movie was seen by many critics as a disappointment.
The documentary filmmaker Michael Moore presented the Jury Prize (third prize), though only after taking a swipe at President Trump: “Trump is the lie that enables more lying,” he said. This award was shared by two radically different movies about marginalized communities under siege: the French genre movie “Les Misérables” from Ladj Ly, and the Brazilian movie “Bacurau,” from Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles. “We are ambassadors of culture in Brazil,” Mr. Mendonça said, and “we need support and respect.”
The most hotly anticipated film in the festival, Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,” left without any prizes. Saturday’s ceremony capped what was widely seen as one of the strongest festivals in years, and which found Mr. Tarantino, Mr. Almodóvar and Terrence Malick receiving some of their best reviews in a long time.

There is a short scene, in appearance casual, at the beginning of Parasite, which is significant when the most violent events, much later, begin to precipitate, one after the other, almost in chain. The Kim family, who live in a kind of subsoil whose minimal window overlooks the street at the height of the sidewalk, is made up of father, mother and their twentysomething children. None of the four have a formal job and survive by folding pizza boxes for a chain. When the pizzeria clerk comes to get their boxes, she wants to pay them a discount for the ones that doubled badly and they protest for that money they'll lose. Ki-woo, the youngest son, suggests firing the "unreliable" employee they have and hiring him. Since the girl doesn't assure her that that's going to be possible, Ki-woo convinces her not to get that discount.
The scene goes unnoticed in the midst of a series of events that are going to get bigger, funnier, intense and, finally, violent. But that's where the film's narrative twists and, moreover, its ideological complexity are evident. If it were not for the point of view, though technically omniscient, is with the Kims and puts us on their side through their misadventures, the family could quietly be the villain of the story being told. Faced with their obvious economic needs they have made a culture of research, of the trap (of the "plan", as they tell it) and that will be what they will use when entering, one by one, in the luxurious house of the Parks to work all there, from an opportunity that will be p Resent Ki-woo from being the English tutor to the eldest daughter of that wealthy family.
The young man, who was unable to pursue college school as his friends and has to forge his credentials, first brings in his older sister, Ki-jeong (who introduces himself with the studied expression "Jessica, only daughter, Illinois, Chicago"), who convinces the unborn so innocent "mom Park" that her youngest son needs an art therapy that she can provide. The girl then kicks out the Park driver and puts her father in fulfilling that function. And immediately afterwards, through an even more elaborate plan, Ki-jeong manages to sicken the maid of the house and replace her with her own mother. So the Kims have gone on to be all employed by the Parks without these millionaires, a little distracted in their own follies, to realize. Of course, homeowners have no idea that the Kims are a family: they assume they don't know each other. The only one who feels anything strange is the little boy, who notices that the four "smell alike".
This is just the beginning, the narrative starting point of Parasite, the movie-feeling of the season, another unclassifiable cross-genre jumping game from Bong Joon-ho, the Korean director of the magnificent Memories of Murder and The Host. This mix of comedy, thriller, police thriller, horror film and politically tinged family drama won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and has just earned six Oscar nominations, which is rare in non-English-spoken films. Rare is also the critical unanimity and fervor that aroused in its wake. Unlike 99 percent of such lyre films, it's virtually impossible to read or hear bad reviews about Bong's film. This isn't where they'll necessarily read that, but they will.I have the impression that the film – of almost perfect narrative construction and visually impeccable based on its limited spaces of action and movements – has some complicated or challenging ideas, depending on the view of each viewer, about each viewer's point of view, about of the world it portrays. And they're not that simple to unravel.
Most of Parasite's analyses put the focus – in addition to celebrating its impeccable plot of deception, the accumulation of narrative surprises in its second half and the growing tension that develops – in the kind of literal class struggle that would take place between the Park and the Kims, when the film actually conceals or hides other equally or more central battles: the Kims's with the other people of their own social stratum (yes, those they get kicked out of their respective jobs) or with those who are even worse off , characters that will then emerge from the depths when one least expects them. Since it is impossible to advance further on this line of thought without revealing details of the plot, I will leave it here, in suspense, understanding that the viewer, when watching the film, will know what I mean.
It is there that Parasite becomes a movie no longer in terms of "cat versus mouse" (or vice versa), in which the tricks and traps of a needy family become justifiable in terms of cheating on self-absorbed millionaires, but in a kind of "dog eats dog" (by "dog eats dog" (by "dog eats dog" (by continue with the metaphors of the animal world), a kind of worth everything among the desclasated of the system to be able to enter it, to belong, to be safe from the dangers, natural or socioeconomic, of the real world. It's a format we've seen in several films - only in Argentina are the cases of The Owners or Good Life Delivery, while, internationally, some Michael Haneke titles also have similar ideas and themes - only here they are framed in a proposal in appearance so genderthat any social commentary seems to be in the background.
Bong's clever trick, which makes the film much more complex than that simplistic initial look at the world seems to present, is to deflect attention to one side when the real story passes on the other and then spin it again on its axis. Not only that, but when one already thinks he has assimilated the logic of the film, the filmmaker puts those lines together in the most unexpected ways, revealing his magic pass and justifying, in a way perhaps somewhat cruel and cynical but certainly intelligent , their previous narrative decisions. It is a bloody and aggressive, aspirational world, in which the one who has nothing wants to have something, the one who has that something wants to have more at the expense of whoever and, finally, the one who has everything would prefer that everyone below continue to live in hiding , without "going over the line", in subsoils or shelters, where they are not smelled and, preferably, also not seen.
Parasite – the ingenious thing about the title is not knowing who the film is talking about – is a brilliant portrait of that social carnage, a kind of sinister experiment of those that so many psychologists tended to organize by putting some conflicting element in the midst of a heterogeneous group of people until some of its members were brought out, the worst of themselves in order to win that battle. In its ideologically confusing but narratively very effective way (to such apoint that takes a couple of visions to notice such ambiguities), Bong ends up reaffirming that there is no culprit among the characters of this funny but ultimately macabre story, that the guilt is fundamentally systemic and that for many it has the name of " wild capitalism." In fact, that expression would not look bad as a title for this film that will surely leave almost everyone ecstatic but, at the same time, looking suspiciously for all sides as they leave the cinema.

Cannes 2019: Palme d'Or Winner 'Parasite' Defined a Year of Movies About Class Warfare

Bong Joon-ho's Palme d'Or winner "Parasite" revolves around a family that overtakes a wealthy residence, bit by bit, but the best sequence finds them trapped. When an unexpected development (no spoilers here) puts their scheme at risk, they're forced to hide in various corridors of the expansive house, under floorboards and in the walls. It's a startling visual embodiment of the class warfare at the heart of the movie - and in much of Bong's work, from "Barking Dogs Never Bite" to "Snowpiercer" - wherein less fortunate people attempt to take control of the conditions holding them down, and wind up stuck somewhere in the middle.
Bong's directorial talents were long overdue for this prize: His slick ability to compose rich visuals in every frame, with complex characters almost too driven for their own good, has made him one of the greatest working filmmakers for years now. But "Parasite" was also an ideal choice for the top prize at this year's Cannes in a year when many of the best movies in Competition dealt with the same potent theme.
Consider "Atlantics." Mati Diop's surreal Grand Prix winner follows a group of women in Dakar abandoned by several young men who flee to the ocean in a quest to reach the coast of Spain. Ada (Mama Sané) is left to contend with a forced marriage to Omar (Barbara Sylla), a wealthy man whom her family hopes will support them. Ada feels trapped: On the one hand, she resents her lover abandoning her in a dreary, impoverished life; at the same time, she's expected to suppress her emotions for the sake of her family's stability.
As "Atlantics" heads in an eerie, supernatural direction, and the ghosts of men who departed for the sea come back to haunt Ada's small community, the movie creates the impression of a world defined by the haves and have-nots. Only through a profound, otherworldly set of circumstances can Ava even begin to contemplate the idea of an escape, but never once does it seem realistic.
So it goes in "Les Miserables" and "Bacurau," the movies that shared this year's Jury Prize. In Ladj Ly's "Les Miserables," thick-skulled police officers persecute a Muslim community in Paris for no reason other than their ongoing desire to confirm their superiority. Their mounting acts of aggression toward one rebellious Muslim youth lead to a dynamic showdown in an apartment complex when the entire neighborhood acts out in revolt.
That ending is mirrored rather closely in "Bacurau," Kleber Mendonca Filho and Juliano Dornelles' futuristic Brazilian Western, when a remote town bands together to fight back against mysterious vigilantes. Their purpose hovers in an ambiguous state for much of the story, but they take on a profound symbolic quality as the movie builds to its bloody finale, as a self-sustaining world defined by its self-sustaining ethos suddenly must fight to sustain its existence.
The stakes take on more personal ramifications in "Portrait of a Lady on Fire," Celine Sciamma's screenplay winner, which finds a wealthy young woman named Heloise (Adele Hanele) falling for lower-class painter Marianne (Noémie Merlant) in the 18th century. Their bond is powerful, intimate, and essentially impossible: While the movie doesn't waste time exploring the taboos associated with same-sex attraction at the time, remaining close to its main characters' developing bond, it magnifies just how much Heloise has been trapped by her palatial circumstances. As with Ada in "Atlantics," Heloise is expected to marry a man who can support her and keep her comfortable, but that assumption doesn't take into account what she actually wants for herself. Her love affair is a quiet act of rebellion against the system holding her in place.
While the fixation of these Cannes entries suggests a mounting discontent with wealth and persecution around the world, Ken Loach got there first. The British auteur has been the ultimate chronicler of underclass frustrations for over half a century, and his Competition entry "Sorry We Missed You" is a vintage example. Tackling the gig economy head-on, Loach focuses on desperate family man Ricky (Kris Hitchen) as he takes on a contract gig driving a delivery van around London, signing away his rights in the process. Loach excels at showing how vast industrial systems exploit the working man, and Ricky's innocuous descent into a machine keen on eating him alive is tragic to watch, mostly because it feels so real.
Nevertheless, the narrative of this year's Cannes goes back to the beginning. Jim Jarmusch's "The Dead Don't Die" opened the festival to lukewarm reviews, but the master of deadpan's dark zombie comedy is nothing if not a pointed critique of an exploitative system. The undead in Jarmusch's kooky ensemble are drawn to products that they obsessed over in their lives - wifi, Xanax, coffee, you name it - and it doesn't take much to see just how much contempt Jarmusch has for the way we've all become materialistic slaves.
It's a blunt metaphor, explained in bitter terms in Tom Waits' apocalyptic voiceover, but in retrospect it set the stage for the festival's many depictions of global outrage against capitalist persecution. Wealth attracts and it takes away; in the process, it catalyzes dramatic narratives that must be told. Even bad movies can be portals to the fears, anxieties, and frustrations of the times in which they're made; the 2019 Cannes Film Festival brought us some great ones.

IN 'PARASITE,' THE CLASS STRUGGLE IS REAL, AND WILDLY ENTERTAINING; MOVIE REVIEW

Arich man walks up the stairs of his extravagant home. With each step, a lamp goes on above his head, lighting his path. He doesn't think twice about why the lights are timed to his steps. He's so used to always being in the light he hardly notices.
What's going on with those lights is one small mystery among many in Bong Joon Ho's brilliant social thriller "Parasite." It's the third film (after "Snowpiercer" and "Okja") in which Bong turns the inequities of late capitalism into unnerving, darkly funny and constantly surprising high-end entertainment.
While "Snowpiercer" turned the class system into a series of train cars hurtling on an express ride to nowhere, "Parasite" turns the metaphor on its end. At the literal bottom of an unnamed South Korean city is the Kim family, crowded together in a semi-basement apartment that gives them a ringside seat to watch drunks peeing in the street.
The family scrapes by on menial jobs like folding pizza boxes, but teenage son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) dreams of something better. A friend gives him a heavy stone that's supposed to bring good luck, a metaphor for the elusive dream of upward mobility. If it's so lucky, then why does it weigh him down so much?
But luck does come. A friend is off to college, and offers Ki-woo the chance to take his place tutoring the teenage daughter of a rich family who lives up the hill. As Ki-woo heads up to their mansion, the difference between his circumstances and theirs is literally night and day ? the first time we see sunlight in the film is the moment when he enters their perfectly manicured backyard.
The house (actually a set built for the film) is an architectural marvel, a series of interlocking boxes with giant picture windows everywhere. But the windows only offer views of the grounds ? giant hedges block the messiness of the outside world. The family pays a lot of money to forget that the rest of the world doesn't live as they do.
Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) glide through life, pleasant but distant, so used to things going their way that they can't imagine any other way of living. Ki-woo is entranced by their world, and soon convinces his sister Ki-jung (Park Sodam) to forge some credentials and get a job as an art therapist for the Parks' young son. Then comes mom and dad, hired on as the Parks' maid and personal driver. This means finding some diabolically sneaky ways of getting the current staff fired, and as clever and funny as the schemes are, the laughs stick in our throat a little. We're watching a family do whatever's necessary to go from the bottom rung of the ladder to the second-from-the-bottom rung. Meanwhile, the rich family is oblivious ? what's one maid compared with another?
I won't reveal any more, except that the family's scheme to keep living the good life ? or at least, to serve those who live the good life ? is tested in ways they never imagined. Bong is brilliant at dispensing some wild plot twists, and shifting between several tones for the film. Some scenes have the daffy precision of a bedroom farce, others the claustrophobic tension of a home invasion thriller.
Bong handles these shifts confidently, and beneath the film's visual wit and narrative elegance burns an undeniable anger at a world divided into Parks and Kims. Which family is the real parasite, feeding off the other, is a provocative question that lingers long after the movie's ended and our heart rates have returned to normal.

Aug 15, 2019( Den of Geek: http://www.denofgeek.com Delivered by Newstex)  Harriet Chappell[1] Aug 15, 2019 Classes clash in the first trailer for this social thriller from The Host director Bong Joon-ho  The first official trailer has arrived for Bong Joon-ho's South Korean black-comedy thriller, Parasite. Having already won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, it has officially become the first Korean film to ever take this award, and it could mean it's in line to become Korea's first-ever Oscar nominee and, dare we say it, even possible winner. See related Upcoming horror movies heading your way in 2019, 2020 and beyond[2] 81 genuinely creepy horror movies [3] The 25 best horror movies on Netflix - creepy films to watch right now[4] Oscars rarely acknowledge genre films and it's slightly surprising South Korea hasn't yet been featured in the Best Foreign Film category up until now - last year,The Burning made it to the nine-film shortlist but didn't hit the final cut. 
From the trailer, this looks like a satirical thriller packed with major plot swerves and a vein of dark humour. Watch with a clear mind - there's a load to take in. Without spoiling the plot, Parasite sees the wealthy Parks and the hard-up Kims clash when the Kim kids manage to get themselves employed by the Parks under false pretences.Like much of Bong's work it's a social commentary, but while the trailer has horror trappings the 'Parasite' of the title is strictly metaphorical. Though violence clearly ensues... You can watch the trailer forParasite trailer below Play Video[5] This is Bong's seventh feature after his award-winning monster movie The Host as well as weird, Netflix-funded giant-pig film, Okja[6]. It's possible that genre movies are starting to be more widely acknowledged by the Academy. Jordan Peele's social horror Get Out[7] was nominated for four awards in 2017. It could be an indicator that Parasite might follow. Parasite opens in the US on 11 October 2019; there's no UK release date yet confirmed. https://dennis.slgnt.eu/optiext/optiextension.dll?ID=MofMeN7jyuGShLcNaQZjt2R0PrNwdl85y9epNKwQKD67qFo2wdgsw249hZyuiJDnRzk5WqgEIoBCgWhEqf...NDS_NEWSLETTERIDS=WEK_DLY%2CWEK_PPL%2CWEK_SPT...SLETTER_ID=DOG_STD...SCRIBE_SOURCE=web0002dog...ND_CODE=DOG [ 1]:            https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/authors/harriet-chappell [ 2]:            https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/horror/63465/upcoming-horror-movies-heading-your-way-in-2019-2020-and-beyond [ 3]:            https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/21744/creepy-horror-movies [ 4]:            https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/best-horror-movies-netflix [ 5]:            https://www.youtube.com/embed/isOGD_7hNIY [ 6]:            https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/okja/50397/okja-review [ 7]:            https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/get-out/47919/get-out-review

‘Parasite’ tops The Salt Lake Tribune’s top 10 movies of 2019

We kept hearing how divided the nation is, but at the movies in 2019, the walls have been falling down.
The once-unbreachable wall between theatrical films and streaming titles, already weakened last year with the awards success of “Roma,” took more hits from the likes of Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”) and Noah Baumbach (“Marriage Story”). “Roma” also put some holes in the notion that movies not in English couldn’t succeed stateside — something Cannes winners “Parasite” and “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” seemed to disprove as American audiences and critics embraced them.
Everyone, save a few purists, agreed that they liked movies about Marvel superheroes (“Avengers Endgame,” “Captain Marvel”) and DC villains (“Joker”). Everyone waited with anticipation for the final chapter of the Skywalker saga that began 42 years earlier with “Star Wars” — even if the movie itself was a disappointment. And everyone could agree “Cats” was just plain weird.
There were some great movies in 2019, stories that took us to Korea and China, to 18th century France and mid-20th century Detroit, to a rock star’s decline and a mission to the moon. Here are my choices for the top 10 movies of 2019
1. “Parasite” • A family of poor con artists insinuate themselves in the lives of a rich Seoul family, taking servants’ jobs through means fair and foul — only to find out there’s a deeper secret within the walls of the opulent house. Director Bong Joon-Ho’s modern-day thriller is a bloody mystery, a precisely observed family drama, and a sly but sharp commentary on the haves and the have-nots. (Now in theaters.)
2. “The Irishman” • The late-career work we’ve been waiting for Martin Scorsese to make recounts the memories of fixer and hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro). His tales of working through the Philly mob and becoming a confidante of Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) are fascinating, even if they might be historically suspect. With a cast led by De Niro, Pacino and an out-of-retirement Joe Pesci, Scorsese builds on his gangster-movie reputation to create a searing drama and a meditation on the grave that awaits us all. (Streaming on Netflix.)
3. “Her Smell” • Meet Becky Something, a punk-rock queen who’s spiraling out of control — and writer-director Alex Ross Perry takes us along for the ride, as Becky (brilliantly played by Elisabeth Moss) alienates her bandmates, tries to wield control over an up-and-coming band, and burns almost all her bridges toward recovery. With Moss and a strong supporting cast, led by Agyness Deyn as Becky’s much-abused bass player and collaborator, Perry creates a kinetic masterpiece of a rocker’s fall and unsteady revival. (Available on demand or Blu-ray.)

4. “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” • In 18th century France, Marianne (Noémie Merlant), an independent painter, is hired to create a portrait of Héloise (Adèle Haenel), recently plucked from the convent by her countess mother (Valeria Golina) to marry an Italian nobleman. Marianne’s challenge is that Héloise doesn’t want to sit for a portrait, so the artist must befriend her subject and observe her looks — and paint from memory on the sly. Writer-director Céline Sciamma herself paints a luminous picture of passions, sexual and otherwise, and the liberation of female connection. (Opens at the Broadway Centre Cinemas on Feb. 28.)
5. “Avengers Endgame” and “Captain Marvel” • In a year when some franchises — like “Game of Thrones” and “Star Wars” — ended with some disappointment, the Marvel Cinematic Universe stuck the landing with the satisfying “Avengers Endgame.” Our heroes sacrifice much, sometimes all, to restore the universe altered by Thanos, in a story that balances humor, heartbreak and action perfectly. The franchise also produced “Captain Marvel,” a rousing Marvel character introduction, with Brie Larson as the headstrong heroine caught between her human past and her Kree present, and Samuel L. Jackson showing us how Nick Fury became the Avengers’ chief recruiter. (Streaming on Disney+ and available on Blu-ray.)
6. “Apollo 11” • Want to go to the moon? Director Todd Douglas Miller does the next best thing in this engrossing documentary, reconstructing the first mission to the moon through a wealth of archival footage — much of it never seen since the launch in 1969 — and a sound design that makes the viewer feel the rockets are under their seats. (Available on demand or on Blu-ray.)
7. “Ms. Purple” • Kasie (Tiffany Chu, in a stunning debut) works as a karaoke hostess in a Koreatown bar, trying to make enough money to help her dying father. Desperate when her dad’s caretaker quits, Katie calls on her estranged brother, Carey (Teddy Lee), to help out — and, in so doing, reopens old wounds from their abusive childhood. Director Justin Chon’s detailed, intense drama burrows under the viewer’s skin and doesn’t let go. (Available on demand.)
8. “One Child Nation” • Nanfu Wang had something growing up in China that few girls her age did a sibling. Wang, now living in America, returns to China to talk to officials and family members about that country’s brutal one-child policy, in place from 1970 to 2015, and how it forever altered generations of Chinese people. (Streaming on Amazon Prime.)
9. “Booksmart” • This raucous and winning teen comedy is refreshingly of the moment, as it tracks two straight-A students (Kaitlyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein) on the last day of school, when they realize they’ve missed out on partying and try to make it all up in one night. The results, in the hands of first-time director Olivia Wilde, is both riotously funny and a perfect distillation of freshly minted high-schoolers both eager for and terrified of the next step. (Available on demand or on Blu-ray.)
10. “The Farewell” • Director-writer Lulu Wang tells the true story of a Chinese-American writer (Awkwafina) who’s told her favorite grandma (Shuzhen Zhao) has terminal cancer. What’s more, the family has opted not to tell her, but are all going to China to visit her one last time, using the pretense of a wedding. Wang’s wry semi-autobiographical comedy is a gentle reminder of the lengths we all go to keep our family happy and, sometimes, in the dark. (Available on demand.)

'Parasite' Star Song Kang Ho on His Early Days: 'I Was Reluctant to Act in Movies'

"Parasite" is a global hit and an Oscar contender, which means many audiences will be seeing actor Song Kang Ho for the first time. But in fact, he's had a terrific career in Korean films for more than 20 years.
Song was first mentioned in Variety on Nov. 23, 1998, in a review of the film "The Quiet Family." Asked if he remembers the review, he says, "Of course I was aware of Variety at the time, because Variety is a famous magazine. I don't remember the review, but it's positive, so thank you!
"In the beginning, I read every single review. I was affected by each one, whether praise or criticism. As time has passed, I don't think reviews are so important."
Neon's "Parasite" marks the actor's fourth film with writer-director Bong Joon Ho. "When making it, I had the feeling it was special. The structure is unique, and I understood the message he wanted to deliver."
When did you know you wanted to be an actor?In my early 20s. I wanted to become a good actor, but I didn't have a role model. Nobody else in the family was in entertainment. They didn't approve of my choice. They didn't like it. It's not just my family: In general, if a family is told you want to be a theater actor, they say, "No, are you crazy?" I thought of acting as a career from the beginning. I envisioned remaining a theater actor. I went to school, to an acting program, but only for a short while. My real training was with a theater company that I was a member of for years. The name of the company translates as "Theater Friends Stage." My pay was very low, of course. I think culturally, theater is not where you make money as an actor.
Did you audition much?The last time I auditioned was 20 years ago. I never auditioned for stage, because I was a member of that theater company. For film, it was more of a meeting with the director than an audition. Auditions are pretty common these days for young actors. I consider myself lucky. If I had to audition, I probably would not get any roles.
When you started out, did you want to do film work?At the beginning, I was reluctant to act in movies. At that time, 20-30 years ago - no, say 20: I'm not that old! - the status of the Korean film industry was not as high as it is now. And the film industry was not so welcoming to actors from the theater. I had watched other actors struggle or fail in making that transition. But I was lucky enough to have a fairly easy transition. With films, it was hard to have all the waiting. What's funny is that now, I wish I could have a little more down time. Directors these days are working very fast, so waiting time is less and less. I think directors and crews are much better prepared than before.
Did you get any good advice?I don't remember a specific person, but one of my senior actors onstage said: "Do not become a technical actor. Do not act in a typical, predictable way." That was advice I still try to follow.
Any plans to return to theater?The last time I was onstage was 20 years ago. You can blame this on my inability to multitask. And the longer I stay away, the more fearful I become.
Did you like "The Quiet Family"?It's one of my favorites. It's a unique film, and it was fun to make. It's about a family, and it's an ensemble film, but it's very different from "Parasite."

"Parasite's" Success is a Triumph for Expanding Global Cinema

Editor's note: This article contains spoilers for Parasite.
It's no secret that Parasite, the latest film from South Korean director Bong Joon-Ho, has swept the globe. With its shocking twists, its meditated commentary on wealth inequality, and its historic accolades, Parasite is not only a critical and commercial success, but also a personal win for its Asian and Asian-American fans at Oberlin.
This past Saturday, College fourth-years and East Asian Studies student representatives Will Cramer and Liam Hefta organized a free dinner and discussion followed by a group screening at the Apollo Theatre, with support from the East Asian Studies Department, Oberlin Korean Student Association, and Asian American Alliance. While Cramer personally enjoyed the film, he also saw it as an opportunity to promote East Asian cinema and the East Asian Studies department to interested students.
"I thought it would be good to showcase East Asian cinema, and there are [professors like] Keren He who teach on East Asian cinema," Cramer said. "And then Parasite on its own is such an amazing movie, so it was a way to draw people in, get them interested."
Cramer and Hefta approached Associate Professor of History and East Asian Studies Emer O'Dwyer with the idea, who said she was "all for it." 
Parasite presents its audience with two families: the Kims and the Parks. The Parks live in a private lot with a wide green lawn, a personal housekeeper, and the best private tutors for their children. In contrast, the Kims lead a more modest life; we first meet the Kim siblings Ki-woo and Ki-jung as they scuttle about their semi-basement apartment trying to pick up on a free Wi-Fi signal while their father, Ki-taek, lets pesticide spray inside as "free extermination." There is no reason for these families to ever cross paths - but when Ki-woo's friend Min asks him to take over as Da-hye Park's English tutor by faking his credentials, it is an economic prospect that Ki-woo cannot resist. 
Thus begins an erratic, nearly unbelievable string of events all motivated by lies, deception, and greed. Parasite teeters wildly between genres, but it retains a dark satirical commentary on the pitfalls of capitalism throughout.
While Parasite is a contemporary film about South Korean society, it includes wider global issues and influences that intertwine seamlessly: wealth inequality, classism, and climate change. Midway through the film, a torrential rainstorm hits Seoul, flooding the Kims' apartment and forcing them to take shelter with hundreds of other displaced families in a gymnasium. As the scene cuts to the next morning, we open on the Park family home, where the family's matriarch, Yeon-kyo, marvels at how nice the sunshine is for her spoiled son's birthday party. While not intentionally malicious toward the lower class, the Parks embody the utter obliviousness that is characteristic of privileged upper-class society. 
"No place is immune from this environmental devastation," O'Dwyer commented on the rainstorm. "However, as Director Bong suggests, the wealthy have many more resources and choices when confronted by it." 
For Oberlin's Asian students and faculty, Parasite's widespread viewership and critical acclaim is a personal victory. Visiting Instructor of History Jiyul Kim, who is Korean-American, recalled how he was "amused and appreciative" of non-Korean viewers who were so willing to watch a movie that was "so quintessentially Korean" in its imagery, themes, and script. 
"My first impression after the movie was to ask myself how someone not familiar with South Korean society and culture could really understand the nuances of the images and language [in the film]," Kim wrote in an email to the Review. "But my 13-year-old son's reaction made me realize how wrong I was. This young man, who [is] only half-Korean by blood and all-American teenager in culture, emphatically said, 'That was the best movie I have ever seen.'" 
Kim further explained various details that were distinctive of South Korean culture in the film.
"For example, [the film alludes to] the politics of private tutoring, which has been made illegal because it gave the rich unfair advantage in the hyper-competitive South Korean education system." 
The way Parasite explores universal themes with a distinctly South Korean presentation is what makes it truly groundbreaking. From winning the Palme D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival to sweeping the four major categories at the Oscars - becoming the first foreign film to win Best Picture - Parasite, along with Roma in 2018, could be reflective of a changing American entertainment landscape opening its doors to non-Western cinema.
"Clearly I agree with the vast majority of non-Korean viewers that Parasite's universal appeal has to do with its socioeconomic subject and message, which comes across regardless of any opaque cultural filters," Kim wrote. "And it's also because that universal message was presented through an entertaining and memorable story, an intoxicating cocktail of drama, comedy, and horror that lingers long after."
Parasite's masterful storytelling and its numerous awards legitimize foreign films as not only worth watching, but capable of winning awards alongside Hollywood blockbusters, and whose non-white, non-English-speaking casts proudly grace the stage.
College second-year and Chinese-American student Michelle Tyson attested to the value of international representation and the use of films to focus on marginalized groups such as the Kim family. 
"I'm so proud of a film that features really amazing South Korean actors and a story that so blatantly deals with class," Tyson wrote in an email to the Review. "The public reception to films like Moonlight and Roma, which, like Parasite, made me so grateful to see marginalized identities and class so clearly portrayed on the big screen."
College second-year Rachel Fang, while having a slightly different perspective as a Chinese international student, discussed that after growing up watching numerous high-quality, Asian-made movies, she hopes that Parasite introduces white American audiences to everything that global cinema has to offer.
"As an international student seeing lots and lots of Asian movies ... Parasite is just one of the good movies that I've seen," Fang said. "I hope more people can get the chance to watch more good Asian movies because there are a lot of Asian movies that are as good as Parasite that [have] not [been] nominated [at] the Oscars."
While Parasite is only one film, and may not guarantee greater diversity in future awards shows, it has still disrupted what has long been a stagnant lineup.
"Will [Parasite] have staying power?" Kim pondered. "The true impact won't be known for decades. Still, at the very least, I think Parasite's win has opened many people's eyes to Korean cinema, which has become very vibrant and relevant, so I hope it will lead to wider viewership and appreciation for Korean films."

Oscar predictions 2020: who will win, from Joker to Parasite

 January 14 -- The 92nd Academy Awards take place on February 9, 2020, and it's undoubtedly the hottest ticket in the Hollywood calendar. Every big movie star will be there, all to celebrate the very best the movie industry work from the past year. Who, though, is likely to win in 2020? The 2020 Oscar nominations are now out there, so we know which movies and starts are in contention. 
Below, we've taken our best guess at who'll win big on Oscar night. We've based our predictions on the shortlists and winners for other big Hollywood awards (the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards and the BAFTAs) and tapped into pre-Academy Award buzz to work out who we think will have the best chance on Oscar night.
Will The Irishman make a killing for Netflix? Will Once Upon a Time in Hollywood give Quentin Tarantino his first Best Picture win? Or will Joker become the first comic book movie to take the big prize? That last one might be a little optimistic, but you never know. 
We take a look at the contenders to work out the likely nominations for this year's Oscars - and predict who might be delivering a victory speech on the night... 
When are the 2020 Oscars?The awards themselves take place on Sunday, February 9. 
Best Picture 2020 Oscar predictions
•	Ford V Ferrari
•	The Irishman
•	Jojo Rabbit
•	Joker
•	Little Women
•	Marriage Story
•	1917
•	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
•	Parasite
If you were hoping Avengers: Endgame might squeeze out a nomination this year, it's hard luck. This is pretty much what we predicted the shortlist would be, although Ford V Ferrari surprised us by making it in, and it's a shame Bombshell didn't get a nod in the best picture category. Otherwise, it's wall-to-wall prestige movies with the exception of Joker, which feels more likely to win in an acting category rather than Best Picture. 
Who do we think will win? Given the talent involved and the technical achievement of successfully de-ageing Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, it's hard to look past The Irishman. But 1917, winning the Golden Globe for the equivalent category and getting a sweep of Bafta nominations, may have an edge in awards season.
Who do we want to win? It would be exciting to see Parasite take this award instead of the more predictable contenders. 
Best Director Oscar predictions 
 
•	Martin Scorsese (The Irishman)
•	Todd Phillips (Joker)
•	Sam Mendes (1917)
•	Quentin Tarantino (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)
•	Bong Joon-ho (Parasite)
The Academy snubbed Greta Gerwig this year, which is a real shame, leaving an all-male category of contenders. The competition will be stiff, nonetheless: Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes (whose all-in-one-shot war movie 1917 brings plenty of wow factor) are both vying for their second Best Director prize, while Quentin Tarantino will be hungry for his first after his best-received movie in years. And don't bet against Korean director Bong Joon-ho's work on Parasite. 
Who do we think will win? A much-loved movie directed by an icon of cinema means Scorsese is the person to beat - assuming there's no anti-Netflix backlash, as there has been in previous years. Tarantino, however, won the Golden Globe, which suggests he's more likely to win in this category than Best Picture. 
Who do we want to win? With Gerwig out of the running, it'd again be nice to see Bong Joon-ho win outside of the International Feature Film category. 
Best Actor Oscar predictions 
 
•	Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory)
•	Leonardo DiCaprio (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)
•	Adam Driver (Marriage Story)
•	Joaquin Phoneix (Joker)
•	Jonathan Pryce (The Two Popes)
Where else would you find the Pope in competition with The Joker? Jonathan Pryce has attracted plenty of buzz for his convincing outing as Pope Francis (a role he was arguably destined to play), while Pedro Almodóvar traditionally coaxes a great performance out of Antonio Banderas. After Joker pushed the boundaries of what a comic-book movie can do, however, it would be a brave person who bets against Joaquin Phoenix following up his 2005 victory for Walk the Line.
Who do we think will win? It's a toss-up between Adam Driver - equally charismatic, whether he's ruling the galaxy or dealing with divorce in Marriage Story - or Joaquin Phoenix's chillingly unhinged performance in Joker. Phoenix won the Golden Globe, though, which makes him feel like the more likely winner.  
Who do we want to win? Adam Driver's sensitive performance in Marriage Story shows what a superstar he really is. No wonder directors are trying to cast him in everything. 
Best Actress Oscar predictions 
 
 
•	Cynthia Erivo (Harriet)
•	Scarlett Johansson (Marriage Story)
•	Saorise Ronan (Little Women)
•	Charlize Theron (Bombshell)
•	Renée Zellweger (Judy)
The shortlist here could've been five entries longer this year than it is. The nominations are a mix of up-and-comers (Cynthia Erivo), genuine A-listers (Scarlett Johansson) and regular Oscar contenders (Saoirse Ronan, Renée Zellweger, Charlize Theron). Let battle commence!
 
 
Who do we think will win? Renée Zellweger's performance as Judy Garland feels like the Hollywood choice (indeed, she won the Golden Globe) but after Johansson's emotionally powerful performance in Marriage Story, who knows?
Who do we want to win? This would be a fourth Oscar nomination for Saoirse Ronan by the age of 25 - she probably won't win this year, but surely her time must come soon, as it did for Kate Winslet.  
Best Supporting Actor Oscar predictions 
 
•	Tom Hanks (A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood)
•	Anthony Hopkins (The Two Popes)
•	Al Pacino (The Irishman)
•	Joe Pesci (The Irishman)
•	Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood)
This category is traditionally a Lifetime Achievement Award by stealth, and never has that been more true than this year, when the shortlist is entirely composed of bona fide Hollywood legends. In fact, the only one of our quintet yet to get their hands on a golden statue is Brad Pitt - and that may just work in his favor...
Who do we think will win? With The Irishman vote likely to be split between Al Pacino and Joe Pesci, and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood and The Two Popes both likely to be Oscar night outsiders, the stars are aligning for Brad Pitt (who arguably gave his best performance in the last year in Ad Astra, rather than Once Upon a Time). 
Who do we want to win? Brad Pitt's laconic stuntman was one of the best things about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and few could begrudge him an Academy Award as reward for an impressive career. 
 
Best Supporting Actress Oscar predictions 
 
•	Kathy Bates (Richard Jewell)
•	Laura Dern (Marriage Story)
•	Scarlett Johansson (Jojo Rabbit)
•	Florence Pugh (Little Women)
•	Margot Robbie (Bombshell)
Unlike its male counterpart, our nominations only feature one previous Oscar winner (Kathy Bates). With a Best Actress nomination already secure, Scarlett Johansson's unlikely to win here against her Marriage Story co-star Laura Dern - though up-and-comer Florence Pugh could be an outside bet. 
Who do we think will win? Laura Dern got the Golden Globe in this category, deservedly so for her role as a ruthless lawyer in Marriage Story, so it feels like she's got this. 
Who do we want to win? It's hard to believe that it's only seven years since Margot Robbie burst onto the scene in Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. After a string of memorable performances since, her turn as a Fox News producer in Bombshell could launch her into the elite.  
Best Original Screenplay Oscar predictions 
 
•	Knives Out
•	Marriage Story
•	1917
•	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
•	Parasite
This category may be the best chance of a win for Best Picture contenders Marriage Story and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, but they won't get it all their own way.  Rian Johnson's Knives Out is a wonderfully sharp whodunnit, and you can't rule out a clean sweep for 1917.
Who do we think will win? Seeing as Hollywood traditionally loves movies about itself, expect Quentin Tarantino to pick up his third writing Oscar for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - especially if he doesn't win for Best Picture.
Who do we want to win? The compelling and frequently hilarious mystery of Knives Out deserves this, to make up for being snubbed in the other major categories. 
Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar predictions 
 
•	The Irishman
•	Jojo Rabbit
•	Joker
•	Little Women
•	The Two Popes
Another category that has a strong Netflix contingent, with The Two Popes (adapted by Anthony McCarten from his own play) up against The Irishman, Steven Zaillian's take on I Heard You Paint Houses by Charles Brandt. Little Women gives it strong competition, although we'd be very surprised if Joker is the winner here compared to other categories. 
Who do we think will win? If The Irishman doesn't win in other categories, expect it to pick up an award here.
Who do we want to win? Given that Greta Gerwig didn't get the Best Director nod for Little Women, this would be a well deserved consolation. 
Best Animated Feature  
 
•	How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World
•	I Lost My Body
•	Klaus
•	Missing Link
•	Toy Story 4
Disney is likely to take this prize home, though it's a surprise that Frozen 2 didn't get a nomination. Netflix enters the fray with with Christmas-themed Klaus and the leftfield I Lost My Body, while Laika (the company behind Paranorman and the sublime Kubo and the Two Strings) won the Golden Globe with Missing Link. Finally, the latest How to Train Your Dragon completes the nominations.  
Who do we think will win? In a clash of the Disney titans, Toy Story 4 seems to have the edge over Frozen II, and maintain Pixar's record of winning the prize, on average, every other year. That said, Laika won with Missing Link at the Golden Globes, so it has a shot. 
Who do we want to win? While it would be nice to show some love to an unconventional newbie like I Lost My Body, Toy Story 4 was such a perfect end to a wonderful saga that the heart belongs to Woody and Buzz. 
Best Score Oscar predictions 
 
•	Hildur Guðnadóttir (Joker)
•	Alexandre Desplat (Little Women)
•	Randy Newman (Marriage Story)
•	Thomas Newman (1917)
•	John Williams (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker)
Traditionally one of the hardest categories to call - yes, every category in the Oscars is subjective, but the success of a score is so down to personal taste that it's incredibly difficult to second guess what Oscar voters will go for. There's an absurd level of composer royalty going on in this category.
Who do we think will win? He's just completed the score for the ninth movie in a saga he began in 1977 with the original Star Wars - don't be surprised if this turns into a lifetime achievement award (and fifth Oscar win) for the 87-year-old John Williams for The Rise of Skywalker. 
Who do we want to win? Hildur Guðnadóttir is the only newcomer on the list, but her foreboding, string-heavy Joker score added to the uneasy, grimy atmosphere of an unsettling movie. Plus she won the Golden Globe. 
Best International Feature Film Oscar predictions
•	Corpus Christi
•	Honeyland
•	Les Misérables
•	Pain and Glory
•	Parasite
The fact that there's no requirement for Academy voters to have watched every foreign language movie in contention arguably has a larger effect on this category than any other - most of the releases won't have received a wide release in the United States, so won't be in the general consciousness. That means that - even with a pre-released 10-movie shortlist to work from - the more famous, most-talked about movies are at a big advantage. That's surely going to work in favour of Parasite, which is also nominated for Best Picture among other categories. 
Who do we think will win? It's already won the Palme D'Or at Cannes, has received brilliant reviews and is on the shortlist for Best Picture - it's impossible to look past Parasite. 
Who do we want to win? Parasite would be a worthy winner, but seeing as the consistently brilliant Pedro Almodóvar won his only Oscar 20 years ago (for All About My Mother), it feels like a second - for Pain & Glory - is long overdue.

Oscars TV Review: Eminem Can't Save Another Hostless Night For Hollywood, Despite 'Parasite's Historic Best Picture Win
Deadline
February 10, 2020

 Copyright 2020 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved
 
Length: 1058 words

With most of the top categories long locked in, if there was any real drama in the 92nd Oscars on Sunday it was how well another year of no host would fare.
Not so great turned out to be the answer for Hollywood and ABC after the more than three-hour-long ceremony.
After the novelty of last year's forced lack of a host after the Kevin Hart fiasco, this year seemed to hope going hostless again would hide the cracks in a show produced by Lynette Howell Taylor and Stephanie Allain that had nothing much new to say on Tinseltown's biggest night. Hope sometime can't close the deal, sorry to say.
Yes, with 1917 left out of the party, it was certainly a big and historic night for Parasite and director Bong Joon Ho. Major acting category wins went to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood's            Brad Pitt, Marriage Story's            Laura Dern, Joker's earnest            Joaquin Phoenix and Judy's Renée Zellweger. Certainly, no one who loves movies could stay dry-eyed at the lovely standing ovation for "our great            Martin Scorsese," prompted by Bong            in his Best Director acceptance speech at the Dolby Theater.
However, with relatively little to shock in the big categories, if your big surprise of the night is bringing an album-peddling Eminem back to belt out his 75th Academy Awards-winning Best Original Song "Lose Yourself" and it was the night's first standing ovation at past the 90-minute mark, you have a problem - and I love Mr. Marshall Mathers and that 8 Mile tune.
Peddling the same choir book as last year's Oscars produced by Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss, with as much music to almost rival a half-hearted Grammys, and throwback montages to the songs of past cinema, the 2020 Oscars bellowed out for a ringmaster to harness what soon became a lackluster circus. Bested early on by multiple Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais in           his online mocking Sunday, the low point on a night of many dips had to be Randy Newman back on that Toy Story beat with a tune that appears to have taken just over twice as long to write as it took to perform.
Oscars: Wins By Film & Studio
Starting off with a high-octane glamapalooza of Harriet star Janelle Monáe with Billy Porter and Best Picture-garbed dancers blasting out the Mister Rogers theme and a slew of Hollywood classics while going right into the crowd at the Dolby, the show looked like a winner.
Strolling out past hosts Steve Martin and Chris Rock out for a second consecutive hostless Oscars seemed like another smart play. Until the first Iowa Caucuses joke and audience shout-outs started with nominee Pitt, two-time winner Mahershala Ali and a string of lame swings at Jeff Bezos' expense. With those opening minutes fading fast in the creative twilight, it was then back to the future, in the most toothless way.
The fact is the immensely talented Martin and Rock were the hosts for all practical purposes with their pretty standard opening monologue - parts of which the latter supposedly practiced on an L.A. comedy stage Saturday night. In a predictable night of anticipated winners, Martin and Rock's blunted jabs at the sorrowful lack of women nominated in the Directing category and Harriet's Cynthia Erivo as the solo person of color nominated in the top acting categories would sadly have stood the test of almost any Oscars the past few years. Yet, the reality is the comics had little new to say for 2020, a year that was screaming out for relevance and opportunity.
To bring out ex-SNL duos like Bridesmaids co-stars Maya Rudolph and Kristen Wiig or Downhill's Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell and have them caught in a leg-hold trap of bad writing and clear network time-killing is a sin on any Sunday, but especially Oscar night. To remind us just how bad Cats was, James Corden's and Rebel Wilson's appearance in full furry regalia was the wind blowing through the awards shows graveyard of irrelevance. The fact that no one had the guts to even utter the words Harvey Weinstein, his victims or the fight of the #MeToo movement and Time's Up with the once powerful and now much accused producer currently on trial for rape in New York City right now only made Gervais' scathing words nearly lost at the end of the Golden Globes last month more biting.
Which means, at some point soon, if God is just in her Heaven, what constitutes an award show will have to meet the wrecking ball and be rebuilt. That effort of renewal will require much more than having or not having a host because of controversy, incompetence or hope of another ratings bounce. Sure, the way-too-long Oscars of tonight wasn't as much of a cluster as the Democrats' efforts to secure delegates in the Hawkeye State on February 3, but America's storytellers should know better to do so much better by now.
With another winning speech this awards season, Pitt's Best Supporting Actor win for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood saw a swing at the stunted impeachment of Donald Trump and the brakes Mitch McConnell and the Senate GOP put on witnesses such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Capping an impressive awards-season streak, a near birthday celebrating Dern brought the competitive crowd even further to her side with shout-outs to her heroes, her parents Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern.
Still, not even an Oscar-winning Elton John coming out in the last half hour to semi-fulfill the classic rock role that a semi-reunited Queen blasted out last year could hit the high notes that tonight needed.
In a show that drew heavily from Broadway's new talents and Zazie Beetz and hence had way more inclusion onstage than in the actual nominations, ads like past winner Regina King for Cadillac; Alejandro González Iñárritu, James Cameron, Kathryn Bigelow and Scorsese for Rolex; and a preview of the masterful Erivo in Nat Geo's Genius: Aretha offered a fresher take, and a more direct one, literally and figuratively.
And when the ads are the real stars, you really have a really serious problem Oscar - host or not. Or just give Olivia Colman the job and spare us another year of laments.

Aug 16, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  With film festivals in Venice, Telluride, and Toronto mere weeks away, the fall movie season is already upon us, and with it comes the real start of Oscar season. However, even as anticipation rises for many of the high profile offerings with the potential to gain awards momentum, there are several beloved 2019 films that already screened earlier this year and are eager to remain in the conversation. Case in point: Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite[1],' a darkly comic tale of class warfare, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes way back in May, but the film is about to relaunch in the heat of Oscar season with prime slots on the fall circuit. 
The critically acclaimed title seems like an obvious contender for Best International Film, but the film's distributor has much bigger plans. 'Parasite' is primed to receive a campaign in major categories — but will Academy voters see beyond its 'foreign language' status as they did for Alfonso Cuarón and 'Roma' last year? That's one of the big questions at the center of this week's Screen Talk[2] episode, as Eric Kohn and Anne Thompson anticipate the developing campaign.

'Parasite' Palme d'Or Winner Bong Joon-Ho On Pic's North Korea Jokes - Cannes
Deadline
May 25, 2019

Bong Joon-Ho's multi-genre comedy-thriller            Parasite takes aim at a number of themes occurring in our world, from class struggle to global warming.
But criticizing North Korea isn't one of the movie's dominant motifs according to the director. Parasite follows a struggling family who worm themselves into the good graces of a wealthy family, working in various servant and teaching roles. The entire experience goes south for the poor family.
In the movie there's a brief scene where a housekeeper impersonates North Korean state TV anchors with her husband, and also pokes fun at the country's dictator and its nuclear missile situation. It's a moment that earned great laughs from the audience at the Debussy Theatre during the pic's encore run at Cannes today.
"This should not be misconstrued as a serious message referring to North Korea," Joon-Ho told Deadline after we asked the director about the pic's jabs at the country, "It's just a small joke."
"There are a lot of comics in South Korea who make sketches on this topic, which is very common," said Joon-Ho about satirizing North Korea.
Also in the film, the wealthy family have a bunker below their famed architect-designed modern home.
"That also can be seen as a reference to a possible attack by North Korea," says Joon-Ho about the bunker scene, "I think if North Koreans see this, they'll laugh at the joke too."
NEON is distributing Parasite in the United States. Parasite has a 96% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 26 reviews. The movie reps the first Palme d'Or winner for South Korea.

Film review: Parasite****
Cyprus Mail
November 5, 2019 Tuesday

 Copyright 2019 Neo Cymed Publishing Limited All Rights Reserved
 
Length: 745 words

We waited years for a Japanese film to win the Golden Palm at Cannes then subsequently open in Cyprus cinemas, but it finally happened with Shoplifters. Then we waited one more year for a Korean film to win the Golden Palm and subsequently open in Cyprus cinemas – but it happens this week with Parasite. (We’ll actually have to wait a few more days; the film opens on Thursday at the Pantheon, with Greek and English subtitles.) The two films have more than a top festival award and geographical proximity in common. Both revolve around a slightly disreputable – but very close-knit – family of hustlers, though the tone is admittedly quite different. Shoplifters was cosy, humane, and a little bit staid; Parasite is a sharply satirical, highly enjoyable thriller with a good deal of swagger, if perhaps slightly hollow.
“This is so metaphorical,” young Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik) says more than once – and I guess it is, though it’s also rather blatant. Ki-woo and his family, the Kims, are the titular parasites, not just leeching off a wealthy family – the Parks – but caught in a symbiotic relationship: the Parks support the Kims, lifting them out of their squalid unemployed existence in a semi-basement flat, but in fact the Parks are happy to do it, blissfully unaware that their driver, their housekeeper, their daughter’s tutor and their son’s ‘art therapist’ all belong to the same family. “They smell the same!” says the little boy, picking up that semi-basement reek, but his parents are embarrassed. They’re parasites too, in a way, living empty lives off the backs of ordinary people.
It takes about 45 minutes for the scam to be set up, which is arguably too long. There’s a slightly laboured quality to the first act – though it gives us a chance to meet the Parks, hard-nosed Mr. Park who’s mostly fair-minded but doesn’t like his staff “crossing the line” and weak, rather gullible Mrs. Park, twittering on about her son’s artistic genius (“He has a Basquiat-esque sense, even at age 9!”). “She’s rich, but still nice,” marvels Mr. Kim later (he’s played by Song Kang-ho, probably the best-known of all Korean actors), but his wife disagrees: “Nice because she’s rich,” she corrects, adding that “money is an iron”, it takes out the creases. The Parks keep neuroses primly hidden, living on a hilltop and basking in the sunshine in their front garden; the Kims laugh and argue and live underground, with the rest of the basement-dwellers.
There’s a twist, of course, which I won’t spoil here. Director Bong Joon-ho dealt with class struggle before, in Snowpiercer, though in that film, which was set on a train, the physical divide was horizontal (front/back) whereas here it’s vertical (up/down). The only real question is where Parasite goes after establishing that divide – and it’s fair to say that it goes into anarchy, working-class solidarity turning out to be a chimera. A rain falls, the Kims’ seedy neighbourhood turned into waterlogged chaos (there’s a striking, orange-filtered shot of the dank Dickensian warren criss-crossed by cables; the very opposite of the clean lines in the Parks’ comfy home), then Mr. Kim – asked by his son what the plan is – wearily replies that there’s no plan, and that’s how it should be. “People shouldn’t make plans. With no plan, nothing can go wrong.” It doesn’t get more hopeless than that.
Parasite goes down easily enough; it doesn’t have the wild shifts of Snowpiercer, though the tone swings from knockabout comedy to shocking violence. Easy to see why such an accomplished movie won the top prize at Cannes (unanimously, too) – yet pinning it down remains elusive. Why the emphasis on performance (the kids coaching Mr. Kim on what to say, Kim pretending to be mad at his wife)? Is Bong’s point that everyone is acting, that class divisions are assigned roles more than anything? Yet the difference, in the end, boils down to something very visceral – that aforementioned smell, like “when you boil a rag” says Mr. Park, the smell of poverty and damp stuffy homes, the smell of people who go on the subway. It’s as though capitalism – the wealth gap, our polarised world in general – has created two different species, warily sniffing at each other in the jungle, able to live together but no longer recognising themselves in the other. Hopefully it’s all metaphorical.

So, should you see Parasite? A look at the first foreign language film ever to win Best Picture at the Oscars

South Korean drama Parasite made history on Sunday night, becoming the first foreign language film ever to win Best Picture at the 92nd Oscars. 
The film has been a critical hit since hitting U.S. theaters in November, with a whopping 99per cent Rotten Tomatoes rating from 393 reviews. And it has earned $165.3 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing South Korean film ever.
Even so, Parasite only grossed $35.4million in the U.S., so for those who may not be aware of the film, we're taking a deep dive into the historic Oscar winner.
Parasite is the seventh directorial effort of South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, whose previous films include Netflix's Okja (2017), indie thriller Snowpiercer (2014) and monster movie The Host (2006).
Parasite follows two families - the poor basement-dwelling Kim family (Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-sik, Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin) and the wealthy Park family (Lee Sun-kyun, Jo Yeo-jeong and Jung Ji-so) - whose lives intersect.
The Kim family infiltrate the lives of the Parks, first with the children becoming tutors for the wealthy offspring, before their scheming leads to the Kim matriarch and patriarch finding work in the household.
The film shows how both families serve as 'parasites' in different ways, with the Kims latching onto the Park's wealth, while the Parks exploit the Kims for cheap labor.
'Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant,' Bong said in an interview (via IGN).
'But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites,' the directed added.
The filmmaker largely found inspiration for Parasite in his own experiences in his 20s, when he worked as a tutor for a wealthy family.
Director Bong told The Hollywood Reporter that he was introduced to the wealthy family by his girlfriend and future wife Jung Sun-young, who was already tutoring the family's son in English, but needed a math tutor.
'They wanted another tutor for math, so she put me forward as a trustworthy friend, even though I was actually really bad at math,' Bong said.
The filmmaker was also inspired by French sisters Christine and Lea Papin, French maids who murdered their employers in 1930s France.
Production took place between May 2018 and September 2018, largely within a massive house created and built for the film by production designer Lee Ha Jun. 
'They want to show off that they have this sophisticated taste,' Bong told Architectural Digest in a profile about the sprawling house built for the film.
Parasite had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, where it became the first Korean film ever to win the top award at the festival, the prestigious Palme d'Or.
It was also the first film to be unanimously selected as the Palme d'Or by the Cannes jury since 2013's Blue is the Warmest Color.
The film was released in South Korea on May 30, where it became the highest-grossing film ever in its native country. 
Parasite was released in the United States on October 11 in limited release, where it received rave reviews and became the first South Korean film ever to be nominated for Best International Feature Film.
The movie earned a whopping $392,216 in its U.S. opening weekend from just three theaters for a per-screen average of $131,072, the highest ever for a foreign-language film.
Despite a rather limited rollout, only expanding into over 1,000 theaters until late January, Parasite has still earned $35.4 million at the domestic box office. 
Parasite was nominated for six Oscars, winning four - Best Picture (producers Kwak Sin-ae Kwak, Bong Joon-ho), Best Director (Bong Joon-ho), Best Original Screenplay (Bong Joon-ho, Jin Wan-han) and Best International Feature Film.
It also became the first foreign language film to win Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and just the second film to win the Palm d'Or and Best Picture, since Marty in 1955.
Among its other accolades are Best Film Not in the English Language and Best Original Screenplay at the BAFTAs and Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes.

Can 'Parasite' break Asian film's last US barrier?
Asia Times-English

Highlight: With a Korean film poised for Oscar glory, AT reviews the trials, tribulations and triumphs of Asian cinema in Hollywood  
Body




Could South Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s wickedly incisive black comedy Parasite lift the 2020 “Best Foreign Language Film” at the Academy Awards in February – or even the “Best Picture” Oscar?
The odds are steep. A handful of Japanese and one Taiwanese film have won the former title, but Parasite would be the first non-English-language film ever to win the latter category. Still, signs are promising. On Sunday, Parasite topped off a rich awards season that includes aCannes Palme D'Or by becoming the first foreign-language film ever to win a            Screen Actor's Guild ensemble prize – analogous to the Oscar's "Best Picture" honor.
Regardless of win or loss, the fact that an Asian work is in contention for the English-speaking world’s most prestigious film award suggests Asia’s soft power is finally catching up with its hard power:  In terms of economic clout, East Asia is on a par with the EU and North America.
Since World War II, Asia-specific genres – city-crushing monsters, swashbuckling samurai, kung fu fighters, dreamy animes – have both enriched and influenced global cinema. Asian filmmakers have packed US mainstream theaters with actioners and art houses with quality films; a handful of Asian actors have won global icon status.
But US acceptance has been a long time coming.
Asians suffered from racial stereotypes, watched white actors don “yellowface” and are now seeing “whitewashing” of not just Asian characters, but entire movies. Asian films have been impacted by dire dubbing and the curse of the subtitle. Prejudice has impacted actors and auteurs.
Now, as digitization hurdles both national and cultural frontiers, and as new forms of distribution come online, there are realistic hopes for a better tomorrow.
In 2000,  Ang Lee’s Chinese fantasia Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon dissolved the barrier between critical and mainstream acceptance for a defiantly all-Asian film – complete with Asian actors, themes, aesthetics and subtitles – by bagging four Oscars.
Two decades later, Parasite’ssix nominations indicate Americans are open to non-genre Asian films. The movie, though Asia-set, addresses a universal issue: middle-class angst amid income polarization. And signs are promising that it could seize the big one.
With Parasite on the brink of the biggest-ever success for Asian cinema in the Anglophone hyperpower that hosts the world’s mightiest film industry, Asia Times reviews the trials, tribulations and triumphs of Asian film in Hollywood.

 ‘Yellow peril’ and ‘yellow face’
Almost entirely forgotten today, one of the first heartthrobs of Hollywood’s silent era was Kintaro Hakakawa (1886-1973). A Japanese-American, he wielded a brooding set of good looks that swept him through decades of film following his 1915 debut The Cheat.
“Historically, Hollywood framed Asians within the ‘Yellow Peril’ framework and Asians were not considered for leading roles,” Aaron Han Joon Magnan-Park, a film expert at the University of Hong Kong told Asia Times. “Hayakawa was an exception to this….his ancestry made him not completely ‘yellow’ since Japan was the only imperial power within the 'white-only club' following victory in the Russo-Japanese War.”
It would be decades before another Asian would enjoy such a positive profile on US screens.
In a century that saw Asian colonies demand (and win) independence from European powers, and battle Western soldiers in a trio of murderous East Asian wars, the “Yellow Peril” became a 20th-century Western fear. It was reflected in cinematic representations that are, by 21st century standards, damningly prejudiced.
•	White man, beware! A (not very Asian) Fu Manchu is up to no good. Video: YouTube.
Most notorious was the Fu Manchu series, based on the novels by Edwardian Sax Rohmer. The series, which flourished in both the 1930s and the 1960s, featured a Chinese super-villain whose army of assassins – comprising Arabs, Chinese and Indians – deployed such nefarious weapons as venomous snakes, poisonous spiders and plague bacilli.
Reinforcing the un-reality of the series, the villain was not played by an Asian, but by white actors – notably, horror movie stalwarts Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee – made up to look vaguely Asian. This practice of “yellowface” would rob Asian actors of countless roles.
White actors played one of the few positive Asian characters of 1930s Hollywood – Chinese detective Charlie Chan – but the most notorious example of yellowface was a 1956 film portraying history’s most powerful Asian – one who had generated centuries of European folk memory of real “yellow peril.” In Howard Hughes’ The Conqueror,Genghis Khan, played by Hollywood veteran John Wayne, stormed across Utah. The so-called "Oriental Western" today generates both bitterness and ridicule and is a staple on "Worst Films of all Time” lists.

s
Not all Asians were portrayed as perilous. In 1958, Mickey Rooney placed a doltish, buck-toothed and myopic Japanese photographer in Breakfast at Tiffany’s; 13 years after the atomic bomb had detonated, Hollywood was still producing World War II-style ethnic caricatures. Rooney’s character, “Mr. Yunioshi,” became such an icon of racial offensiveness that in a 2008 newspaper interview, Rooney apologized.
None of these portrayals were products of Asian cinema – and by the 1950s, far-sighted Western viewers were starting to look toward the real East.
Swashbuckling samurai, city-stomping monsters
In 1952, a motion picture featuring a compelling plot, forceful characters, brilliant actors, superb lighting and roving camerawork hit Tokyo screens. Today, it is considered one of the greatest films of all time, its director one of the greatest auteurs ever.
•	The ultimatechanbara: Seven Samurai. Video: YouTube
s
The film opened overseas eyes to Japan’s chanbara(“sword-fighting”) cinema. Other Kurosowa chanbaraclassics include 1950’s Rashomon (winner of the“Best Foreign Language Film” Oscar in 1952), Throne of Blood (1957) and Yojimbo (1961). Other chanbarawould win niche Western audiences, notably the Zatoichi “Blind Swordsman” movies, the ludicrously bloody “Lone Wolf and Cub” series and the kinkier "Nemuri Kyoshiri/Son of Black Mass" series.
Beyond genre film, Kurosawa's mastery of cinematography would be hugely influential. So would his films. Seven Samurai was remade in the US as The Magnificent Seven, a classic Western; Yojimbowas remade in Spain as A Fistful of Dollars,a classic “spaghetti Western.” The two remakes launched a plethora of Hollywood stars, while the original provided a star vehicle for Toshiro Mifune, who would achieve a modest Hollywood breakthrough.
A very different Asian star arose in 1954. Ishiro Honda's Godzilla (a Japanese portmanteau of whale and gorilla), an irradiated, dinosaur-like sea-dragon, crushed Tokyo under his clawed feet – then, in a rash of sequels, defended earth from outlandish, invading monsters. The “guy-in-a-rubber monster suit” would became a kitschy, beloved icon of Asian cinema, eventually trampling American cities in a series of remakes that, despite their CGI, lacked the charm of the originals. The franchise has generated 35 films thus far; it is still going strong.

s
Samurai were not the only eastern warriors to fascinate American filmgoers. In the 1970s, another Asian combative culture would travel West – via celluloid.
Rise of the kung fu superhero
The 1960s brought counter-culture to the US. A new open-mindedness toward things Asian became visible in cuisine, music and religion – and martial arts.
Japan’s judo and karate, and Korea’s taekwondo, globalized in the 1950s and 1960s , partly due to American servicemen learning them in Asia and their promotion as combat sports. China’s secretive kung fu would win fame not via sport but via cinema.
The 1970s birthed not just a new genre, but the first-ever Third World superstar. Hong Kong’s Bruce Lee came to America in 1959. Personally charismatic, he taught kung fu to Hollywood professionals who recognized his potential.
Lee’s contacts won him TV bit parts – notably as the white hero’s high-kicking sidekick in The Green Hornet – but his hopes of being the hero of a series about a Shaolin monk wandering the 19th century American West were dashed: He was considered “too Asian” for the role. (It went to US actor David Carradine, who – despite his inability at martial arts – made it his own in the TV series Kung Fu.)
Lee returned to Hong Kong to leverage his Green Hornet fame in a newly thriving film scene. In 1972, the Shaw Brothers kung fu film Five Fingers of Death had taken the top spot at the American box office – the first foreign film to achieve the feat, Magnan-Park noted. Shaw had set up cinemas in Chinatowns worldwide, and from thence, kung fu films went global.
•	Five Fingers of Death kicked off the global kung fu movie boom. Video: YouTube
s
In Hong Kong, Lee made three superior kung fu flicks for Raymond Chow’s new Golden Harvest studios. They outdid their contemporaries by showcasing Lee’s martial skills, ripped physique and undeniable charisma. Hollywood took note. Lee got the call.
The result was 1973’s Hong Kong-Hollywood co-production Enter the Dragon. Combining Lee, black and white co-stars, a Hong Kong location and US production values, it was an instant global hit, one of the finest action films ever.
At a stroke, Lee had demolished stereotypes.
Previously, “Asian men were presented either as lecherous villains, emasculated into sexual non-entities or allowed to be the good racial sidekick to the white alpha male hero,” said Magnan-Park. “All this changed with Bruce Lee.”
“Bruce Lee was the tipping point,” agreed Michael Hurt,  Social Science Korea research professor at the Center for Glocal Culture and Social Empathy at the University of Seoul. “The representation of Asians shifted away from passive and sexless to a kind of hyper-masculine manly mode – he was a kung fu badass.”
But Lee never enjoyed superstardom; he died, aged 32, of a brain aneurism, pre-release. Early death enshrined him in legend. To this day, he is recognized worldwide as the 20th century’s greatest Asian cultural icon.

s
A handful of copycats came and went before “the next Bruce Lee” emerged.
Jackie Chan had been an extra in Enter the Dragon, but he – along with Chinese Opera chums Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao – did not follow Lee’s macho formula. Instead, Chan blended zany slapstick and jaw-dropping physical stunt work to kung fu, conveying the genre triumphantly into the 1980s. His fame would lead to a series of Hong Kong-Hollywood co-productions in the 1990s and 2000s.
Other martial arts stars would follow: China’s Jet Li, Thailand’s Tony Jaa, Indonesia’s Iko Uwais and Chinese-American Donnie Yen. Women, too, would get their kicks, notably Malaysia’s Michelle Yeoh and China’s Zhang Ziyi.
Human waves 
Following the positive developments in Asian cinema in 1970s, there was a backlash in Hollywood portrayals of Asians in the US as the decade wound down.
Between the 1940s and 1970s, American troops discovered Asians could fight. The enemy was racially demonized: The “Japs” (World War II), the “Chinks” and “Gooks” (Korea) and the “Dinks” (Vietnam). The latter became filmic whipping boys as the US wrestled with post-traumatic Vietnam distress.
“Asians became reduced to their most simplistic forms,” said Hurt. “Simplistic cartoon characters – in simplistic revenge fantasies.”
Asians were largely invisible in the best Vietnam pictures, such as Platoon(1986) and Apocalypse Now(1979). In others, such as The Deer Hunter (1978) they were deeply villainous. In others, they were mere cannon fodder – notably in Slyvester Stallone’s Rambo(1985), in which the righteous white hero refights (and wins) the Vietnam War.
In a similar vein, an actor incubated by Bruce Lee – American karate champion Chuck Norris – avenged his death at Lee’s hands in the climactic duel in Way of the Dragon (1972) by mowing down hordes of yellow and brown extras in a series of 1980s and 1990s B-movies.
•	Prepare to die, hundreds of Asian extras – Chuck Norris is on set. Video: YouTube
s
A new hero/villain also emerged: the ninja. The shadow assassins of feudal Japan clearly fascinated US audiences, but the sub-genre lacked a Kurosawa or Lee; the leading ninja actor, Sho Kosugi, never elevated the genre above shlock.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong cinema was shifting. Highly stylized, noir gangster flicks, borrowing from chanbara, kung fu and Sam Peckinpah's appeared. Blending expertly choreographed, ultra-violent, slow-motion gunplay with emotively melodramatic plots, this was the “heroic bloodshed” or “gun fu” genre.
A Better Tomorrow (1986), 1987'sA Better Tomorrow 2 and 1989’s The Killer brought a new Asian star, Alain Delon-ish Chow Yun Fat, and a new Asian director, John Woo, to global attention. Both would transition to Hollywood.

s
Amid the gunsmoke and splatter, the decade also saw the emergence of a world-beating studio that would produce some of the finest work in a gentler Asia genre.

Nearly all of the night's winners are available online to stream, rent or buy. Here's at look at what they are and where to find them.
For Oscar viewers eager to catch up with Bong Joon Ho's ''Parasite,'' the first-ever non-English-language film to win Best Picture, the timing could not be better for streaming, because it's just become available for rental. In fact, save for ''Little Women,'' ''1917'' and ''Bombshell,'' which only won in technical categories, every Oscar winner is currently streaming for a fee in digital media stores or on subscription services, and two of the three shorts are posted for free on YouTube. Bong's twisty genre hybrid about a con that metastasizes into class warfare should be a priority, but it will be easier than usual to find out if the Academy got it right. 
  'Parasite'
  Won for: Best picture, director, original screenplay, international feature
  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  An underclass family infiltrates the home of a much wealthier clan in Bong Joon Ho's impeccably orchestrated allegory about social inequality, which mixes and matches black comedy, social satire and the white-knuckle tension of a thriller. The less known about the plot, the better, given the escalating series of twists that Bong pulls off as the lives of his characters become more closely intertwined. His willingness to play with different genres and tones will be familiar to fans of his previous work, like ''The Host'' and ''Snowpiercer,'' but rarely have they been more smoothly integrated.

  'Joker'
  Won for: Best actor, original score
  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  Films based on DC Comics have tended to go darker than their Marvel counterparts, but ''Joker'' goes one step further, dispensing of the standard conflicts between hero and villain in favor of a deeper sociological bent. Anchored by Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck, a part-time clown and full-time mope who lives with his ailing mother in Gotham City, the film grafts the urban alienation of Martin Scorsese's ''Taxi Driver'' and ''The King of Comedy'' onto the origin story of DC's most famous villain. Where Heath Ledger's Joker in ''The Dark Knight'' reflects a broken system, Phoenix's Joker is the product of it.

  'Judy'
  Won for: Best actress
  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  The Academy loves a splashy biopic performance, and Renée Zellweger locks into a doozy in Judy Garland, the transcendently gifted singer and actress whose triumphs on stage and screen were darkened by mental health issues and substance abuse. Rather than cover the full scope of her life, ''Judy'' focuses on her last year, when Garland's sour reputation in America brings her to London in 1968. There, her efforts to revive her career are undermined by her persistent addiction. Zellweger captures both her vulnerably and her volatility as she struggles to put on one last great show.

  'Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood'
  Won for: Best supporting actor, production design
  Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  When it was announced that Quentin Tarantino was going to make a film about Charles Manson and the Sharon Tate murders, surely no one expected anything like ''Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,'' which builds to that fateful night on Cielo Drive, but approaches it from a side angle. Through the fictional characters of the fading Western star Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his faithful stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), Tarantino revivifies Hollywood in the summer of '69 and captures its turbulent undercurrents with the sensitivity of a seismograph. Before the inevitable spasms of violence, the film is a bittersweet elegy for the end of an era.
  [Read the New York Times review.]
  'Marriage Story'
  Won for: Best supporting actress
  Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
  Divorce has colored the life and work of the writer-director Noah Baumbach, and he brings all that experience to bear on ''Marriage Story,'' a comedy-drama about the agonies and possibilities of uncoupling. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are both superb as a creative couple who cannot come to terms amicably on their own, so they engage in an emotionally and financially costly legal dispute. Baumbach makes an enemy of the process, which brings out the worst in both of them, but even the lawyers have a human dimension, especially Laura Dern as a powerful L.A. attorney who approaches the job with empathy and aggression.
  [Read the New York Times review.]
  'Jojo Rabbit'
  Won for: Best adapted screenplay
  Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  Turning Adolf Hitler into a little boy's imaginary friend sounds like an unworkable conceit, but Taika Waititi's nervy crowd-pleaser treats Der Führer as a Beatles-like phenomenon that whipped young people like Jojo Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) into a nationalist frenzy. Jojo's time in a Hitler Youth camp is like watching ''Moonrise Kingdom'' with Nazis, but Waititi undercuts the absurdity by detailing the boy's relationship with a Jewish girl his mother (Scarlett Johansson) has hidden behind his bedroom walls. In the battle for his conscience, Hitler proves to be a formidable adversary.

  'American Factory'
  Won for: Best documentary
  Where to watch: Stream it on Netflix.
  When the Chinese glass company Fuyao reopens a Dayton, Ohio factory that once housed General Motors, many former G.M. employees return to the work force with the hope of renewed prosperity and cross-cultural harmony. The filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar are present for that optimistic moment and they stay through the difficulties that follow, as differences in work ethic, employee safety and compensation open up a rift between Chinese management and disgruntled American line workers. The promise and peril of this globalist experiment is evoked through Reichert and Bognar's compassionate eye.

  'Toy Story 4'
  Won for: Best animated feature
  Where to watch: Stream it on Disney Plus. Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  The breakout character in this Pixar sequel is Forky, a humble and dimwitted little spork with pipe-cleaner arms, misaligned googly eyes and Popsicle sticks for feet. He's a charming creation who doubles a signal for the low-stakes ambition of ''Toy Story 4,'' which includes the expected Rube Goldberg set pieces and heartstring-tugging of the previous three, but feels more like a stand-alone adventure. Here Woody and the gang are waylaid at a carnival, where they reunite with Little Bo Peep, but have to face the possibility that life may send them on separate destinies.

  'Hair Love'
  Won for: Best animated short
  Where to watch: Stream it on YouTube.
  From Kickstarter phenomenon to Oscar winner, ''Hair Love,'' directed by Matthew A. Cherry, Everett Downing Jr. and Bruce W. Smith, is about nothing more than a black father struggling to style his daughter's seemingly untamable hair. But within that simple premise, played for equal parts whimsy and sentiment, the movie tells a story about black confidence and identity as well as the rewarding hard work of parenthood. Father and daughter don't say a word to each other. They don't need to.

  'The Neighbor's Window'
  Won for: Best live-action short
  Where to watch: Stream it on YouTube.
  After three nominations for documentary Oscars -- including one for ''Street Fight,'' about a young Cory Booker's insurgent campaign for mayor of Newark -- the director Marshall Curry finally wins one for a tight piece of short fiction that uses a ''Rear Window'' scenario to reflect on a rocky marriage. Maria Dizzia and Greg Keller star as the beleaguered parents of young children who naturally get jealous when a good-looking, amorous couple moves into the building across the street and doesn't bother to put up drapes. But that grass-is-greener feeling dissipates as the strangers they're watching turn out to have more complicated lives than they initially believe.

  'Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl)'
  Won for: Best documentary short
  Where to watch: Stream it on Hulu.
  Founded in 2007, the nonprofit organization Skateistan has included skateboarding as part of a larger educational mission to serve disadvantaged children in Afghanistan, South Africa and Cambodia, 50% of them girls. Carol Dysinger's 40-minute documentary short narrows the focus to Kabul, Afghanistan, where a brutal patriarchy has persisted after the Taliban. Many girls are denied access to schools and face restrictive and often violent conditions at home. At a secure facility, they're taught how to read and write, but as the title promises, there are skateboarding lessons, too, intended to empower and delight them.
  'Ford v. Ferrari'
  Won for: Best editing, sound editing
  Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  The ultimate in Dad-friendly entertainment for a Sunday afternoon, James Mangold's muscular gear head drama about the quest for supremacy between automakers in 1966 stays squarely within its lane, banking on nitro-charged racing sequences and old-fashioned star turns by Matt Damon and Christian Bale. Damon plays car designer Carroll Shelby, who's commissioned by the Ford Motor Company to build a car fast enough to defeat the dominant Ferrari fleet at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. With the volatile Ken Miles (Bale) as his driver, Carroll and his team of engineers put together a winner through hard work, sweat and a lot of spit and bubble gum.
  [Read the New York Times review.]
  'Rocketman'
  Won for: Best Original Song
  Where to watch: Buy it on iTunes. Rent it on Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube.
  If this Elton John biopic feels like a more well-engineered piece of craftsmanship than last year's Queen biopic ''Bohemian Rhapsody,'' it might be because Dexter Fletcher, who replaced Bryan Singer as the director of the earlier film late in production, was on board here from the beginning. ''Rocketman'' defies precisely none of the genre's clichés, but the ascendence of young Reginald Dwight into the pop legend better known as Elton John is a satisfying arc nonetheless. Taron Egerton's robust lead performance is one reason, but classic singles like ''Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting,'' ''Crocodile Rock'' and ''Your Song'' give it the quality of a jukebox musical.

JAMIE EAST AT THE MOVIES Korean comedy Parasite is the most entertaining film of the year

                     THIS is the one you have heard so much about for the past few months.                   
Groaning under the weight of this much critical acclaim usually indicates pomposity, arthouse incomprehensibility . . . or that it has been made by Marvel.
However, this dark, twisted, subtitled black comedy from South Korea completely lives up to expectations. It is utterly marvellous.
To be honest, you are better off knowing as little as possible about the film before you go in. Just let the madness unfurl, taking you on a very wild ride.
If you don't need persuading with a rundown of the plot, skip ahead a few paragraphs.
For those who need a little encouragement, here is what we have to play with. The Kims are a family of four living in poverty in a Seoul basement, contending with people urinating outside their window.
They rely on the government to fumigate the streets, so they in turn can leave their window open to get the roaches out of their flat and carry on nicking free wifi from upstairs. It is a grim existence and they are fed up with it.
When an opportunity arises for the son to teach English to the daughter of a rich businessman, they hatch a cunning plan to infiltrate their lives and leech as much as they can.
They are grifters, chancers, liars and thieves - and you will root for them every step of the way. In stark contrast, the Parks are super-cool, super-rich and happy but vacant.
You don't dislike them but their ambivalence towards the lower classes grates throughout.
As the Kims worm their way into the (very cool) house, replacing the staff one by one, you have no clue which way it will play out - and nothing really prepares you for the path it chooses.
                     BRACE YOURSELF                   
It is completely gripping. Director Bong Joon-ho displays incredible dexterity here.
On the face of it, this is a farcical black comedy at its centre, with a crispy thriller coating.
Yet it is the social and political statements around the class divide that give it real bite.
Thanks to his incredible track record (he was responsible for the wonderful Okja, for instance) one of the most satisfying elements of this film's success is that it will almost certainly avoid the standard Western remake.
This is good news, as its Korean origins are what gives Parasite its sharp edges. In Western culture, we rarely reflect the disparity of the classes in quite the same way.
That is not to say it isn't as harsh elsewhere. But the basement-dwelling culture is synonymous with cities such as Seoul.
And for us sanitised Westerners, the unfamiliar surroundings - coupled with the familiar glossy-mag Grand Designs minimalism - really work.
Believe the plaudits, get your arse to the cinema and brace yourself for the most entertaining movie of the year.
                     Parasite (15) 132mins

Review: 'Parasite's' Surprise Wins Saved an Otherwise Frantic Oscars Ceremony
Variety
February 10, 2020

The 92nd annual Academy Awards quickly lost its own plot amid a million distractions courtesy of ABC's frenetic, often baffling production decisions. But then, through the sheer pleasure of the groundbreaking winners of "Parasite" breaking through the expected narrative to triumph, the show became something far more beautifully chaotic than the show's producers could have hoped for. 
For about half the broadcast, the Oscars felt like a train that got jogged off its tracks. With most of the winners seemingly set in stone, ABC packed the night with presenters and performances to distract from what looked to be a predictable night, which only made the proceedings feel more crowded than ever. (In fairness: one aspect outside ABC's control is the fact that this year's original song nominees were especially uninspiring, which the elaborate stagings of every number, as well as bonus performances from artists like Janelle Monae and Billie Eilish, did their best to mask.)
Going host-less for the second year running ostensibly puts more pressure on the presenters, some of whom inevitably fared better than others. But the show's emphasis on not just presenters, but (younger) presenters for the (more established) presenters, seriously pushed the limits of what constitutes a high value cameo. I've always wanted to know who networks think they're luring into an awards show broadcast thanks to some star power reading the categories, and this round's especially strange attempts confirm that awards shows are especially prone to the "more is more" approach, regardless of logic. 
There's just no reason, for instance, that "Booksmart" star Beanie Feldstein shouldn't have presented alongside Mindy Kaling instead of alerting the audience to Kaling's presence. "1917" breakout George McKay truly needn't have thrown to Olivia Colman from the tippy top of the Dolby Theater. Most importantly, and perhaps in the most perfect summary of just how bizarre the night got by the halfway mark, who on earth suggested that Anthony Ramos introduce Lin-Manuel Miranda, so Lin-Manuel Miranda could introduce a montage of popular movies and the songs they made famous, which in turn introduced none other than Eminem performing the entirety of his 2002 Oscar-winning song "8 Mile," for no other reason than he didn't get the chance before and that has a new album to promote? By the time Utkarsh Ambudkar was rapping about what had already happened in the ceremony so far, in a tepid reboot of Neil Patrick Harris' go to closing bit for the Tonys, it seemed like the show had completely lost the thread. 
But towards the end of the night, a double whammy of surprise wins changed the tide of the night and show, ABC's forced idea of fun be damned. After picking up Oscars for original screenplay and international feature (and giving two distinctly funny and poignant speeches), a visibly shocked Bong Joon Ho took best director - and then "           Parasite" won best picture, becoming the first international feature to ever do so. The rush of joy accompanying each win, Bong's open shock, the room's delight at a supposedly set awards season narrative falling apart in front of their eyes all combined to make the kind of thrilling moments that can only happen on live TV when all the best laid plans have been long left by the wayside. 
There's maybe no better metaphor for when ABC, no doubt sweating bullets as the show approached its three-and-a-half hour mark, tried to go dark on the winding final speeches from the "Parasite" team, only to have the audience (led by front row fanatics Charlize Theron and Tom Hanks) erupt in a chant of "up! up!" until the poor control booth relented and put the house lights back on to let the winners finish their thoughts. Unlike James Corden and Rebel Wilson's rambling "Cats" banter, this sharp left turn from the expected course of events wasn't exactly in ABC's plans, but it really couldn't have asked for a better finale than it accidentally got. Nothing written in advance could beat the sight of deserving winners basking in their victory while sharing pointed, personal insight on why the wins mean so much. 
Put another way: the late-breaking "Parasite" run brought the kind of shock to the system and refreshing verve that only a live event like the Oscars can - and after almost three hours of frantic vamping, a downright relief.

Two of the night's most talked about films are about to hit the big screen in the emirates

If Sunday's Golden Globe awards have left you excited for all things film, the good news is that you'll be able to see some of the winning titles in the UAE very soon.
While some of the night's big winners, such as Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood and Joker, have already hit screens around the world, others are yet to make it to the UAE big screen.
One of the night's most talked about winners was Korean film Parasite, which took the Golden Globe for best foreign language film, the first South Korean movie to ever win in the event's 77-year history.
Directed by Bong-Joon Ho, Parasite is a parable of class, family and privilege, centred around a poor Korean family that insinuates itself into the lives of a wealthy family.
Accepting the award, Bong Joon-ho said, via a translator, "Once you overcome the one inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."
The film debuted in October to rave reviews, leading it to be named the year's best film by the National Society of Film Critics. However, Parasite will premiere at cinemas across the UAE on Thursday, January 16.
Taking home the biggest prize of the night was 1917, the First World War epic directed by Sam Mendes, who was also named best director for the picture, which is made to look as though it has been filmed in one continuous shot. The ambitious picture was named Best Motion Picture – Drama, beating the likes of The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit, and Marriage Story.

Mendes's film took the prize ahead of its global cinema release, which will no doubt entice movie fans to theatres in their droves when it is released in the UAE on Thursday, January 9. It should also stand it in good stead ahead of the Oscars, which are set to take place in February.

In the final moments of Oscars 2020, when Jane Fonda was on the brink of announcing the most-awaited awards, Shakespeare's words: 'All the world's a stage' literally came true.
With South Korea's most talked about film of the year, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, bagging the most prestigious and celebrated token: Academy Award for Best Picture, a Korean chapter was added to the history of Cinema. It is the first masterpiece in a foreign language film to have won the honour.
Critics, movie buffs and admirers across the world had waited for this revolutionary acknowledgement for decades and since February 10, they haven't stopped going gaga over the most unexpected surprise of almost a century for the cinematic universe.
While Parasite also won Best International Film, Bong won Best Original Screenplay accolade and Best Director, beating legends such as Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Sam Mendes and Todd Phillips.
And why not? Direction-wise, Bong used his directorial skills with prominence, making him worthy of the honour. The by-product of his cast and crews' efforts is no less than a marvel to classic movie lovers. By creating this grand work of art by ticking off all the theoretical yet practical elements of story-telling, he and the film will no doubt go down as an integral part of the movie-making curriculum. Let's not take away the fact that the film indeed fulfilled the basics and key features of filmmaking. Not just this, Joon-ho also seems to well speak the language of cinema - be it Akira Kurosawa's or Alfred Hitchcock's.
After having given birth to K-pop, a whole new genre of music, this may very well be a turning point for Korean Cinema. But is it for movies in general especially when I see Sam Mendes's war epic 1917 NOT being named the Best Picture from the eight other novelty artworks nominated in the same category?
The painfully beautiful story of 1917 deserves the tag more than any other film (or equally for those who are emotional about the winner) for the tragic magic the one-shot movie created on screen. The movie running at three paces - visually, mentally and musically, was no short of a slow poison that brings to life hope by the end of it all. Even while playing on screen, 1917 is a reminder of the breakthrough techniques used to make cinema live up-to-date, eventually making it timeless.
Hitting the highest note of cinematic experience, the camera perspective made its audience the biggest part of the story-telling. No credits to that too? It also looked the biggest creation of all times, so far, for it seemed to also be a musical parody like Dunkirk, giving goosebumps sometimes with sound effects alone.
Surreal yet creepily real, mind-bending and heart orgasmic, 1917 is a tale running against time; there is no reason why this was not better than any of the eight films nominated: Ford v Ferrari, The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit, Joker, Little Women, Marriage Story, 1917, Once Upon A Time In...Hollywood and Parasite, of course.
Everything apart, what is done is done and if you go by reviews particularly after 1917 was nominated in key Golden Globe categories (because that's exactly when the film's power came to light), there are chances you will believe the movie was worth winning the biggest Oscar.
But isn't the timing a little off, say by a year? Flashback to the event ceremony a year ago, when Alfonso Cuaron's Spanish film Roma was the most likely to have won the Best Picture title but lost only to Greenbook, a take on African American racism. Call it political, inclusive or a move to break stereotypes, it seems change is for the better.

 Bong Joon-ho's story of the antics of a down-on-their-luck clan as they inveigle themselves into the lives of a wealthy family is an unsettling exploration of greed and class
Parasite (15) ****
 Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) (15) ***
 Dolittle (PG) *
 Bong Joon-ho's Bafta-winning and Oscar-nominated Parasite sees the South Korean genre master return to home territory with a darkly amusing and disturbing social horror film about a fallen-on-hard-times family insinuating themselves into the lives of a much wealthier clan. Swiftly establishing the resourcefulness of its marginalised protagonists, the film's richly metaphorical opening introduces us to the Kim family living a somewhat subterranean existence in a basement apartment where they filch free wi-fi from neighbours and nearby coffee shops and endure the choking fits that come from leaving the windows of their insect-infested home open while the streets above are being fumigated. 
  Scraping together a meagre living folding pizza boxes, their fortunes soon take a turn for the better when the son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), bluffs his way into a job as an English language tutor for the teenage daughter of the tech-rich Park family. Exploiting the gullibility of his new employers, Ki-woo's father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin) and sister (Park So-dam) waste no time engineering ways to usurp the Park household's other domestic staff, a task they execute with a ruthless efficiency that's both awful and amusing. 
 Here Bong is careful not to demonise or valorise either family; as a filmmaker he's less interested in finger-wagging admonishments than he is in taking us to uncomfortable places with outré plot twists that deepen and reframe what we think we know about the characters. Setting the action mostly within the sleek confines of the Park family's modernist home, he makes great use of the film's location to emphasise the ingrained feelings of superiority and inferiority that exist within his characters. As resentments build and the professionally courteous line between employers and employees is crossed in at first subtle but then shocking ways, what lingers is the way the film's title increasingly refers to the complexities of a world that feeds off the simple dreams of anyone with a vested interest in improving their status and protecting what they've got. 
 Of all DC's attempts to create an extended cinematic universe to rival Marvel's, 2016's super-villian team-up Suicide Squad was the worst: a crass slice of corporate edginess that couldn't even capitalise on having the Joker (then played by Jared Leto) in its roster of reprobates. Its one bright spark was Margot Robbie's histrionically unhinged turn as the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn, a punky, baseball-bat-wielding psycho wholly subservient to her beau's anarchic worldview. It makes sense, then, that in an effort to keep the franchise going Robbie's character should get her own interim spin-off movie ahead of next year's sequel. (For all its flaws, Suicide Squad still made close to $750m.) As the parenthetically elongated title suggests, Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn) is a deliberately over-the-top attempt to make something true to the gonzo spirit of the character as she frees herself from the literal and figurative toxicity of her chemical-plant-forged romance with the Crown Prince of Crime. 
 Striking out on her own, Robbie's cackling, kill-crazy kook now finds herself facing a slew of vendetta-hungry criminals no longer worried about reprisals from her ex. Chief among these is Ewan McGregor's campy gangster, Roman Sionis, a sadistic nightclub owner whose bid to take over Gotham City's criminal underworld forces Harley into an uneasy allegiance with a crossbow-wielding assassin (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a hard-bitten cop (Rosie Perez), an ass-kicking nightclub singer (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) and a teenage pick-pocket (Ella Jay Basco). Here, newbie director Cathy Yan and Bumblebee screenwriter Christina Hodson give Gotham City a Day-Glo makeover in keeping with their anti-heroine and, likewise, they adopt an insouciant attitude to violence that recalls the self-aware, fourth-wall-breaking style of Deadpool, albeit with shallow comic-book feminism replacing shallow comic-book nihilism. The end result is occasionally entertaining and frequently enervating. 
 The 1967 musical version of Dr Dolittle hastened the end of the old studio system. The 1998 comedy version gave Eddie Murphy's career a second wind. The most notable thing about the new Robert Downey Jr version is the Iron Man star's decision to follow his career-defining role driving one of the most successful, industry changing franchises in movie history with such a badly conceived and poorly made family film. Like previous iterations, Dolittle is loosely based on British author Hugh Lofting's early 20th century children's stories about a physician who realises he can talk to animals. Aside from an intriguing opening that introduces us to Dolittle as a grief-stricken recluse living in a country mansion with a menagerie of exotic animal pals, the film fails to enchant on any level. 
 Downey Jr's wandering Welsh accent is the first stumbling block, though the chief blame surely lies with writer/director Stephen Gaghan. Better known for scripting taut, Oscar-winning political thrillers such as Traffic and Syriana (which he also directed), he's got no feel for effects-heavy adventure films. Built around a dull plot involving Dolittle's globe-trotting quest to save the Queen of England (played by Jessie Buckley), this is little more than a series of chaotic set-pieces full of shoddily rendered CGI. Vocal and live-action cameos from the likes of Ralph Fiennes, Antonio Banderas, Rami Malek and Emma Thompson add little to a film in which the comic highpoint is Downey Jr pulling a set of bagpipes from a grumpy dragon's rear end.

'Joker' and 'Parasite' tap into fascination with anti-hero

Donald Trump and his family and friends saw the hit movie "Joker" last weekend in the White House's private screening room.
The U.S. president joins the many people worldwide who have flocked to Todd Phillips' dark portrait of a clownish villain - played by Joaquin Phoenix and drawn from Batman lore - who is driven to homicide and mayhem by mental illness, poverty and social scorn.
"Joker" just struck the $1-billion (U.S.) gong for global box office receipts, a rare achievement and the first R-rated movie to do so. Awards speculation is full throttle and a sequel is now planned.
Trump reportedly loved the film, but on what basis? He didn't tweet or otherwise utter a reaction. Was he drawn to the drama of Phoenix's searing performance? Or was he just revelling in a form of poverty porn, munching popcorn as an entitled member of the one per cent minority, as he gawked at the lowest member of the other 99 per cent?
It's a question we could also ask of ourselves. After "Joker" debuted at the Venice Film Festival in August, where it won the fest's Golden Lion for best film, it was followed by mixed reviews that included much critical hand-wringing about how it might inspire copycat killings.
"Does 'Joker' Have a Problematic Punchline?" read a story in trade journal The Hollywood Reporter. There were also reports of theatres beefing up security, fearing a repeat of the 2012 slaughter of Colorado moviegoers by a lone gunman at a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises."
"Joker" opened without incident, and it has left behind its pre-release controversy as it has motored on to make movie history and fatten the bank accounts of director Phillips and studio Warner Bros.
There's still a question about the film's message, however - and it's not the one about copycat gun violence that everybody assumed.
The question is this: Do we really care about the desperate state of the poor and mentally unwell, or do we just like to gawk at them?
Joker poses the question himself, in a bloody scene in the film where he's doing a standup routine on the TV talk show of Murray Franklin, portrayed by Robert De Niro.
"What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a system that abandons him and treats him like trash?" he asks.
"I'll tell you what you get. You get what you f--king deserve!"
Joker is the alter ego of Arthur Fleck, who dons the killer-clown disguise to express his anger at being shunned by society and kicked to the curb by Gotham City, which has just cut funding for the medication and counselling he needs to control his outbursts. The city is in thrall to Thomas Wayne, a Trump-like billionaire running for mayor.
The anti-social theme of "Joker," and also its popular appeal, has been mirrored in another film, Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite," a bleak South Korean class satire which similarly won major film festival laurels before arriving in theatres. It took the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May. It has since taken in $14.5 million at the North American box office, making it the most successful foreign-language Palme winner ever to hit these shores. It's also deemed to be an Oscar contender.
"Parasite" tells the story of an impoverished family, led by a man named Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), whose four members live as grifters in a big city. They conspire to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy family led by tech czar Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), by getting hired on as tutors, a driver and a maid, but their scheme has explosively unforeseen complications.
The disparity between rich and poor is keenly felt, especially in a scene where Mr. Park, unaware that Ki-taek is hiding nearby, wrinkles his nose in disgust at the acrid smell of poverty he's noticed on the rare occasion when he deigns to use the subway.
"For people of different circumstances to live together in the same space is not easy," director Bong says in his notes on the film.
"It is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites?"
Who, indeed? But do we instinctively do this when we rush to see films like "Joker" and "Parasite," eager to watch underclass misery?
I put this question to Kwame McKenzie, the CEO of the Wellesley Institute, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto and director of health equity at the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health. He's an internationally recognized expert on the social causes of illness and suicide and has also advised the Ontario and federal goverments on poverty reduction.
He sees parallels between "Joker" and "Parasite" but also differences.
"In both ways, I think, it is possible to say they are trying to have a deeper understanding of marginalized people and their motivations," McKenzie said via email.
"However, whereas 'Parasite' seems truly transformational - the film seems to normalize the lying and cheating of the protagonists within their sub-cultural context - 'Joker' is in some ways trying to explain why he became a 'bad guy' (with a hint of blaming society)."
McKenzie speculates that we are drawn to watch such films - and also such TV shows as "Mad Men," "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones" and "Mindhunter" - because "we are becoming more fascinated with the psychology of the anti-hero."
"It is possible for me to imagine that people will be interested by revenge fantasy and alter egos that succeed by playing to their own rules because for many life is becoming harder, jobs more precarious, social justice seems difficult to come by and governments peddle a diet of fear to divide us and ease their chances of re-election."
The desperate characters of "Joker" and "Parasite" would surely agree. But should the rest of us, including Donald Trump, just continue to munch our popcorn and enjoy their misery?

The desperate characters of "Joker" and "Parasite" would surely agree. But should the rest of us, including Donald Trump, just continue to munch our popcorn and enjoy their misery?

Donald Trump and his family and friends saw the hit movie " Joker" last weekend in the White House's private screening room.
The U.S. president joins the many people worldwide who have flocked to Todd Phillips' dark portrait of a clownish villain - played by Joaquin Phoenix and drawn from Batman lore - who is driven to homicide and mayhem by mental illness, poverty and social scorn.
"Joker" just struck the $1-billion (U.S.) gong for global box office receipts, a rare achievement and the first "R"-rated movie to do so. Awards speculation is full throttle and a sequel is now planned.
Trump reportedly loved the film, but on what basis? He didn't tweet or otherwise utter a reaction. Was he drawn to the drama of Phoenix's searing performance? Or was he just revelling in a form of poverty porn, munching popcorn as an entitled member of the 1% minority, as he gawked at the lowest member of the other 99%?
It's a question we could also ask of ourselves. After "Joker" debuted at the Venice Film Festival in August, where it won the fest's Golden Lion for best film, it was followed by mixed reviews that included much critical hand-wringing about how it might inspire copycat killings.
"Does 'Joker' Have a Problematic Punchline?" read a story in trade journal The Hollywood Reporter. There were also reports of theatres beefing up security, fearing a repeat of the 2012 slaughter of Colorado moviegoers by a lone gunman at a screening of "The Dark Knight Rises."
"Joker" opened without incident, and it has left behind its pre-release controversy as it has motored on to make movie history and fatten the bank accounts of director Phillips and studio Warner Bros.
There's still a question about the film's message, however - and it's not the one about copycat gun violence that everybody assumed.
The question is this: Do we really care about the desperate state of the poor and mentally unwell, or do we just like to gawk at them?
Joker poses the question himself, in a bloody scene in the film where he's doing a standup routine on the TV talk show of Murray Franklin, played by Robert De Niro.
"What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a system that abandons him and treats him like trash?" he asks.
"I'll tell you what you get. You get what you f--king deserve!"
Joker is the alter ego of Arthur Fleck, who dons the killer-clown disguise to express his anger at being shunned by society and kicked to the curb by Gotham City, which has just cut funding for the medication and counselling he needs to control his outbursts. The city is in thrall to Thomas Wayne, a Trump-like billionaire running for mayor.
The anti-social theme of "Joker," and also its popular appeal, has been mirrored in another film, Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite," a bleak South Korean class satire which similarly won major film-festival laurels before arriving in theatres. It took the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May. It has since taken in $14.5 million (U.S.) at the North American box office, making it the most successful foreign-language Palme winner ever to hit these shores. It's also deemed to be an Oscar contender.
"Parasite" tells the story of an impoverished family, led by a man named Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), whose four members live as grifters in a big city. They conspire to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy family led by tech czar Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun), by getting hired on as tutors, a driver and a maid, but their scheme has explosively unforeseen complications.
The disparity between rich and poor is keenly felt, especially in a scene where Mr. Park, unaware that Ki-taek is hiding nearby, wrinkles his nose in disgust at the acrid smell of poverty he's noticed on the rare occasion when he deigns to use the subway.
"For people of different circumstances to live together in the same space is not easy," director Bong says in his notes on the film.
"It is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites?"
Who, indeed? But do we instinctively do this when we rush to see films like "Joker" and "Parasite," eager to watch underclass misery?
I put this question to Kwame McKenzie, the CEO of the Wellesley Institute, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Toronto and director of health equity at the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health. He's an internationally recognized expert on the social causes of illness and suicide and has also advised the Ontario and federal goverments on poverty reduction.
He sees parallels between "Joker" and "Parasite" but also differences.
"In both ways, I think, it is possible to say they are trying to have a deeper understanding of marginalised people and their motivations," McKenzie said via email.
"However, whereas 'Parasite' seems truly transformational - the film seems to normalise the lying and cheating of the protagonists within their sub-cultural context - 'Joker' is in some ways trying to explain why he became a 'bad guy' (with a hint of blaming society)."
McKenzie speculates that we are drawn to watch such films - and also such TV shows as "Mad Men," "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones" and "Mindhunter" - because "we are becoming more fascinated with the psychology of the anti-hero.
"It is possible for me to imagine that people will be interested by revenge fantasy and alter egos that succeed by playing to their own rules because for many life is becoming harder, jobs more precarious, social justice seems difficult to come by and governments peddle a diet of fear to divide us and ease their chances of re-election."

'Sonic' speeds to $57M debut; 'Parasite' sees big Oscar bump; 'Sonic' speeds to $57M debut; 'Parasite' sees big Oscar bump

NEW YORK - The redesigned "Sonic the Hedgehog" showed plenty of teeth at the box office, speeding to a $57 million debut, according to studio estimates Sunday, while "Parasite" saw one of the largest post-Oscars bumps in years following its best picture win.
Paramount Pictures' "Sonic the Hedgehog" came in well above expectations, especially for a movie that just months ago was a laughing stock. After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, "Sonic" was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul - including fixing Sonic's eerily human teeth.
The makeover worked and audiences responded by making "Sonic the Hedgehog" the weekend's top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation. For Paramount, it's a welcome success following misfires such as "Gemini Man" and "Terminator: Dark Fate." The studio estimates "Sonic" will gross $68 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.
"If you don't listen to your customer, and this goes for any business, then you're going to fail," said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. "We retooled Sonic in a way that was obviously very satisfying for the fans and they were very forgiving. Now that they've seen the movie, they love the movie. It all worked out."
The Sega video game adaptation, directed by Jeff Fowler, drew decent reviews (63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an A CinemaScore from moviegoers. The $87 million production co-stars Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik with Ben Schwartz supplying Sonic's voice.
Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite" had its biggest weekend in its 19th week of release. Neon put "Parasite" into its widest release yet (2,001 theatres) following its historic win at the Oscars. ("Parasite" was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.) And despite the film already being available for weeks on digital platforms and on DVD, its $5.5 million weekend is the largest Oscars bump for a best-picture winner since "Gladiator" in 2001.
Last week's opening of "Birds of Prey" followed up its limp debut by sliding to second with $17.1 million. Following its disappointing opening, some theatres retitled the movie "Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey," instead of "Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)."
It was a busy weekend in theatres, with a handful of other new releases - "The Photograph," "Fantasy Island," "Downhill" - seeking to capitalize on both Valentine's Day on Friday and Presidents Day on Monday.
"Fantasy Island," the Blumhouse horror remake of the '70s TV show, fared the best, collecting $12.4 million in ticket sales despite terrible reviews. Sony Pictures handled the release of the low-budget, PG-13 film, which earned just a 9% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes.
Universal Pictures "The Photograph," a romance starring Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield and produced by Will Packer ("Girls Trip," "Ride Along"), opened with $12.2 million. The film, written and directed by Stella Meghie, cost $15 million to make.
"Downhill," from Disney's Fox Searchlight Pictures, debuted with $4.7 million, a modest start for a film starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell. A remake of the acclaimed Swedish film "Force Majeure" by Ruben Östlund, "Downhill" didn't do great with critics but fared even worse with audiences. They gave it a D CinemaScore.
Neon followed up its "Parasite" Oscar win with the Valentine's Day release of "Portrait of a Lady on Fire," one of 2019's most acclaimed films. Following a one-week qualifying run in December, Celine Sciamma's French period romance opened in 22 theatres with a strong per-theatre average of about $20,000.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
1. "Sonic the Hedgehog," $57 million ($44.3 million international).
2. "Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey," $17.1 million ($23 million international).
3. "Fantasy Island," $12.4 million ($7.6 million international).
4. "The Photograph," $12.3 million.
5. "Bad Boys for Life," $11.3 million ($11.1 million international).
6. "1917," $8.1 million ($6.4 million international).
7. "Jumanji: The Next Level," $5.7 million ($1.9 million international).
8. "Parasite," $5.5 million.
9. "Dolittle," $5.1 million ($8.8 million international).
10. "Downhill," $4.7 million.

Why 'Parasite' Studio CJ Entertainment Is Betting Big on Skydance

Feb 14, 2020( The Wrap: http://www.thewrap.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  On the heels of its historic and celebrated multi-win night at the 92nd Academy Awards, the South Korean powerhouse studio behind 'Parasite' is looking to parlay its best picture win into a bigger spotlight in Hollywood. CJ Entertainment and Merchandising, headed by Miky Lee, along with RedBird Capital Partners, this week announced an investment of $275 million in Skydance Media, the film and TV production vehicle founded by David Ellison. The move not only positions Skydance for foreign expansion, even as it comes off two significant box office flops with 'Terminator: Dark Fate' and 'Gemini Man,' but also extends the reach into Hollywood for CJ Entertainment, which already has a host of english-language films in the pipeline, including a Kevin Hart remake of Korean box office hit 'Extreme Job.'[1] 'Every successful foreign film company wants to plant its flag in Hollywood,' said Sky Moore, a partner at the law firm Greenberg Glusker. 'This is the center of the universe.' 
Lee, who stepped to the microphone on the Dolby stage on Oscar Sunday to uproarious encouragement, is an heiress who took her slice of the family fortune to become the most powerful media mogul in South Korea.Also Read: Skydance Lands $275 Million Investment From 'Parasite' Studio CJ ENM, RedBird Capital[2]CJ Group was founded in the early 1950s by Lee's grandfather, who was also the first chairman at Samsung. The CJ entertainment arm, which Lee oversees, financed not only 'Parasite,' but Bong Joon Ho's other films, 'Snowpiercer,' 'Mother' and 'Memories of Murder.' Lee's Korean conglomerate is not the first foreign company to show interest by dumping a chunk of change in Hollywood. Despite the company's success already, Moore isn't convinced CJ Entertainment will thrive where so many have failed before it. 'Generally, American films play better around the world, but if history be our guide, they're going to have a tough time finding success,' Moore said. 'It's hard, the road is littered with dead bodies fundamentally, the model of you give money to a studio and hope to get money back is a scary proposition.'Also Read: Bill Bost Promoted to President of TV at Skydance[3]Skydance, meanwhile, is looking to tap into overseas markets as growth at the U.S. box office slows. 'There are a lot of reasons to get into the foreign market with content, but the thing is, the U.S. box office is never growing again,' said Ross Gerber, CEO of media investment firm Gerber Kawasaki. The $275 million investment comes as Skydance clears the smoke from a pair of high-profile, big-budget box office bombs for the production house. Such a one-two punch as a succession of bombs followed by new investments in Hollywood typically raises questions about the state of a company, especially for an industry that's eaten so many independent studios alive. Skydance declined to comment for this story, as did representatives for CJ Entertainment. 'We are honored to partner with RedBird Capital and CJ ENM. These are sophisticated strategic partners who believe in our creative vision and our ambitious strategy to build the studio of the future,' Ellison said in a statement 'Their partnership will help propel us to another decade of exponential growth as we look to shape the future of where entertainment is heading.' Gerber said it's a sign that Skydance 'desperately needed the capital,' which shouldn't necessarily be a knock against Skydance. Part of the cost of doing business when you own and operate an independent studio in Hollywood is constantly needing to raise money to fuel and grow the company.Also Read: David Goyer Signs Overall Deal With Skydance Television[4]'I'm sure these investors aren't stupid. You're not there to just bail out the studio,' Moore argued. 'I work on these deals all the time. They're likely going to cabin off past losses and make sure the money is used for future growth.'Also Read: Skydance Animation's Production Head Holly Edwards Promoted to President[5]Last year, Skydance suffered two of its biggest box office let downs in 'Terminator: Dark Fate' and 'Gemini Man.' Both were done in conjunction with Paramount. Ellison's company also co-produced Netflix's '6 Underground' with Michael Bay's production company. While 'Terminator: Genisys' garnered a solid international draw, reviews and domestic box office suggest that Skydance and Paramount haven't quite been able to pull-off a Terminator reboot. The box office for 'Dark Fate,' however, was especially poor. The film grossed $261.1 million worldwide, on a production budget of $185 million — that's before prints and advertising. 'Dark Fate' ended up posting a loss of more than $70 million. 'Gemini Man' fared worse, pulling in $173.5 million on a $138 million budget. Skydance doesn't distribute the films itself, and instead partners with of Paramount, Tencent, and now CJ Entertainment in order to mitigate risk and soften the blow of box office under performers.Also Read: 'Oklahoma!' TV Adaptation Set at Skydance in Deal With Rodgers ...mmerstein[6]Skydance also doesn't own the properties it helps produce. Without knowing the nitty gritty of the deals the studio does for films with Paramount, in this town, the power resides with the distributor. 'I don't think the revenue streams of renting out the catalog is enough to offset the costs,' Gerber said. The son of tech billionaire Larry Ellison — the co-founder and current chief technology officer of software company Oracle — David Ellison founded Skydance in 2006. The studio had a tepid beginning, releasing 'Flyboys' in 2006 starring James Franco, as well as Ellison, until landing a production partnership with Paramount Pictures. With Paramount Pictures in its corner, Skydance was able to get its hands on brands such as 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Star Trek' and 'Terminator.' Not to mention, the backing of a major studio, plus Ellison's father, helped Skydance raise $350 million in equity to get the ball rolling.Also Read: Vine Alternative Investment Acquires Lakeshore Entertainment Library, International Sales[7]From then on, Skydance began focusing on event-level blockbusters for global audiences. Since 2010, Skydance has co-produced upwards of 20 films, including box office gold, such as 'Mission: Impossible — Fallout.' The big boon for Skydance, more than the gravitational pull that big Hollywood films bring, is the studio's TV division, which was launched in 2013 and continues to be a growth arm for the production company. Skydance produces some of streaming's most popular shows in Netflix's 'Grace and Frankie,' as well as 'Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan' and 'Jack Reacher' on Amazon. As more streamers come on line — Apple TV+, Peacock and HBO Max — Skydance seems to be all-in on the prospects of more TV opportunities, especially with streaming's ability to reach global audiences. In a lot of ways, however, the same problem exists as with its film projects, Skydance doesn't own its shows.Also Read: STX Entertainment Seeks Saudi Arabia Investment as Indie Studio Struggles[8]That aside, a $275 million injection of cash and a partnership with one of Asia's premier film and TV producers is a big get. Moore told it to TheWrap best: 'More money is always a good thing.' And this level of commitment from CJ Entertainment coming off of its monumental, possibly game changing win at the Oscars, might say a lot about the future of foreign films and investment in the U.S. as well as Hollywood productions around the world. Or it's possible CJ and Skydance benefit for a few years before CJ Entertainment retreats back to South Korea and David Ellison is out raising more capital to fuel the company and its growth. 'There's a lot of things in Hollywood that don't make economic sense,' Gerber said. 'Hollywood has always worked because of the glamour and glitz, and people buy into that stuff.' Only time will tell.Related stories from TheWrap: 'Parasite' Director's Korean American Interpreter Wants to Make Her Own Movie - About the Oscar Season[9]Inside the Oscars, 'Parasite' Points an Elated Hollywood Forward[10]Oscars 2020: South Korea Jubilant After Historic 'Parasite' Win[11] [ 1]: https://www.thewrap.com/kevin-hart-to-remake-extreme-job-universal/ [ 2]:            https://www.thewrap.com/skydance-lands-275-million-investment-from-parasite-studio-cj-entertainment-redbird-capital/ [ 3]:            https://www.thewrap.com/bill-bost-promoted-to-president-of-tv-at-skydance/ [ 4]:            https://www.thewrap.com/david-goyer-tv-deal-skydance-television/ [ 5]:            https://www.thewrap.com/skydance-animation-production-head-holly-edwards-promoted-to-president/ [ 6]:            https://www.thewrap.com/oklahoma-tv-adaptation-set-at-skydance-in-deal-with-rodgers-hammerstein/ [ 7]:            https://www.thewrap.com/village-roadshow-vine-alternative-investment-acquisition-lakeshore-entertainment/ [ 8]:            https://www.thewrap.com/stx-entertainment-seeks-saudi-arabia-investment-as-indie-studio-struggles/ [ 9]:            https://www.thewrap.com/bong-joon-ho-interpreter-sharon-choi-awards-season-film/ [ 10]:            https://www.thewrap.com/inside-the-oscars-parasite-points-an-elated-hollywood-forward/ [ 11]:            https://www.thewrap.com/oscars-2020-south-korea-celebrates-historic-parasite-win/

"Parasite" made history at the Oscars: it won four awards including best film

South Korean Parasite Bong Joon-Ho made history: it became the first non-English-spoken film to win the Oscars jackpot. In addition, she was the one with the most statuettes from last night's ceremony in Los Angeles: she also became the best director, best original screenplay and international film. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which delivers the Oscar, had never recognized a South Korean film.
Parasite thus set aside those who came as the big favorites in a group that featured 11 nominations and 1917 that had 10 nominations and all the way to sweep the awards.
Guasón took the obvious Best Actor award for Joaquin Phoenix and best original music (which for the first time was won by a woman, the Icelandic Hildur Gusnadóttir).  1917 by Sam Mendes also took home the categories he had the safest: better photography (Roger Deakins, for the second year in a row), visual effects and sound mixing.
Once in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino's last to come up with aspirations in 10 categories, he realized two: best production design and best supporting actor for a Brad Pitt who, upon receiving him, was friendly but much more sober than in the Globes of Gold.
More forceful was the defeat of the other film that came with 10 nominations.  The Irishman, the last of Martin Scorsese, took nothing and that meant leaving his director, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino empty, for example. Despite this, Scorsese was given a standing ovation when Bong Joon-Ho dedicated the award to him and mentioned it as one of his main influences.
Irish is a Netflix production. The platform came to the party with 24 nominations and left with only two: Laura Dern for Best Supporting Actress for Marriage Story and the documentary American Factory, the platform's first association with Barack and Michelle Obama's production company.
He also won two awards in technical areas (editing and editing sound), Against the impossible that he aspired to best film.
As best lead actress, she won Renee Zellweger for her judy Garland's composition. It's her second Oscar, making her one of the most awarded actresses of her generation.
The Academy clearly preferred for the leading the most histrionic performances, over the subtleties of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver in Marriage Story or Antonio Banderas in Pain and Glory.
Taika Waititi won best adapted screenplay by Jojo Rabbit and Women's Best Costume Design, a fair but insufficient recognition for one of the best films of the year.  Toy Story 4 was the best animated film, beating FavoriteMissing Link and Spanish, Klaus.
The best song of the year was for Elton John and Bernie Taupin for "[I’m Gonna) Love Me Again", Rocketman's song, John's biopic.
Parasite became the first film in 65 years to win the two great recognitions of world cinema: the Palme d'Or in Cannes and the Oscar for best film. The only time that had happened was in 1955 with Marty, a drama with Ernest Borgnine, of which few memories remain.
Bong's film tells the story of two South Korean families: the Kims are very rich and the Parks are delicious. However, by a series of circumstances they cross paths and show an impassable social rift. It is a reflection on the inequities that South Korean prosperity has left, but its hypothesis is universal. It is a great film that in Uruguay was presented at the José Ignacio International Film Festival (where it won the jackpot) and is still on the lineup in Montevideo.
Bong matched Walt Disney's record of being the person to take four awards inone night. Last year, Alfonso Cuarón for Rome was made of three.
The ceremony lasted three and a half hours and showed, as always, the best of American cinema. He had no designated driver and appealed to the grace of some of the award anchors to keep interest. It wasn't as boring as other years.
The list of hosts included Salma Hayek, Oscar Isaac, Will Ferrell, Steve Martin, Chris Rock, Sigourney Weaver, Brie Larson, Gal Gadot, Steven Spielberg, Maya Rudolph, Kristen Wiig, James Corden and Rebel Wilson draped in Cats costumes and mocking that and Diane Keaton and Keanu Reeves, the most charming couple in the world. Tom Hanks presented the opening Academy Museum and Jane Fonda presented the award for Best Picture.
There were a lot of musical numbers. In addition to all the nominated songs and a review of the best from some films, he acted, resirantly, Eminem. And Billie Eilish, the girl of the moment, performed, with her brother at the piano, a surrender from "Yesterday" that accompanied the emotional segment of the deceased film world.
Despite what usually happens, the ceremony was not marked by politics. Although there were female claims and a confused allegation from Phoenix about animal rights and climate change, no one referred to the convulsed local politics.
It was, in short, a movie night. And for those who say they're predictable prizes, this year the Oscars were sent with an unexpected prize. Fair, certainly, but unexpected.>

'Parasite' deserves all the recognition it got

"Parasite" deserves all the recognition it got.
We don't always agree with the Oscar nominations and winners, over the last couple of years, we've actually been somewhat disappointed by their decisions.
Whether it's a film that never got nominated we feel as if should've gotten recognition, such as "Waves" by Trey Edward Shults, or a film we feel as if shouldn't have won, such as "Bohemian Rhapsody" winning Best Editing, sometimes the Oscars leaves us wanting more.
However, one thing that we will never do is crawl to Twitter to vehemently attack other people's opinions - If you enjoy a film, you should be allowed to do so openly without people belittling your views.
Unfortunately, This seems to be the case all over Twitter and Youtube when it comes to Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite," which got the Oscars' for Best Foreign Language film, Best Original Screenplay, and the main topic of debate - Best Picture.
Parasite is an excellent film - We are aware that if the movie didn't get as much attention with American audiences as it did, the Academy would have likely ignored it for Best Picture. But the proof is in the pudding, and it did extremely well in the American box office for a foreign film, grossing at $35 million.
Boon Jong Ho got recognized at the Cannes International Film Festival with the Palme d'Or, a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language film, and won best international independent film at the British independent film awards. It's even getting added to the Criterion Collection, which for many directors, is a dream come true.
So then why is Bong Joon Ho facing so much resistance for winning Best Picture at the Oscars.
Similar to how they ruin anything they touch, one huge problem emerging from Twitter are blatant racists. If you don't want to read, sure, but it crosses the line of criticism when you legitimately say it's less of a film if it's in a different language.
One viral tweet via @Millerstream writes "A man named Bong Joon Ho wins #Oscar for best original screenplay over Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917. Acceptance speech was: 'GREAT HONOR. THANK YOU.' Then he proceeds to give the rest of his speech in Korean.
These people are the destruction of America."
While he continued to backpedal after making that tweet, it created an outlet for many other racist comments to be circulated through the web via comments. We genuinely don't understand why these people even watch the Oscars, as film is becoming more progressive every single day.
Another reason people are unhappy with "Parasite" is the fact that it won both Best Foreign Language film and Best Picture. Some believe that if it's the best foreign film, it should be immediately disqualified from being nominated for best picture. While it's true that a foreign film has never won Best Picture, this is something that happens almost every year with other categories.
Take Peter Farrelly's "Green Book" for example, on top of winning Best Picture it also received the Oscars' for Best Screenplay and Best supporting actor.
Why should some films be restricted to certain accolades while others aren't?
Film, like many other art forms, can be enjoyed universally. Even without subtitles, one can appreciate certain elements in film such as cinematography, the actors' physical acting, soundtracks and editing.
If you genuinely didn't enjoy the writing from Boon Jong Ho, or the acting from Kang-ho Song, or any other element of the film, it's absolutely fine to be dissapointed with it winning Best Picture. We wanted "The Lighthouse" to be nominated for Best Picture, and were surprised to see it only got nominated for Best Cinematography.
Admittedly, we were a bit upset by this - But we would never verbally attack someone for disagreeing with what we believe. If you like something that we reviewed as not particularly great, that doesn't mean we think you're wrong, we simply have different tastes.
Anyways, we couldn't be happier that "Parasite" won, and it's temporarily being brought back to theaters if you didn't catch the chance to watch it.

"Parasite" is a very complex movie, from beginning to end. It's a film that is definitely worth repeating because it'll keep you on your toes and make you think. My overall rating of the film is a 5 out of 5. I was caught off guard at first with it being a foreign film and questioning its premise, but that question didn't matter by the end of the film.
Directed by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho, the film was first released last year in South Korea on May 30, and then in the U.S. on Oct. 5.
"Parasite" is about the Kim family, who are poor and live in a small basement apartment with dreams to become rich someday. When the opportunity to get more money arises, the family devises a plan to pose as the wealthy Park family. The film touches on the idea of socio-economic classes, and how it affects the Kim family.
The film meets the criteria of being a good movie with an amazing director, great actors/actresses, and a terrific screenplay. Throughout the movie I was confused, laughing, and on the edge of my seat as I watched what became an innocent action turn into something more unexpected.
Besides the actors giving great performances in the film, I think that the production crew also did a phenomenal job. Production designer Ha-jun Lee made sure that the environment and the buildings told a story. Costume designer Se-yeon Choi demonstrated that you can tell a story with subtle things, like the clothes you wear. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong made sure that the shots and angles were set up to give the characters and settings were the main spotlight.
The film has 6 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Director. It has also received widespread critical acclaim, earning an 8.6/10 on IMDb, 96% on Metacritic, and a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. I highly recommend seeing "Parasite."

Five reasons why Parasite won at the Oscars
The Week

         The 2020 Oscars last night delivered the biggest surprise yet of this awards season, with South Korean film Parasite becoming the first non-English movie ever to win Best Picture.
  Bong Joon-ho's darkly satirical thriller also saw off competition from some of Hollywood's most seasoned filmmakers to pick up Best Director, Best International Feature Film and Best Original Screenplay.
So what was it that won over the Academy?
A pitch-perfect theme
Parasite "doesn't just have something to say, but it says it artfully", says Vox's Alissa Wilkinson. 
The film follows the Kims, a poor family who scheme their way into the employment of a wealthy household and infiltrate their home.
Wilkinson argues that this "deserving" Best Picture winner taps into a prevailing theme in world cinema in 2019: "that rampant inequality all over the world was building to some kind of inevitable breaking point".
Yet "Parasite makes humans of everyone in its story", she adds. "Nobody's a caricature. Nobody's even really a villain. Instead, the system in which they live is the villain."
A top acting ensemble
As The Washington Post noted last week, while Parasite was up for six Oscar nominations in total, none of its actors received individual Academy nods, reflecting a history of under-representation of Asians in Hollywood.
However, Parasite's status as an Oscars front runner was "thanks in no small part" to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) ensemble award that the cast bagged last month, says the newspaper.
The Post predicted, correctly, that "although the actors won't be able to collect individual trophies on Sunday, their work could still prove crucial in helping make Oscars history".
The Bong charm
Director Bong has long had a loyal following in the US, says Glenn Whipp in the Los Angeles Times. 
"But with Parasite, he also demonstrated a tireless energy during the long awards season, charming voters with his authentic, gracious spirit, his humor and the way he celebrated his cast's ensemble win at the SAG Awards, filming them like a proud dad," says the entertainment reporter.
The awards season momentum for Parasite "had been building for months" as adoration for Bong and his film "played out at event after event", Whipp adds.
The Roma backlash
Whipp also suggests that the attention Roma received in 2019 "paved the way for Parasite to triumph this year".
Alfonso Cuaron's Netflix film earned Mexico its first ever win in the Best Foreign Language Film category last year, but missed out on Best Film and Best Director, to the disappointment of many critics.
During his acceptance speech, Cuaron joked that he "grew up watching foreign-language movies... like Citizen Kane, Jaws, Rashomon, The Godfather, Breathless". According to The Atlantic's Hannah Giorgis, the barb contributed to the Academy's decision to change the category's name to Best International Film in time for the 2020 awards.
Giorgis adds: "Last night, Parasite built on Cuaron's challenge to the Academy. In taking home the Best International Film trophy and also claiming the biggest honor of the night, Bong's movie made the Oscars slightly less local."

A bold new direction for the Academy?
LA Times film critic Justin Chang suggested in January that the Oscars needed Parasite more than Parasite needed the Oscars.
He doubted that the Academy membership would "ever acknowledge that cinema is and always has been a global medium, that no national cinema has a monopoly on greatness and that the best film every year is not always - perhaps not even usually - an American one".
Accepting the Golden Globe for Foreign Language Film last month, Bong also playfully pointed out some of the circuit's blind spots: "Once you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."
Against expectations, on Sunday the Academy "hopped over that barrier, catching up with audiences who have long shown that it isn't too high a hurdle", says Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian.
He concludes: "All of the worries about the Academy Awards and awards ceremonies still persist. It is a conceited white boys' club. But the triumph of Parasite has done a lot to counteract this: a portent of change."

Parasite review - satire and soul in Seoul; The year's surprise Oscar contender is a South Korean film that leaves Ed Potton dazzled

****☆
It's another hit from the Bong. 
Bong Joon-ho
, the South Korean writer-director who brought us 
                   Okja                    
and 
                   Snowpiercer                   
, returns with a hilarious, strange, angry and wildly imaginative concoction that has been nominated for six Oscars and has won two Baftas and the Palme d'Or at Cannes. A high-risk Korean-language fusion of farce, satire and horror, it centres on a family of four: Ki-taek (
Song Kang-ho
), his wife, Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin), their twentysomething son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and their daughter, Ki-jung (Park So-dam).
They make a sorry quartet, crammed into a tiny basement flat where they earn tiny sums from folding pizza boxes, watch drunks pee against their window and scrounge free wifi from neighbouring cafés - Ki-jung crouches beside the toilet to get a signal and they open cans of beer to "toast their reconnection".
Yet their good-humoured squabbling conceals a streak of creative opportunism that surfaces when a friend of Ki-woo's offers him the chance to take over his job tutoring the daughter of a wealthy businessman. He and his family live in a vast modernist house in Seoul that couldn't be any more different from Ki-woo and co's dismal digs. It's an extraordinary space, all clean lines of glass and stone, that almost becomes a character in the film.
Ki-woo's sister forges him a university diploma and he wastes no time inveigling his way into the affections of the girl and her mother (the excellent Cho Yeo-jeong), who is as trusting as she is generous with her husband's money. "She's rich, but she's still nice," Ki-taek says. "She's nice because she's rich," Chung-sook says. It's one of several stinging lines in a story that was partly inspired by Bong's experience working as a tutor for a rich family.
Ki-woo's relatives are soon assuming aliases to get on the payroll of their oblivious benefactors as chauffeur, housekeeper and art teacher to their disturbed young son. The deceptions become increasingly Byzantine - the scenes in which they practise their lines are a hoot, as is Chung-sook's impression of North Korean news announcers.
What's already an entertaining yarn - a heist movie crossed with a domestic farce - is then sent spinning off in a new direction by a totally unexpected twist. The film veers between comedy, social critique and much darker fare with the woozy confidence of an intoxicated person walking along a window ledge. Whatever Bong puts in his bong must be darn strong.
Such daring means the screenplay creaks ever so slightly in places. Yet although you expect the whole enterprise to come crashing down around Bong's ears, it never does. This is a film-maker working with delightful confidence and moral conviction.

‘1917’ and ‘Parasite’ Are Big Winners at the BAFTAs

But the lack of diversity in the nominees dominated the award ceremony, with Joaquin Phoenix calling out “systemic racism” in the movie business.
LONDON — “1917,” Sam Mendes’s visually extravagant World War I drama that takes viewers into the chaos of the trenches was the big winner at the EE British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, taking seven awards including best film.
Mendes was also named best director at the event, better known as the BAFTAs, Britain’s equivalent of the Oscars.
The haul adds to the movie’s wins for best drama and best director at the Golden Globes and will increase hype around the movie in the run-up to the Oscars.
“In the midst of all this hoopla, it’s sometimes easy to forget the actual experience of shooting a movie,” Mendes said, accepting his best director award. “I had a kind of director’s paradise in this film that I think I’ll never, ever have again.”
The sweep for “1917” came despite the film receiving mixed reviews in Britain. Kevin Maher,            writing in The Times of London, called it “two hours of amphetamine-rush cinema” and “instantly, an Oscar-night front-runner.”
But some were more dismissive. Robbie Collin, writing in The Daily Telegraph, called it “emotionally inert.”
“I can’t recall the last time I was so staggered by a film’s technique while feeling almost nothing else about it at all,” he wrote.
Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” — a thriller about a poor family who insinuate themselves into the lives of a pampered household, and the            first Korean film to be nominated for the best picture Oscar — was the night’s other big winner, taking the awards for best film not in the English language and best original screenplay.
Bong, accepting the screenplay prize, said he used to write in coffee shops. “I never imagined I’d be standing here at the Royal Albert Hall,” he added, clearly overjoyed.
“Joker,” the movie based on the comic book character, had been tipped to win big at the awards, after it            secured 11 nominations in January, the most for any film. In the end, it won only three, with Joaquin Phoenix as best actor for the title role being the biggest.
The run-up to the BAFTAs was dominated by complaints about the lack of diversity among the nominees. No person of color was nominated in the best acting categories, and no woman was shortlisted for best director.
Such complaints have also hit this year’s Golden Globes and            Academy Awards, but in the case of the BAFTAs, even Amanda Berry, chief executive of the body that organizes the awards, said she was “very disappointed” by the situation. The body had “hoped we’d see at least one female director,” she            told the BBC in January.
The British Academy of Film and Television Arts quickly announced a full and thorough review of its voting procedures, but that did not stop the criticism. Steve McQueen, the British director of “12 Years a Slave” and “Widows,” told The Guardian the awards risked becoming “irrelevant, redundant and of no interest or importance” without change.
The issue wasn’t missing from the award ceremony itself. Joaquin Phoenix said he felt “conflicted” when he accepted the best actor award for “Joker.”
“I think that we send a very clear message to people of color that you’re not welcome here,” he said. “That’s the message we send.”
Phoenix also called out “systemic racism” in the film industry. “It is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression to be the ones that dismantle it,” Phoenix said. “That’s on us.”
Prince William, the president of BAFTA, referred to it, too, when introducing the event’s final award. “In 2020 and not for the first time in the last few years, we find ourselves talking again about the need to do more to ensure diversity in the sector and in the awards process,” he said. “That simply cannot be right in this day and age,” he added.
Other major winners at the BAFTAs included Renée Zellweger, who won best actress for her portrayal of Judy Garland at the end of her life in “Judy”; Laura Dern, who won best supporting actress for “           Marriage Story”; and Brad Pitt, who won best supporting actor for “           Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood” — all three repeating their successes from the Golden Globes.
Pitt missed the event, but his acceptance speech — which included a reference to Britain’s exit from the European Union on Friday — got one of the evening’s biggest laughs. “Hey Britain, heard you just became single,” he said in a speech, read out by the actress Margot Robbie. “Welcome to the club.”
“The Irishman,” Martin Scorsese’s latest epic, failed to win any awards.
The BAFTAs are widely viewed as a bellwether for the Academy Awards, because there is some overlap between the 6,500-strong membership of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, which organizes the BAFTAs, and the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
This year the two ceremonies are just a week apart, with the Oscars on Feb. 9.

There has only been a handful of non-English language films to ever get a Best Picture nomination
FOR SOME YEARS now, hallyu or the so-called Korean wave consisting of a wide variety of cultural products from melodramatic TV soaps and K-Pop to some very good films, have been lapping up on foreign shores and becoming something of an international obsession. A book-Han Kang's bestselling The Vegetarian which won the 2016 Man Booker International Prize-had made for an unusual hallyu product. We now have a film, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, that's has just booked a seat at the ultimate cultural high table, the Academy Awards.

Like Alfonso Cuaron's Roma last year, this dark comic film has broken out of the Award's Best Foreign Language Film box and picked up a slew of Oscar nominations, from that for directing, original screenplay, editing, production design, international feature categories to the prized Best Picture category. It ideally should have picked up acting nods too.

There has only been a handful of non-English language films to ever get a Best Picture nomination, and, except for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, none from Asia. By the buzz Parasite began generating all of last year, it certainly has a shot. Parasite was a crowd favourite at the Cannes last year (it picked up the Palme d'Or at Cannes, the first South Korean film to do so). Since then, it's generated fawning reviews everywhere, won best foreign film at the Golden Globes a few weeks ago; and has won or been nominated for a slew of other awards.

And it has done what international arthouse phenomena rarely do, one even Roma couldn't manage-become genuinely popular with the crowds. As AO Scott of The New York Times (NYT) wrote in his review of the film, it is 'the kind of smart, generous, aesthetically-energized movie that obliterates the tired distinctions between art films and popcorn movies.' It is already this year's theatrically most watched foreign film in the US. According to NYT, it has earned over $US25 million. In comparison, South Korea's last year's entry for best foreign picture, Lee Chang-dong's Burning, again another very good film, an adaptation of a Murakami story, which in turn was inspired by a Faulkner story, made only $719,000. Parasite is still some way away from the all-time record of Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ($128m) or Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful ($57m), but who can say how it will eventually fare once the Oscar buzz picks up.

If the ultra-violent Oldboy (after picking up the silver ware at the 2004 Cannes) first opened up international audiences towards Korean cinema, Parasite might cement that industry's reputation. The film is essentially a genre-hopping upstairs-downstairs movie about class differences. It is in reality a bitter and pessimistic film but it is so encased in humour that it is difficult to realise the pill one is swallowing. You may root for the underdog, but like in real life, the underdog is not going to make it.

The film focuses on two families-the Kims, who live in a squalid house below ground level, and the Parks, who live elsewhere, in a luxurious house, but one (minor spoiler alert) which contains a secret basement. The Kims live by performing what we may call jugaad in India. They fold pizza boxes for a living, use their neighbour's Wi-Fi, and when the road above their house is fumigated, open the windows so their house's mosquitoes are exterminated. One by one, by forging documents and creating new identities, the Kims infiltrate the Parks' household by becoming their servants. The son, Ki-woo, becomes a tutor to the daughter in the Park household. He in turn gets his sister to pose as an art tutor; the two then scheme together to get their father to replace the Parks' driver; and finally, all three of them come together to plot the removal of the maid and get her replaced by the final member of the Kim family. The Parks are what we may recognise as the nice liberal elite, the types who are conscious of their privilege and speak respectfully to their help. But, the film will show, this is of course a mask, one perhaps their wearers don't even know they wear. Wealth can afford luxuries, even of becoming nice. One of the characters will say in the film, Mrs Park is 'nice because she's rich'.

The Kims are the parasites. But in some moments, even the Parks appear to be so. In one scene, the Park couple arouse themselves by talking about drugs and cheap knickers used by the poor, as though they can only sexualise their lives by invoking elements of the working class. In the middle of the act, Mrs Park strangely whispers to her husband, 'Buy me drugs.'
The term han-said to encompass a wide array of feelings such as anger, revenge, grief, suffering, resignation, longing and pain-became popular in the 1970s, as Koreans advocated for a kind of cultural authenticity, but its origins are older, from the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century

South Korean movies-and the book The Vegetarian-tend to have an aesthetic that is very distinct from Western films. Their best films are more contemplative, often slower paced, and at their hearts, they carry tender stories of love between partners or within families, themes that should be more easily identifiable to Indians. But they almost always contain a strong unrecognisable undercurrent of rage. A languid story moving peacefully will inexplicably explode into an orgy of violence. People will be hacked, decapitated, disembowelled, or hammered to death. In The Vegetarian, as simple a decision as that of abstaining from meat, will upend a character and her family's lives, leading to rage and violence. For all the mirth and pleasantness of its earlier parts, Parasite also ends in violence. For a culture so steeped in values such as obedience, respect and good manners, these films are particularly shocking.

The Korean word han is often used to describe the type of rage portrayed in these films and books. A review of The Vegetarian in The New York Review of Books (NYRB) quotes the Korean author Euny Hong (in The Birth of Korean Cool: How One Nation Is Conquering the World Through Pop Culture) to describe the word as 'a culturally specific ultra-distilled form of rage' arising 'from the fact that the universe can never pay off this debt [of unfair treatment of Koreans], not ever.' The term (said to encompass a wide array of feelings such as anger, revenge, grief, suffering, resignation, longing and pain) became popular in the 1970s, as Koreans advocated for a kind of cultural authenticity, but its origins are older, from the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century. The NYRB article says, 'Han is a sort of unique Korean national trait or spiritual condition-a characteristic rage against other people, enemies of the nation, or even history itself.'

But where does this rage come from? An NYT article which explores this idea of rage in Korean cinema-and finds its spread even across Japan and China-suggests that it might have something to do with the Confucian philosophy and its fundamental beliefs about obedience and respect and how these have been manipulated to create a highly unequal society. In Parasite, the arrival of an ornamental rock (supposed to be venerated in Confucianism) brings luck into the Kim family. Yet, the same rock later becomes a tool of violence. 'Rage is a destructive emotion but within art, it is also radical and, in rare moments, elucidating,' the article reads. 'The best of these films understand that the outcome of pitting people against one another can be violent, that it will invariably end badly. But they also understand that a repressive society can transform individuals into monsters.'

Last year, Roma came close to doing what no non-English-language film had done before. It entered the ceremony as the odds-on favourite, it made history by taking best director, but tripped up at the final hurdle of Best Picture. The cast and crew of Parasite, the millions who loved watching it and an entire generation of filmmakers across the world will be rooting for a different outcome this time.

Korea, Asia Rejoice in 'Parasite' Oscar Wins
Variety

After weeks of awards campaigning and hundreds of interviews, "Parasite" began Sunday as a successful and well-appreciated movie. Yet its Academy Awards wins for best picture and for            Bong Joon-ho as best director were shocks that thrilled the Asian movie industry.
"I'm so happy for all the Asian Film industry. It has now created bigger dreams for Asian filmmakers," said Jonathan Kim, Korean producer. "Now I have a different view on Hollywood. Even Hollywood is becoming more open minded."
"Game changer!!! So happy for all of us. The Asians have finally arrived in Hollywood!" said Andrew Ooi, president of Echelon Talent Management, a Vancouver-based management firm with a predominantly Asian clientele.
For many in Asia, the award was a well-deserved prize for a brilliant and imaginative director who had been known regionally, but not on a world stage, perhaps for a pesky technical problem.
"The Oscar win by 'Parasite' is as stunning as it is historic. It is a tremendous achievement for both Bong Joon Ho and Korean cinema as a whole. But its biggest contribution going forward may be to break apart many viewers' preconceived notions about the so-called 'limitations' of subtitled films," said Darcy Paquet, Korean cinema historian, former Variety correspondent, and author of the film's sub-titles.
No subtitled film has won the Oscar's best picture award in nearly a century.
That point was underlined by Thai film critic Kong Rithdee, who echoed Bong's Golden Globes acceptance speech, in which the director referred to "the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles." Rithdee said that Hollywood elites "gasped with embarrassment and sudden realization" when they understood that Bong was pointing his finger at them.
For some commentators, this was a case of individual brilliance. "There are few directors in the world who receive prizes at film festivals and cater to commercial tastes," film critic Jeon Chan-il told Korean news agency Yonhap. "Bong's definitely become one of the top filmmakers in the world."
"This is surely the best possible combination - best film, best director, best original screenplay - that any movie can possible earn," said Winnie Lau, producer at Ivanhoe Pictures.
For many others, the four Oscar haul is a justification, and necessary catch-up for, the wider South Korean film industry. Korean filmmakers, including Bong, Park Chan-wook, Kim Jee-woon, Lee Chang-dong, and Hong Sang-soo, have led the way in Asia and on global the festival stage for two decades, but the country had not previously received even a single Oscars nomination.
"We never write to represent our countries. But this is very first Oscar to South Korea," said Bong on stage after receiving the award for best original screenplay. "As there is Hollywood in the U.S., in            Korea we have Chungmuro (the old heartland of Korean cinema). I'd like to share this honor with all the storytellers and filmmakers at Chungmuro."
Coincidentally, the Seoul Metropolitan Council, announced that it had begun construction work on a cinematheque, museum and archive complex that will open in Chungmuro in 2022.
Still others said that the "Parasite" wins were a victory for diversity. "In this year of all years, with Trump, and racism still so prevalent, this a such a vindication," said Maria Chan, producer.
" 'Parasite' made history - won best original screenplay, best international feature film, best director and best picture in 2020 Academy Awards. Congratulations!," said the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) in a Twitter message.
"Guess the #Oscars aren't so "local" anymore. Warmest, deepest congratulations to #Parasite, the first film not in the English language to ever win Best Picture," said U.S.-based Korean actor and producer, Daniel Dae Kim.

South Korean black comedy "Parasite" made movie history at the Oscars on Sunday, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the best picture award -- Hollywood's biggest prize of all.
A genre-defying thriller about a poor family infiltrating a wealthy household, "Parasite" won four awards, stunning the pundits who believed the Academy would never crown a subtitled Asian movie.
"It's such a great honor. I feel like I'll wake up to find it's all a dream. It all feels very surreal," a jubilant Bong told journalists backstage, calling the night "crazy."
"Parasite" also won the Oscar for best international feature, and became the first Asian film to scoop best original screenplay.
"I thought I was done for the day and ready to relax," Bong had said upon winning best director honours, before promising to "drink until next morning."
Bong also paid tribute on stage to his childhood hero and fellow nominee Martin Scorsese, drawing a standing ovation for the veteran director of "The Irishman" -- which went home empty-handed.
BIGGER SHOCK
But a bigger shock was in store as the movie beat frontrunner "1917" to win best picture, the night's final prize.
"It feels like a very opportune moment in history is happening right now," producer Kwak Sin-ae told an audience of Tinseltown A-listers, who cheered the film's wins throughout the night at the Dolby Theatre.
Bong predicted that "naturally we will come to a day" when "a foreign language film winning this won't be much of an issue."
The pre-Oscars favourite "1917," Sam Mendes's innovative and personal World War I movie about two soldiers crossing no-man's-land, had to settle for best cinematography, visual effects and sound mixing prizes.
The movie -- filmed to appear like one continuous shot -- had swept up trophies at several other galas in the build-up to Sunday.
Joaquin Phoenix won his first Oscar for his turn in supervillain origin story "Joker," the film that started the night with the most nominations.
In an emotionally charged speech, the actor railed against injustice and "an egocentric worldview" that leads to environmental destruction, before paying tribute to his actor brother River, who died of a drug overdose in 1993.
Renee Zellweger sealed a remarkable comeback by winning best actress for "Judy," dedicating the award to the Hollywood screen legend she portrayed.
"Judy Garland did not receive this honour in her time. I am certain that this moment is an extension of the celebration of her legacy," she said in accepting her second Oscar.
Pitt, who claimed his first acting Academy Award for his supporting turn in Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," was one of several winners to strike a political note.
"They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week," he said, referring to President Donald Trump's recent impeachment trial.
"American Factory" -- the first film from Barack and Michelle Obama's production house, about a Rust Belt factory reopened by a Chinese billionaire -- won best documentary.
Best adapted screenplay went to Nazi satire "Jojo Rabbit," about a young boy corrupted by fascism.
Taika Waititi, who is of Maori origin, said he hoped the win would inspire "all the indigenous kids in the world who want to do art and dance and write stories."
Laura Dern won best supporting actress for her turn as a feisty divorce lawyer in "Marriage Story."
The event's luxury and glamour contrasted with the grief in Los Angeles over the recent deaths of Golden Age film legend Kirk Douglas and Oscar-winning basketball star Kobe Bryant.
Record Grammy-winning singer Billie Eilish sang a moving version of "Yesterday" to accompany the "in memoriam" montage for those Hollywood lost this year, which opened with Bryant and closed with Douglas.
Music was a prominent theme throughout the night, which began with a medley addressing a swirling row over the lack of minorities and female directors on the star-studded nominee list.
"We celebrate all the women who directed phenomenal films and I'm so proud to stand here as a black, queer artist," singer Janelle Monae said.
Elton John won for best original song from "Rocketman," a film about his life.
Rapper Eminem, who won an Oscar in 2003, made a surprise appearance on stage to perform his winning song "Lose Yourself" -- which was heavily bleeped out by censors.
Icelandic composer Hildur Gudnadottir won best original score for her haunting music for "Joker."
"To the girls, to the women, to the mothers, to the daughters, who hear the music bubbling within, please speak up," she said. "We need to hear your voices."
No female directors were nominated this year -- a theme referred to by several celebrities.
Natalie Portman, a best actress Oscar winner in 2011 for "Black Swan," literally wore her feelings -- she had their names stitched into the Dior cape she wore to the gala.
The ceremony had no host for a second consecutive time. Early reviews were not favorable.
"When the ads are the real stars, you really have a really serious problem," wrote Deadline Hollywood, calling the ceremony "way too long."

Parasite wins top honour at Cannes
The Toronto Star

History was made and history repeated itself, albeit with a wicked twist, when Bong Joon-ho's Parasite won the Festival de Cannes' Palme d'Or on Saturday night. Bong, whose most recent films were Okja and Snowpiercer, is the first South Korean director to win Cannes' top prize, and his delight in the victory was visible when he shook his fist in triumph to the crowd as he approached the Palais des Festival stage. Parasite is a savage social satire that goes further than anyone will be expecting, detailing the ways that a family of heartless manipulators mercilessly takes advantage of clueless rich folks. And that's only the beginning.
Taking the Grand Prix, Cannes' runner-up prize, was a first feature, Mati Diop's Senegal-set Atlantics, a haunted and haunting film about star-crossed lovers that combines supernatural elements with social consciousness. Diop became the first Black female filmmaker to have a film play in Cannes competition.
The best actor award went to Antonio Banderas in Pedro Almodovar's quasi-autobiographical Pain and Glory, about a director at a crisis point in his life, and Banderas, who exaggerated the difficulty of climbing the stairs to the stage, paid unstinting tribute to his director. "We made eight movies together. I respect him. I admire him. I love him," the actor said. "The award has to be dedicated to him; I owe so much to him. We suffer a lot as actors; there's a lot of sacrifice, but there are also nights of glory, and this is my night of glory."
With both Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time ... In Hollywood and Terrence Malick's A Hidden Life shut out, the only English-language film to win a prize was the best actress award to Emily Beecham in Jessica Hausner's Little Joe.

Aladdin soars
at box office
Walt Disney Co.'s live-action remake of Aladdin crushed the competition at the box office over the weekend. Aladdin did better than expected, grossing an estimated $86.1 million (U.S.) to take the top spot at the North American box office. A musical-adventure directed by Guy Ritchie, Aladdin stars Will Smith, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott and draws heavily on the music and story of the 1992 animated film (the top earner of that year) that it's based on.
The top few spots at the box office were populated by known brands and sequels. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, now in its second weekend, placed second with $24.4 million. Avengers: Endgame took third with $16.8 million, and Pok#233;mon Detective Pikachu landed in fourth with $13.3 million. Sony's modestly budgeted horror movie Brightburn opened in fifth with $7.5 million. The James Gunn-produced film starring Elizabeth Banks puts a sinister spin on the Superman myth and has received mediocre reviews from critics. A surprise for many, however, was Booksmart, an Annapurna film distributed by United Artists Releasing, which debuted in sixth with only $6.5 million, despite excellent reviews and steady buzz from its SXSW film festival debut.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theatres, according to Comscore.

'Sonic' speeds to $57M debut; 'Parasite' sees big Oscar bump

Feb 19, 2020( MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  This image released by Paramount Pictures shows Sonic, voiced by Ben Schwartz, in a scene from "Sonic the Hedgehog ." (Paramount Pictures/Sega of America via AP)NEW YORK (AP) — The redesigned 'Sonic the Hedgehog' showed plenty of teeth at the box office, speeding to a $57 million debut, according to studio estimates Sunday, while 'Parasite' saw one of the largest post-Oscars bumps in years following its best picture win.  Paramount Pictures' 'Sonic the Hedgehog' came in well above expectations, especially for a movie that just months ago was a laughing stock. After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, 'Sonic' was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul — including fixing Sonic's eerily human teeth. 
 The makeover worked and audiences responded by making 'Sonic the Hedgehog" the weekend's top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation. For Paramount, it's a welcome success following misfires such as 'Gemini Man' and 'Terminator: Dark Fate.' The studio estimates 'Sonic' will gross $68 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.  'If you don't listen to your customer, and this goes for any business, then you're going to fail,' said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. 'We retooled Sonic in a way that was obviously very satisfying for the fans and they were very forgiving. Now that they've seen the movie, they love the movie. It all worked out.' The Sega video game adaptation, directed by Jeff Fowler, drew decent reviews (63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an A CinemaScore from moviegoers. The $87 million production co-stars Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik with Ben Schwartz supplying Sonic's voice.  Bong Joon Ho's 'Parasite' had its biggest weekend in its 19th week of release. Neon put 'Parasite' into its widest release yet (2,001 theaters) following its historic win at the Oscars. ('Parasite' was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.) And despite the film already being available for weeks on digital platforms and on DVD, its $5.5 million weekend is the largest Oscars bump for a best-picture winner since 'Gladiator' in 2001. (Ad) My proprietary e-book reveals the five proven systems and formulas you can use daily for the chance to win big. Find out how Pro Traders make profitable trades in bear and bull markets >> Last week's opening of 'Birds of Prey" followed up its limp debut by sliding to second with $17.1 million. Following its disappointing opening, some theaters retitled the movie 'Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey," instead of 'Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)." It was a busy weekend in theaters, with a handful of other new releases — 'The Photograph," 'Fantasy Island,' 'Downhill' — seeking to capitalize on both Valentine's Day on Friday and Presidents Day on Monday.  'Fantasy Island,' the Blumhouse horror remake of the '70s TV show, fared the best, collecting $12.4 million in ticket sales despite terrible reviews. Sony Pictures handled the release of the low-budget, PG-13 film, which earned just a 9% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes. Universal Pictures 'The Photograph,' a romance starring Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield and produced by Will Packer ("Girls Trip," 'Ride Along'), opened with $12.2 million. The film, written and directed by Stella Meghie, cost $15 million to make.  'Downhill,' from Disney's Fox Searchlight Pictures, debuted with $4.7 million, a modest start for a film starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell. A remake of the acclaimed Swedish film 'Force Majeure' by Ruben stlund, 'Downhill' didn't do great with critics but fared even worse with audiences. They gave it a D CinemaScore.  Neon followed up its 'Parasite' Oscar win with the Valentine's Day release of 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire,' one of 2019's most acclaimed films. Following a one-week qualifying run in December, Celine Sciamma's French period romance opened in 22 theaters with a strong per-theater average of about $20,000.

'Sonic' speeds to $57M debut; 'Parasite' sees big Oscar bump

NEW YORK (AP) - The redesigned "Sonic the Hedgehog" showed plenty of teeth at the box office, speeding to a $57 million debut, according to studio estimates Sunday, while "Parasite" saw one of the largest post-Oscars bumps in years following its best picture win.
Paramount Pictures' "Sonic the Hedgehog" came in well above expectations, especially for a movie that just months ago was a laughing stock. After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, "Sonic" was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul - including fixing Sonic's eerily human teeth.
The makeover worked and audiences responded by making "Sonic the Hedgehog" the weekend's top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation. For Paramount, it's a welcome success following misfires such as "Gemini Man" and "Terminator: Dark Fate." The studio estimates "Sonic" will gross $68 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.
"If you don't listen to your customer, and this goes for any business, then you're going to fail," said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. "We retooled Sonic in a way that was obviously very satisfying for the fans and they were very forgiving. Now that they've seen the movie, they love the movie. It all worked out."
The Sega video game adaptation, directed by Jeff Fowler, drew decent reviews (63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an A CinemaScore from moviegoers. The $87 million production co-stars Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik with Ben Schwartz supplying Sonic's voice.
Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite" had its biggest weekend in its 19th week of release. Neon put "Parasite" into its widest release yet (2,001 theaters) following its historic win at the Oscars. ("Parasite" was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.) And despite the film already being available for weeks on digital platforms and on DVD, its $5.5 million weekend is the largest Oscars bump for a best-picture winner since "Gladiator" in 2001.
Last week's opening of "Birds of Prey" followed up its limp debut by sliding to second with $17.1 million. Following its disappointing opening, some theaters retitled the movie "Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey," instead of "Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)."
It was a busy weekend in theaters, with a handful of other new releases - "The Photograph," "Fantasy Island," "Downhill" - seeking to capitalize on both Valentine's Day on Friday and Presidents Day on Monday.
"Fantasy Island," the Blumhouse horror remake of the '70s TV show, fared the best, collecting $12.4 million in ticket sales despite terrible reviews. Sony Pictures handled the release of the low-budget, PG-13 film, which earned just a 9% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes.
Universal Pictures "The Photograph," a romance starring Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield and produced by Will Packer ("Girls Trip," "Ride Along"), opened with $12.2 million. The film, written and directed by Stella Meghie, cost $15 million to make.
"Downhill," from Disney's Fox Searchlight Pictures, debuted with $4.7 million, a modest start for a film starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell. A remake of the acclaimed Swedish film "Force Majeure" by Ruben Östlund, "Downhill" didn't do great with critics but fared even worse with audiences. They gave it a D CinemaScore.
Neon followed up its "Parasite" Oscar win with the Valentine's Day release of "Portrait of a Lady on Fire," one of 2019's most acclaimed films. Following a one-week qualifying run in December, Celine Sciamma's French period romance opened in 22 theaters with a strong per-theater average of about $20,000.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
1. "Sonic the Hedgehog," $57 million ($44.3 million international).
2. "Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey," $17.1 million ($23 million international).

 The redesigned "Sonic the Hedgehog" showed plenty of teeth at the box office, speeding to a $57 million debut, according to studio estimates Sunday, while "Parasite" saw one of the largest post-Oscars bumps in years following its best picture win.
Paramount Pictures' "Sonic the Hedgehog" came in well above expectations, especially for a movie that just months ago was a laughing stock. After its first trailer was greeted with ridicule on social media last year, "Sonic" was postponed three months to give its title character a design overhaul - including fixing Sonic's eerily human teeth.
The makeover worked and audiences responded by making "Sonic the Hedgehog" the weekend's top film and the highest-grossing opening for a video game adaptation, not accounting for inflation. For Paramount, it's a welcome success following misfires such as "Gemini Man" and "Terminator: Dark Fate." The studio estimates "Sonic" will gross $68 million over the four-day Presidents Day holiday weekend.
"If you don't listen to your customer, and this goes for any business, then you're going to fail," said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. "We retooled Sonic in a way that was obviously very satisfying for the fans and they were very forgiving. Now that they've seen the movie, they love the movie. It all worked out."
The Sega video game adaptation, directed by Jeff Fowler, drew decent reviews (63% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an A CinemaScore from moviegoers. The $87 million production co-stars Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik with Ben Schwartz supplying Sonic's voice.
Bong Joon Ho's "Parasite" had its biggest weekend in its 19th week of release. Neon put "Parasite" into its widest release yet (2,001 theaters) following its historic win at the Oscars. ("Parasite" was the first non-English-language film to win best picture in the 92-year history of the Academy Awards.) And despite the film already being available for weeks on digital platforms and on DVD, its $5.5 million weekend is the largest Oscars bump for a best-picture winner since "Gladiator" in 2001.
Last week's opening of "Birds of Prey" followed up its limp debut by sliding to second with $17.1 million. Following its disappointing opening, some theaters retitled the movie "Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey," instead of "Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)."
It was a busy weekend in theaters, with a handful of other new releases - "The Photograph," "Fantasy Island," "Downhill" - seeking to capitalize on both Valentine's Day on Friday and Presidents Day on Monday.
"Fantasy Island," the Blumhouse horror remake of the '70s TV show, fared the best, collecting $12.4 million in ticket sales despite terrible reviews. Sony Pictures handled the release of the low-budget, PG-13 film, which earned just a 9% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes.
Universal Pictures "The Photograph," a romance starring Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield and produced by Will Packer ("Girls Trip," "Ride Along"), opened with $12.2 million. The film, written and directed by Stella Meghie, cost $15 million to make.
"Downhill," from Disney's Fox Searchlight Pictures, debuted with $4.7 million, a modest start for a film starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell. A remake of the acclaimed Swedish film "Force Majeure" by Ruben Östlund, "Downhill" didn't do great with critics but fared even worse with audiences. They gave it a D CinemaScore.
Neon followed up its "Parasite" Oscar win with the Valentine's Day release of "Portrait of a Lady on Fire," one of 2019's most acclaimed films. Following a one-week qualifying run in December, Celine Sciamma's French period romance opened in 22 theaters with a strong per-theater average of about $20,000.
Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.
1. "Sonic the Hedgehog," $57 million ($44.3 million international).
2. "Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey," $17.1 million ($23 million international).
3. "Fantasy Island," $12.4 million ($7.6 million international).

Was it good? I don't know.'Neon, the U.S. distributor of the movie, fired back at Trump's dis with a statement implying the president may have had an issue with the use of subtitles.Understandable, he can't read.#Parasite[6]#BestPicture[7]#Bong2020[8]
https://t.co/lNqGJkUrDP[9] — NEON (@neonrated) February 21, 2020[10] The New York-based film company wasn't the only one to shred Trump's taste in films.Elsewhere in his speech, the president unfavorably compared 'Parasite,' which won a total of four Academy Awards, to classic movies like 1950's'Sunset Boulevard[11]' and 1939's 'Gone With the Wind[12].'The latter film has, in recent years, been criticized for its demeaning stereotypes of Black characters[13] and 'romanticization[14]' of slavery before the Civil War.'It's bringing up 'Gone With the Wind' that raises this from simple xenophobic ignorance to real dada racism,' wrote The Nation's Jeet Heer[15].Charlotte Clymer[16] of the Human Rights Campaign added: 'Trump openly pining for 'Gone With the Wind' is the doggiest dogwhistle that ever dogwhistled.'

Oscar nominations preview: Will Parasite leech off The Irishman? Can Joaquin Phoenix rise once again?

India, Jan. 13 -- Who will be celebrating Oscar morning? Brad Pitt for sure. Jennifer Lopez almost certainly. And very possibly the Obamas, too.
Nominations for the 92nd Academy Awards, which will begin at 8:18 a.m. EST Monday (6:48 pm Sunday, IST), should bring plenty of star power to the February 9 ceremony - a good thing, too, since the show will for the second straight year go without a host.
Thankfully, this Oscar year isn't lacking for drama. Netflix is gunning for its first best picture win, a year after Alfonso Cuaron's"Roma fell just short. It has not just one but at least two contenders led by Martin Scorsese's elegiac crime epic The Irishman and Noah Baumbach's intimate divorce drama Marriage Story.
But in the lead up to Monday's nominations, much of the momentum has gone to a pair of movies that exalt the big screen with showmanship and celebrity: Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, with Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, and Sam Mendes' continuous World War I thrill ride, 1917. Hollywood, in the midst of a streaming upheaval, has so far favoured the traditionally released movies.
Still, no definite front-runner has emerged, and nominations morning could tip the scales anew in a rapid-paced awards season that, while not lacking for the usual battery of parties, screenings and Q&As, is more condensed than usual.
The nominations, to be read by Issa Rae and John Cho, will be live streamed on Oscar.com, Oscars.org and the academy's digital social platforms. The second wave of nominees will begin at 8:30 a.m. EST and be carried live on Good Morning America.
The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences select anywhere from five to 10 nominees for best picture, depending on how many first-placed votes a film gets. That's usually meant eight or nine movies. This year, the precursor guild nominations have suggested the sure things are Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood, 1917, The Irishman, Taika Waititi's JoJo Rabbit and Bong Joon Ho's Parasite.
That leaves a few slots to be battled out by Joker, Little Women, Ford v Ferrari, Knives Out, Bombshell and The Farewell.
Parasite will be the first Korean film ever nominated for an Oscar but it's likely to land several nominations, including Bong for best director and possibly Song Kang Ho for best supporting actor.
The director category will be especially closely watched. Though Greta Gerwig (Little Women) is a possibility, the academy is expected to nominate an all-male field despite a year in which women made significant gains behind the camera. The academy has nominated only men for best director in all but five years; Gerwig was the last woman nominated, two years ago.
In the acting categories, Renee Zellweger (Judy) has consistently led the best actress contenders. Should Awkwafina be nominated, she would be only the second woman of Asian descent nominated in the category. (The first, 1936 nominee Merle Oberon, hid her South Asian heritage.)
Pitt has a lock on the supporting actor Oscar, which would be his first ever. Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and Lopez have led the supporting actress nominees. A nomination would be the first for Lopez.
The best actor category, after a few lacklustre years, has been especially competitive, with Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) and Adam Driver (Marriage Story) as the most entrenched nominees in a field including DiCaprio, Antonio Banderas (Pain and Glory), Christian Bale (Ford v Ferrari), Eddie Murphy (Dolemite Is My Name), Adam Sandler (Uncut Gems) and Robert De Niro (The Irishman).
While a similar result Monday is unlikely, the British Film Academy last week nominated an all-white field of acting nominees. Widely criticized, the BAFTAs pledged to review its awards process.
Beyonce will likely add an Oscar nomination to her many honours, for her Lion King song. American Factory, the first release from Barack and Michelle Obama's production company, Higher Ground, is likely to be among the documentary nominees.
After the most dominant box-office year in Hollywood history, the Walt Disney Co. will have reasons to celebrate Monday, though their top films - including the record-setting Marvel blockbuster Avengers: Endgame - are expected to be largely relegated to categories like best visual effects. The studio, which has never won a best picture Academy Award, does have a few contenders via its acquisition in April of 20th Century Fox. Both Ford v Ferrari and Jojo Rabbit (released by specialty label Fox Searchlight) will compete in the top categories.
The 92nd Academy Awards will take place Feb. 9 in Los Angeles at the Dolby Theatre. ABC will again broadcast the show, viewership for which last year rose 12% to 29.6 million.

Feb 10, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite made Oscar history as the first foreign language film[1] to win the Best Picture Award. Bong Joon Ho's tale[2] of con artists living off a rich family finally crossed that boundary. Other foreign language films have made it to the final round, but lost to a traditional English-language film.  Parasite wins Best Picture at the Oscars including Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, Choi Woo-shik, Kang-Ho Song,Yang Jin-mo, Jin Won Han, Kwak Sin-ae, Ha-jun Lee, Yang-kwon Moon, Kang-ho Song, Yeo-jeong Jo, Bong Joon-ho, and Sun-kyun Lee | Kevin Winter/Getty Images Parasite was already in good company with these other nominees, but if you're interested in the history behind this landmark victory[3], here are some of the other foreign language films The Academy[4] nominated in the past. 
One year before #8216;Parastie,' #8216;Roma' had a good chance at the Best Picture Oscar Alfonso Cuaron[5]'s 2018 film Roma was an Oscar favorite. Cuaron based his black and white drama about maid (Yalitza Aparicio[6]) for a wealthy Mexican family on his own life[7] growing up. Roma still won Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director and Best Cinematography, but Green Book ultimately won Best Picture. Yalitza Aparicio in Roma | Alfonso Cuarón/Netflix Roma's success was enough to make Steven Spielberg[8] launch a campaign to disqualify Netflix[9] from Oscar nominations. So far, Netflix is still in, as The Irishman[10] got lots of nominations too. In 2013, #8216;Amour' was the sole foreign language Best Picture nominee Michael Haneke's 2012 French film Amour was a brutal drama about an 80-something stroke victim (Emmanuelle Riva) who wanted to end her life. Her husband (Jean-Louis Trintignant) tried to care for her, facing more and more resistance. Emmanuelle Riva in Amour | Films du Losange/Sony Pictures Classics Amour won the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. The Academy nominated Haneke for Best Director and Best Screenplay and Riva for her performance. Argo won Best Picture that year. #8216;Babel' and #8216;Letters From Iwo Jima' were technically foreign language films Babel was a multi-narrative story traversing multiple cultures. As such it had stories in Spanish, in Japanese, in Arabic and in sign language. It also had an American story with Brad Pitt[11] and Cate Blanchett[12] speaking English.Letters from Iwo Jima was a Clint Eastwood[13] movie. He directed the Japanese perspective on WWII as a companion to his film Flags of Our Fathers. Much of Letters isin Japanese with English subtitles, but there are also English speaking characters and it is a Hollywood production. #8216;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' was the last Asian Best Picture nominee before #8216;Parasite' Ang Lee[14]'s martial arts epic landed a Best Picture nominee. Lee would have to settle for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Cinematography for Peter Pau, Best Original Score for Tan Dun and Best Art Direction for Tim Yip. Gladiator won Best Picture that year.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was a Hong Kong/Taiwanese film. The actors spoke Mandarin. Parastie is a Korean film in Korean language. #8216;Life Is Beautiful' and #8216;Il Postino' were Italian Oscar nominees Roberto Benigni achieved a remarkable feat with his 1998 film Life Is Beautiful. He made a comedy about the Holocaust. He would win Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film for it, and his composer Nicola Piovani would win Best Score. Shakespeare in Love took home Best Picture Roberto Benigni at the Oscars with Sophia Loren (R) | Timothy A. Clary/AFP via Getty Images 1995's Il Postino was a whimsical love story about a postman with a crush. He learns poetry from a poet whose mail he delivers, and those poems, and all other dialogue, are in Italian. Il Postino got the Best Picture nomination but not Best Foreign Language Film. It won for Best Score, but not Best Actor for the late Massimo Troisi or Director Michael Radford either but Braveheart won Best Picture. Earlier foreign films nominated for Best Picture Oscars For the sake of completion, here are a few more early foreign language films that landed the Best Picture nomination. 1937's French film Grand Illusion, 1968's French/Algerian Z, 1971's Swedish The Immigrants and 1972's Swedish Cries and Whispers.All in all, only 12 foreign language films ever got close to a Best Picture Oscar, and only 10 if you disqualify Babel and Letters from Iwo Jima. Hopefully Parasite is the first of many.
