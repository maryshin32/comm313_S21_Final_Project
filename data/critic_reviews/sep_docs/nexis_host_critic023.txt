THE HOST
(M, 118 minutes) On general release
In Bong Joon-ho's entertaining but overlong monster movie, toxic chemicals released into Seoul's Han River seem to be linked to the appearance of a marauding mutant which is also believed to be the host of a deadly virus. The often-startling visual effects complement an uneasy mixture of humour and horror.
