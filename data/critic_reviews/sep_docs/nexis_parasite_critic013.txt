The good news is that the theater's lineup is among the best in the area, especially considering that one of the films it is screening just won a Golden Globe[2].That film is "Parasite,"[3] the latest offering from the Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho. "Parasite" became the first Korean film ever to win a Golden Globe, and it is in line to nab Bong his first Academy Award (nominations will be announced[4] Jan. 13 with the awards ceremony itself scheduled for Feb. 9)."Parasite" is getting rave reviews, scoring a 96 among 48 critics on Metacritic[5], 99 among some 348commentators on Rotten Tomatoes.[6]Joe Morgenstern, Wall Street Journal: "Imagine a high-wire act where the acrobat suddenly leaps to a higher wire, then to another that's higher still. It's the best way I can think of to describe the giddy thrill of watching 'Parasite,'a masterpiece of serial surprises from the Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho."Leah Greenblatt[7], Entertainment Weekly: "If the movie is a Rorschach of who you identify as parasite and host, it's a test you're just as likely to fail; a filmgoing experience that refuses to fit into any box, and forces viewers to breathe the dangerous air outside of it, too."Jessica Kiang[8], Variety: "Bong is back and on brilliant form, but he is unmistakably, roaringly furious, and it registers because the target is so deserving, so enormous, so2019: 'Parasite'is a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage."Wow. Can't remember the last time I ever read of a film being described as "a tick fat with the bitter blood of class rage."Wish I'd thought of that.Below: Watch Bong Joon-ho give a succinct bit of advice to moviegoers (wait for the translation).[embedded content] [ 1]: https://www.magiclanternonmain.com [ 2]:            https://www.goldenglobes.com [ 3]:            https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 [ 4]:            https://www.oscars.org/oscars/92nd-oscars-shortlists [ 5]:            https://www.metacritic.com/movie/parasite [ 6]:            https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/parasite_2019 [ 7]:            https://ew.com/movie-reviews/2019/10/09/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho/ [ 8]:            https://variety.com/2019/film/reviews/parasite-review-1203221435/
