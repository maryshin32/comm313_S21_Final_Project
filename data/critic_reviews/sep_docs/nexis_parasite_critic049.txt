India, Feb. 10 -- The 92nd Academy Awards started off on script but also delivered a few surprises: Brad Pitt won his first acting Oscar for his performance in Once Upon on a Time ... In Hollywood, Laura Dern won the Best Supporting Actress award and Joaquin Phoenix won Best Actor. Bong Joon Ho won the Best Director Oscar and Parasite took best original screenplay, the inaugural best international feature award, and in a major, history-making upset, the Best Picture award..
The class satire Parasite, which many believe has a chance to upset the front-runner 1917 for best picture, pulled off surprise after surprise. It is tied with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Ford v 1917 for three Oscars.

As it did last year, the annual Dolby Theatre ceremony kicked off without a host. Janelle Monae opened the show entering a Mister Rogers set and singing A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.
"I'm so proud to be standing here as a black queer artist telling stories,' said Monae. 'Happy Black History Month."
Two former Oscar hosts, Chris Rock and Steve Martin, dropped in to supply an opening monologue. Martin called it "an incredible demotion." Martin noted that something was missing from this year's directing nominees. "Vaginas!' Rock replied.
