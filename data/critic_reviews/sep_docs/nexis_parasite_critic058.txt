Expanding to 461 screens in North America, 'Parasite' continued its strong run at the indie box office this weekend, grossing $2.6 million and bringing its domestic total to $7.5 million. Its global total grew to $108 million, making it the first film from Joon-ho to gross over $100 million worldwide, passing his career high $89 million earned by his 2006 monster film 'The Host.'

As with all Netflix theatrical releases, box office numbers are not being reported, but the film will expand to independent cinemas in top 10 markets next weekend. In timing with the release, The New York Times[3] posted a report on the failed negotiations between Netflix and theater chains to give 'The Irishman' wide distribution. 'This is a major director, a cinephile, who has made all kinds of important movies for our industry,' Fithian said. 'And 'The Irishman'is going to play on one-tenth of the screens it should have played on, had Netflix been willing to come to an understanding with our members.'
