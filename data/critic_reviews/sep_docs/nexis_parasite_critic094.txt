On Jan. 19, the cast of Parasite won the award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

The actors in 'Parasite' were snubbed by the Oscars  While Parasite still made history with its Academy Award nominations, the actors of the film were wrongfully snubbed.  'Overlooked Great Acting' headline held by #Parasite[5] director Bong Joon Ho, with cast members Park So-dam and Song Kang-ho pointing. #Parasite[6] actors were all snubbed by the Academy despite the film receiving 6 Oscar nominations.

It's boring to talk about, but it must be said that there's a persistent prejudice against Asian actors within Hollywood,' said[10] Vulture writer E. Alex Jung.He continued[11], 'There's an old prejudice at work here that sees Asian people as technical workers —hence the praise for Bong Joon Ho —and refuses to see us as fully human.'The Los Angeles Times also called out the snubs by the Academy. 'Some might argue that the seamlessness and coherence of the 'Parasite' ensemble may actually have worked against it, keeping any single actor from standing out. To me, that argument is not just false on its face but ugly in its insinuations: It comes close to perpetuating a hoary canard about Asian actors and Asian people in general, which is that they're indistinguishable and interchangeable,' wrote[12] Justin Chang.  Good morning, Parasites. pic.twitter.com/kcFMtfxo4t[13] — NEON (@neonrated) January 20, 2020[14] 'Parasite' made history again with its SAG win Unlike the Oscars, the SAG Awards got it right. Not only was the cast of Parasite nominated, the cast members took home the award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. In doing so, Parasite became the first foreign-langue film to win the award. Parasite is only the second foreign-language film to be nominated for the award. 1997 Italian comedy-drama Life Is Beautiful was the last foreign-language film to be nominated in the same category[15]. The win is warranted given the talent of the cast and the acclaim surrounding the movie. It also shows just how out of touch the Academy Awards are. With the major SAG Awards win, Parasite has gained even more momentum for the upcoming Academy Awards.
