Bong Joon Ho's Parasite -- winner of this year's Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival -- has gotten a release date with distributor Neon. 
Parasite will hit theaters on Oct. 11 in Los Angeles and New York before receiving a platformed release that will expand the film onto more screens. The fall release places the feature, a foreign film frontrunner, in contention for awards season. 
Joon Ho's modern fairy tale received universal praise after its debut, earning a 97 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Hollywood Reporter review says the movie "packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times." 
Parasite follows two families -- the wealthy Parks and the street smart Kims -- whose entangled lives are threatened by greed and class prejudices. 
Also opening on Oct. 11 will be Ang Lee's Gemini Man, starring Will Smith, and Sony's long-awaited Zombieland sequel.
