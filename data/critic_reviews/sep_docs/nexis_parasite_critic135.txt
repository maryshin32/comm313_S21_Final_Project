Apart from the Oscars, Parasite[2] has also won numerous awards.

The film also won the Best Original Screenplay, and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture for 2020, among many others. Parasite revolves around the tale of two families. One is quite rich and well-to-do. Meanwhile the other is poor and will go to any lengths to make ends meet. The emphasis on class discrimination, greed and apathy are brought to light when the families meet and enter a unique inter-dependent relationship.  https://www.bgr.in/news/pornhub-offering-premium-to-everyone-for-free-to-encourage-staying-at-home-coronavirus-882384/Also ReadPornhub made Premium free for everyone to encourage staying home[3]Amazon also recently made a bunch of content free on its Prime Video platform.
