In “Parasite,” a poor family figures out a few tricky ways to earn their livelihood from one particular rich family. This scene shows them executing one of their deceptions, while simultaneously showing them rehearse for the moment.
The sequence plays a bit like an action scene from the television series “Mission: Impossible,” which the director, Bong Joon Ho, cited as inspiration. 
Additionally, the process of acting and directing is deconstructed in the scene as the son (Choi Woo Shik), gives performance notes to his father (Song Kang Ho) about the manipulative story they’re spinning. In his narration of the scene, Bong discusses working with his actors to give the moment an improvisational feel.
