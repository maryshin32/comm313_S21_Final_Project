Aug 16, 2019( indieWIRE: http://indiewire.com Delivered by Newstex)  With film festivals in Venice, Telluride, and Toronto mere weeks away, the fall movie season is already upon us, and with it comes the real start of Oscar season. However, even as anticipation rises for many of the high profile offerings with the potential to gain awards momentum, there are several beloved 2019 films that already screened earlier this year and are eager to remain in the conversation. Case in point: Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho's 'Parasite[1],' a darkly comic tale of class warfare, won the Palme d'Or at Cannes way back in May, but the film is about to relaunch in the heat of Oscar season with prime slots on the fall circuit. 
The critically acclaimed title seems like an obvious contender for Best International Film, but the film's distributor has much bigger plans. 'Parasite' is primed to receive a campaign in major categories — but will Academy voters see beyond its 'foreign language' status as they did for Alfonso Cuarón and 'Roma' last year? That's one of the big questions at the center of this week's Screen Talk[2] episode, as Eric Kohn and Anne Thompson anticipate the developing campaign. They also talk about new additions to the TIFF[3] lineup, including many promising documentaries[4] and a few bigger narrative entries, from 'Lucy in the Sky' to 'Waves.'
