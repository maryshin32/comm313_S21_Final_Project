If Sunday's Golden Globe awards have left you excited for all things film, the good news is that you'll be able to see some of the winning titles in the UAE very soon.
While some of the night's big winners, such as Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood and Joker, have already hit screens around the world, others are yet to make it to the UAE big screen.
One of the night's most talked about winners was Korean film Parasite, which took the Golden Globe for best foreign language film, the first South Korean movie to ever win in the event's 77-year history.
Directed by Bong-Joon Ho, Parasite is a parable of class, family and privilege, centred around a poor Korean family that insinuates itself into the lives of a wealthy family.
Accepting the award, Bong Joon-ho said, via a translator, "Once you overcome the one inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."
The film debuted in October to rave reviews, leading it to be named the year's best film by the National Society of Film Critics. However, Parasite will premiere at cinemas across the UAE on Thursday, January 16.
Taking home the biggest prize of the night was 1917, the First World War epic directed by Sam Mendes, who was also named best director for the picture, which is made to look as though it has been filmed in one continuous shot. The ambitious picture was named Best Motion Picture – Drama, beating the likes of The Irishman, Jojo Rabbit, and Marriage Story.

Mendes's film took the prize ahead of its global cinema release, which will no doubt entice movie fans to theatres in their droves when it is released in the UAE on Thursday, January 9. It should also stand it in good stead ahead of the Oscars, which are set to take place in February.
