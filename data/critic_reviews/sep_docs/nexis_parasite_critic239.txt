I liked it so much, I took my wife to see it again on Saturday. Ram-don again. Also called Jjapaguri or Jjapaghetti: Ultimately, instant noodles and steak. A marriage of cheap, convenient instant noodles and the king of the protein mountain, steak. It was somewhere in the afterglow of the second screening on Saturday, I received an invite to lunch at Taste of Korea on Sunday.Ram-don!
 Did Taste of Korea Ha have it on the menu? Couldn't remember, so I had to find out. I'd also heard a distressing rumor owner Sun Ha was planning to close Taste of Korea, which I hoped wasn't true.Turns out Taste of Korea doesn't have ram-don on the menu, and it is going to close before the end of the month.Sounds like all bad news, but it's not.The good news is japchae is on the menu, and it's plenty close to ram-don. You've got until Feb. 23 to find out. Furthermore, the closing isn't necessarily permanent. Sun and her husband have an extended vacation to South Korea planned after the lease runs out on the property at the unfortunate location of 5 S Western Ave.When they return from vacation, they'll make a final determination on the future. As for now, they're looking for a new home for Taste of Korea in case the answer is yes to continuing.[img hash="302c56fd6016c50b0aada982875e80a6" width="" height="" align="center" render="w620" caption="Seafood pajeon from Taste of Korea in Oklahoma City. &#91;Dave Cathey/The Oklahoman&#93;" ]22[/img][img hash="49bb09b15de57f087d5749ca19bed9ee" width="280" height="" align="left" render="w280" caption="Fried dumplings from Taste of Korea in Oklahoma City. &#91;Dave Cathey/The Oklahoman&#93;" ]22[/img]Knowing all that made for a sweet Sunday afternoon basking in yaki mandu, haemul pajeon, haemul sundubu jjigae, bibimbap, ojingeo bokkeum, jjamppong, bulgogi, and the aforementioned ram-don alternative japchae.If that seems like a lot of consonant-on-consonant crimes, it is. But the pleasure of eating it is completely guilt-free. [img hash="efbd46b59e67936721e07dc0d712e7d9" width="" height="" align="center" render="w620" caption="Bulgogi and ojingeo bokkeum from Taste of Korea in Oklahoma City. &#91;Dave Cathey/The Oklahoman&#93;" ]22[/img]I've eaten pajeon, a crispy seafood pancake, several times at Taste of Korea since it opened back in 2017. Same for the bulgogi (sweet and spicy marinated beef), yaki mandu (fried chicken dumplings) and dolsot bibimbap (a hot pot of rice, vegetables, meat, gochujang chile sauce and egg). Never found any inconsistency in their excellence. [img hash="daf4429bdf3efba44f292aaf0446873d" width="320" height="" align="left" render="w320" caption="Banchan from Taste of Korea in Oklahoma City. &#91;Dave Cathey/The Oklahoman&#93;" ]22[/img]New to me was ojingeo bokkeum, a stir-fry of squid and vegetables in a spicy sauce. It was a fantastic topping for steamed jasmine rice or just the odd pluck between bites of pajeon. If the pronunciation scares you, go with No. 17.That goes for No. 19, too, also known as haemul jjigae. This bowl of unabashed flavor-joy begins with a broth for the ages, spicy, balanced, addictive. The soft tofu plays like a mild, heart-smart crema and the seafood is magic. Japchae might be more familiar. It's a stir-fry of beef, sweet potato starch noodles and vegetables. About midway through the meal, I wondered aloud if we were generating some good mojo for "Parasite" at the Academy Awards later that evening. Our table certainly hoped so.[img hash="3f0556236e50012c2972b26d25978402" width="280" height="" align="left" render="w280" caption="Soft tofu and seafood soup from Taste of Korea in Oklahoma City. &#91;Dave Cathey/The Oklahoman&#93;" ]22[/img]Though in all honesty, I had no inkling it would actually win. My view of film has become increasingly jaded. I hated it but understood when "Birdman," drew more votes from Academy members than "Boyhood" back in 2015. Of course the Academy related better to a deep-dive into the heart of darkness that is an actor's ego over a simple story about a kid growing up between suburban and rural Texas. But "Green Book"??? How can you not wonder if film has simply devolved into a moderate-risk vehicle for carefully curated and marketed commercial ventures when a film as abjectly average as "Green Book" is even nominated as one of the best handful of films in a year, much less win the award?This year didn't look terribly promising unless you were Quentin Tarantino, who had to think he was the prohibitive favorite on the strength of "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" when all it had to face was the inexplicably nominated "Joker," two films from Netflix and the novel but dull "1917." I adored Greta Gerwig's "Little Women," but found it laughable that the best part of the film (Gerwig's directorial spin on the oft-told tale) didn't get nominated.I kept hearing about how great "Parasite" was but couldn't imagine a foreign horror movie would win Best Picture.[img hash="7cc171410f13557df28e2fc6c691a478" width="" height="" align="center" render="w620" caption="Cho Yeo-jeong in "Parasite."" ]22[/img]Then I saw the film. About a half hour before it was over, I took advantage of the empty theater to text a friend of mine the following: "Stop whatever you're doing and figure out how you can see 'Parasite' as soon as possible."That text, which I edited to remove one or two curse words sparked by my exuberance, was sent somewhere between the question: "What the hell is ram-don?" and the last time we hear the exclamation "Respect!""Parasite" is why we love going to the movies, a chance to play along with a self-solving puzzle. To reap the satisfaction of the resolution on schedule and on time. Maybe even ahead. Meanwhile, the magic of cinema has always been its ability to transcend that very simple pleasure.[img hash="4df9caacc146fd80984750e2225a7d2e" width="" height="" align="center" render="w620" caption="Park So-dam and Choi Woo-shik in "Parasite."" ]22[/img]Now that the pleasure of popcorn cinema can be streamed where ever we might be in the world in relation to a cell tower, the job of the theater is harder than ever to offer incentive to get folks to buy a ticket."Parasite" checks every box for going to the theater.If you haven't seen the film, I will tell you It is not a horror film as I first assumed.It's hard to label the film. Maybe a suspense-thriller hiding a kidnapped sociological horror show in the shadows of a stylish dark comedy. Playfully intertwined narratives threaded to the fortunes of a pair of failed pastry chefs seeking relief from debilitating debt through the same opportunity.[img hash="6d73d0cf021a8b04a08dfce238e104f0" width="" height="" align="center" render="w620" caption="Kang-Ho Song in "Parasite."" ]22[/img]If you want a full-blown review, click here to read a review  from October. But trust me when I tell, once the ram-don is cleaned from the bowl, "Parasite" begins its final reveal.All the while, the film drips with visual cues and style, comedy both broad and razor-sharp, a terrific score, and fiendish performances from a cast who appears to revel in the knowledge audiences will likely wonder what exactly it is they're watching but once they figure it out, they might just think it was the best thing they'd seen all year. Longer, probably.[img hash="4b8b60924e8e317179e63ecd180e87d1" width="" height="" align="center" render="w620" caption="Bong Joon-ho." ]22[/img]Director Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece is an amalgamation of genre's seamlessly tethered to human drama balanced by deliciously off-beat comedy and ruthless tragedy. Would love to believe our pop-up feast at Taste of Korea sent the last dash of mojo needed to send "Parasite" over the line, but I'm happy with the pre-Oscar mojo the meal gave me.  Wouldn't it be nice if we could pass this on to Sun Ha and her family as they prepare to close shop.Very metaphorical, indeed.
