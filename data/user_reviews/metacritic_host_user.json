It is something completely different. It is one of the best 'monster movies,' if not the best, that I have ever seen. It is full of drama and darkish humor. It develops the characters extremely well, even succeeding in giving the monster personality. The struggles that the characters go through are real and do not seem to be fabricated for cinematic effect (besides the monster) and therefore do not leave you with any unanswered questions or loose ends. It is intense, although it is able to calm itself down in times of character development and more intellectual interaction between the characters. It involves much more than the standard Man Vs. Monster theme as seen in so many other movies of its kind. The only gripe I would have with this movie would be the very beginning because it makes it slightly corny. But, nonetheless, you forget about that and any questions of why there is a 50 ft fish going around and eating people are eliminated. The presence of the monster becomes noticeable on a perfect scale as the story progresses. It does an excellent job of showing societal reaction to the monster and makes sure that the magnitude of the public and government reaction is not allowed to go out of control save for maybe some over-the-top government action (but, hey, its Korea). All in all, I'd say that this movie is fast-paced when it needs to be, but also allows itself to have emotional and heartfelt themes.\u2026 Expand"}, {"date": "Feb 25, 2008", "score": "5", "text": "The dialog, or lack thereof, pretty much killed this movie for me.

Upon viewing \"The Host\" trailer, and with vivid memories of how silly and loveable \"Kung Fu Hustle\" was, I became thoroughly excited about the potential for yet another clever and funny Asian movie. Then once I read the movie critics' praises for \"The Host\" I was certain that I was in store for a silly bagful of thrills, laughs, and scares all wrapped up in a thoroughly enjoyable Asian monster movie. Unfortunately the movie does not live up to its billing. To have compared this movie to \"Jaws\", as one critic did, is a total and misleading overreaction. \"The Host\" has a couple of thrilling moments, but it isn't thrilling. It has a few funny moments, but it isn't a funny. And it has a few scary moments, but the it just isn't scary. I'll have to admit that the movie had me on the edge of my seat, but that was only because I was anxious to leave. Perhaps it was the political satire that was so appealing to those that loved this movie. Maybe that's the answer. If you're looking for political satire, then you too may love \"The Host\".
