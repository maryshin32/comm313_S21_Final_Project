The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched.Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house.Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hidingThe only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal.Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come.\u2026 Expand", "score": "9"}, {"date": "Apr 13, 2021", "text": "this movies is a 10 this movies is a 10 this movies is a 10 this movies is a 10", "score": "10"}, {"date": "Mar 31, 2021", "text": "this film is something else personally i think its the best film of 2019All the characters have dept and the story is unbelievable but the acting makes it seem absolutely possible. great", "score": "10"}, {"date": "Mar 28, 2021", "text": "A stark, unapologetic, Hitchcockian, and engrossing film about 2 families and their differences in their respective social classes.

Bong Joon Ho, 2019, South Korea]: The Novelty Of Reading Subtitles.I think some foreign language films become overrated due to many movie-watchers not being book-readers, or, the novelty of reading whilst 'watching' (glancing up between dialogue) is probably where people are deriving pleasure.You're barely able to watch the film while you're reading the subtitles at the bottom of the screen, so you're unable to judge the acting and cinematography. They're speaking in a foreign language too, so it's impossible to rate the delivery of lines. I doubt this film is rated as highly by Koreans.Parasite is good, quite original, but certainly overrated. The story is reasonably straight forward, and not the mysterious thriller the original trailer advertises it to be.The comedy only exist as humorous moments that can exist in everyday life, whilst the drama isn't believable or impactful.Who is the titular 'parasite'? Well, we can assume all the people working for the wealthy family are the parasites. It's a quick development of the plot when an entire impoverished family rapidly gain employment at the rich family's lavish home through skilled deception, skills which seem unlikely in origin according to earlier scenes. Of course, their new source of income goes off-rails as quickly as it had begun, but certainly not in a deep, 'Hitchcockian', or clever way.Many elements of the film are not fleshed out or are dead ends: The family went from folding pizza boxes to being master conmen; What was the relevance of the ornamental rock?; Why did the young man basically adopt the life of his friend?; Why was it briefly implied the rich man didn't love his wife?; What were the drugs he mentioned he'd buy her?; What became of the boy's deciphered Morse code?; How did the young man send a letter to his father?; Was the end a dream?So, Parasite is not a funny film, and not particularly thrilling, dramatic, clever, or suspenseful. The (music) score is ok, but it's hard to comment on the acting as it's a foreign language movie, and the photography is hard to judge when you're reading the almost non-stop text at the bottom of the screen. There's no particular moral to the story to learn, other than, maybe, not pushing your luck, and tolerating an unpleasant smell.However, from the originality, and what you can discern from the plot, it's still an engaging film - even if that's largely from the novelty of reading subtitles.7/10 - Not as good as Cinema Paradiso [1988, Director's Cut, 173 min].\u2026 Expand", "score": "7"}, {"date": "Mar  9, 2021", "text": "Took me too long to review this one as I forgot to review it.

I was not expecting a foreign language, occurring in a foreign society would affect me so much. Since engaging with another society far from your culture is rather perplexing especially in a movie But, every element of this movie was so well put together that dragged the audience from the beginning to the end without a blink. The ending was not maybe what viewers anticipated from the beginning, but it wasn't too far out of sight either. The soundtracks were meticulously composed with a purpose for each scene to convey the emotion that the director wants to the audience. Because Parasite has played with all my emotions from happiness to sorrow throughout the film and the soundtracks along with the actors were exceptional in deliberating this story to us. This movie pictures the extreme gap between the classes in a society. The story begins with a family who is struggling to make ends meet by folding pizza boxes and selling them and live in half of the basement in a very poor neighbourhood. Their son is taking over a friend's job to teach English in a very wealthy house. The family one by one find their way into the wealthy family household by working for them, from cook to chauffeur. The movie started as a comedy then shifts to a thriller, drama and eventually a bit of horror. The movie is shedding light on the problems of society that is rarely talked about. It has made me realize there are struggles in the society that we don't see. The working poor and underclass are not right in front of us. We are all living in one place, but they are the ones who have to crumple in half a basement with the very poor living condition. TIf you want an eye-opening movie that shows you the brutalities of a capitalist world, then this is the movie for you. It makes you wonder what else is happening in a society that you have no slightest idea? It gives you insights into rarely discussed struggles in societies that don't care much about the poor. I don't want to spoil it more than I did already, but I have deeply been thinking about the effect of society on people. What one might do to reach the top?

Without symbols, a movie can never reach the depths of emotion that it might. The rock, for example, is a really good symbol. I think it represents the family's aspirations  for wealth, and also represents a blessing that will bring them wealth (as Min said). It becomes a powerful metaphor when you see the basement dwelling guy use it to bash Ki-woo (the son)'s head. What I think this means is that poor people often sabotage other poor people's chances for wealth (the basement dweller trying to kill Ki-woo). And sometimes it's our own dreams (like the rock) that destroy us. The metaphor becomes even more meaningful when you see that the rock was fake (as rocks can't float in water, yet this rock floated in the sewage when the house was flooded), meaning that the \"blessing that was going to give them material wealth\" was never actually going to happen. This poor family will stay poor forever, as Ki-taek (the father) represents. Ki-taek was constantly reminded of his place in society by his smell. No matter how much he tried to fit in with the rich family as their driver, he always smelled bad. And that solidified his place as a poor person. When Mr. Park (the rich family's father) was going to get the keys from under the basement dweller's body, he was absolutely repulsed by the smell of poverty that the basement dweller emitted. Ki-taek, with his daughter (and the family's only chance of being rich, as she was the only one who fit in with the rich people) dying beneath him, finally snapped at seeing this aversion to the smell of poor people. Because to Ki-taek, this disgust that Mr. Park displayed towards the \"poor smell\", represented the disgust that Mr. Park had for poor people. Including him. So he killed him out of rage and desperation. These are just some of the symbols in Parasite.There were also other good elements in the movie. The acting, suspense, plot, visual design, sound design and camerawork were all great. But the symbols, for me, are what solidify the movie's rating as a 10.

In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d\u2019Or win, \u201cParasite\u201d has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony, but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles.In a way, \u201cParasite\u201d feels like the \u201cInception\u201d of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan\u2019s towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. \u201cParasite\u201d, on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures\u2014 it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan\u2019s pic \u2014comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling.  Script-wise, \u201cParasite\u201d is an utter knockout. At first glance, the most outstanding, praised features the film exposes now and again are its turns and twists, the comings and goings of a story where everything mutes into something unexpected. These \u201cthink-again\u201d premium plot devices are the main pulling force for mainstream audiences, even though they are not the most powerful assets Joon-Ho has to offer. The truly one-of-a-kind centerpieces are: proceedings and composition. Take for instance the 5-minute towering montage at the end of the first act, where black humor, cadence and rhythm are the beating heart of the sequence. It builds and places anticipation at the highest level by using endless narrative tricks to convey the emotions and reactions the film intends to spring up, blurring the line between good and bad, between wealth and the poverty, between sarcasm and irony. Every one of the characters succeeds at becoming storytelling backbones because of the amazing ensemble cast, which\u2014 by the way \u2014became the very first foreign Ensemble Winner at SAG Awards, making, one more time, movie history. Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Cho Yeo-jeong, and Song Kang-ho deliver award-worthy performances, endowing to the story tangible, three-dimensional characters that, in incompetent hands, would come out as hollow caricatures.    Bong Joon-Ho\u2019s pictures are described as many things at once: black comedies, social commentaries, genre-crossing post-apocalyptic adventures. Owning every inch of them, \u201cParasite\u201d spices the mix up with deeper, timely metaphors\u2014 make no mistake, peaches and basements are not going to be the same; \u2014 however, the film owes it to two crucial aspects: visual language and edition. Camera movements, blocking and visual composition are masterfully managed by the director and his crew. It could have been a silent film, and still it would speak volumes. Cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo executes his vision with perverse precision and voyeuristic delight, grabbing class divide by the throat. What could have ended up as a mere style exercise between the shady lighting from the semi-basement and the luxury LED lighting of the main mansion, it is now the perfect visual cocktail:  sophistication and softness, luxury and poverty, ups and downs, dark and light, hungry beasts in empty spaces. \u201cGisaengchung\u201d by Bong Joon-Ho is the crowning achievement of the decade. Many critics have healed it as \u201cthe picture of the year\u201d and, even if it is tout \u00e0 fait true, \u201cParasite\u201d transcends the boundaries of society-headed, industry-transforming films; say Jordan Peele\u2019s ambitious allegory \u201cUs\u201d reimagined through the lens and voices of Shakespeare, Hitchcock and Kim Ki-young, and still you are nowhere near to it. Many talented, socially-aware filmmakers and their equally committed crews have paved the way through the years; now Bong Joon-Ho, in total command of his craft, has made it: \u201cParasite\u201d is a groundbreaking work of art.\u2026 Expand", "score": "10"}, {"date": "Jun  6, 2020", "text": "Over rated.

With the rich father being more disgusted by the smell than the carnage itself.

In an interview, Bong stated that calling lower-class individuals, people who have no feasible means of class mobility, parasites is missing the point; it is the upper class who saps off the lower class via class warfare and exploitation who are the real parasites. In this way and many more, Parasite likely doesn\u2019t affirm the viewer\u2019s world view, it may seem to do so, but this misconception is illustrative of the divide between reality and perception. Parasite, even if watched as an ideologically vacant film is still incredibly deep, with well-placed reincorporation and a constantly evolving plot.

There's\"Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films\" - Bong Joon Ho. Every piece of this genre bending film is meticulously and masterfully crafted. I am absolutely blown away. There's a quality about certain films where, from the first scene, you can tell there's one strong artistic vision behind it. And in film, this is, of course, called direction. The direction behind Parasite is undoubtedly what made it my new favorite film of 2019. Breaking down the qualities of this film in order of appearance, Parasite is shot with real personality. A steady and practiced hand behind the camera adds one extra layer of emotion to every scene, almost treating the frame as if its the vision of an intangible observer. Focus tracks through this film in that manner with absolute precision and in doing so creates an urgency where there otherwise might not have been. The score of Parasite has a John Williams (almost Home Alone) style at its core with layers thrown on top of it to address the actions in each plot point nearly beat for beat. This is more challenging than it sounds due to the winding and weaving plot the film. I won't write much on the plot as it's best experienced with no preconceptions, but I will say that if you're a plot guesser when you watch movies, you are SOL with this one. On top of all of this, the performances rise to the same level of expertise. The actor playing each character undeniably brings their roles' multi-faceted natures to light over the course of the runtime. The script is the foundation for this, but you can really feel the personality of the direction of this film shining through every performance.

And I won't ever regret it.\"Parasite\", directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a perfect mix of black comedy, thriller, drama and social critic. It just has everything. The title is also magnificent. It makes you think that you'll see South Korea battling against \"coronavirus\" but no; you'll watch a capturing movie where the word \"parasite\" will recieve another deep meaning: the way poor people are seen by the rich class and how someone opposed to you is a kind of virus inside your house; something that doesn't fit in, that does not belong here nor isn't welcomed.This film is, by far, a must-see for cinema lovers since it has all factors that make a movie perfect.

The film is more or less divided into two major sections:the first half of the film follows a Family living in the poor areas of Seoul (im assuming). After the son Ki-Woo (Choi Woo-shik)is given the opportunity to work as an English tutor in an extremely rich household, he begins to realize that despite having a great income, the adults of the family are not exactly the brightest of induviduals, and so slowly Ki-Woo and his family devise a plan to all come into the employment of their new wealthy acquaintances. Although the film may give a lighthearted impression, once the movie transitions into the second half it becomes extraordinarily twisted, slightly resembling the ending of Robert Eggers's 'The Lighthouse'.After contemplating the events that took place witin the film, It seems obvious to me that Like JB Priestley's 'An Inspector Calls', Bong Joon-ho intends for this movie to display a clear contast between the lives of the rich and the struggles of the poor within this obviously unjust society. Of course it doesn't just rub your face with morals, and there is a very substantial and entertaining plot, but this is one of the main focuses of the movie.As for the other, i'd say that would be the excellent dynamic between characters which is further developed by the brilliant performances from every cast member, particularly Park So-dam who in my opinion was robbed of a Best supporting actress nomination. Other notable features include some top of the line cinematography and a outstanding writing, but other than that I feel there isn't much to talk about.Parasite is an absolute masterpiece, and like so many other films that have come out recently I absolutely recommend it.Fun fact: Elon Musk officially stated that Parasite was his favorite movie of 2019, and whie that's all well and good, the film practically exists to ridicule people like him.\u2026 Expand", "score": "9"}, {"date": "Mar  3, 2020", "text": "I was very surprised that this film won the Oscar for Best Film.

Most of the time the visual aspects are installed to enhance the theme of class division. The editing of this film took Parasite to levels even further than already discussed. The flawless editing helped the pace of the movie feel flawless, and it enhanced the thrilling vibe that this movie gives off.The actors in this film ground this realistic yet crazy concept of a film in reality. Without their terrific chemistry and performances, I am not sure that the film would've resonated with as many people as it did. Parasite is a beautiful ride of a movie that transcends any other film experience I've ever encountered. Parasite has invented a new genre of film that just doesn't have a name yet. It's message on how there is a parasitic relationship across classes has been relevant for centuries and will always be relevant. Because of this, the pure thrill of entertainment the movie provides, and the technical craftmanship of this film, I believe Parasite will become a film that will be recognized worldwide as one of the greatest achievements in cinema.

What is certain is that it's exceptional in just about every way \u2013 screenplay (co-written by director Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, mise en sc\u00e8ne, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things \u2013 it lives up to the hype.The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment eking out a meagre living folding pizza boxes. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo bluffs his way into working as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park family. Father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) welcome Ki-woo into their home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families.As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as Parasite is, it remains an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. This is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic and acerbic, but so too compassionate and witty. One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is his avoidance of the clich\u00e9s one so often finds in films dealing with economics \u2013 the Kims are by no means a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels.Bong is uninterested in trucking in heroes and villains because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, whilst the Parks' greatest crime is allowing their wealth to insulate them from the world of families such as the Kims. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims often occupy the same frame, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. Important here is the title. A simple reading is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, Bong depicts the Parks as parasitic as well, feeding off of the labour of their servants. Just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what is a symbiotic relationship.Aesthetically, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb Beoning (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks' house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' cluttered and dilapidated apartment contrasted with the Parks' pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house.It's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found. As a story at least partly in the tradition of the \"upstairs/downstairs\" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below by using stairways as a recurring motif. The Kims' apartment has no stairs, indicating their inability to rise socio-economically. On the other hand, the Parks' home has two stairways \u2013 one going up to the bedrooms where the four children spend an increasing amount of time, cut off from their parents, and one going down into the cellar. Bong shoots this stairway like he's suddenly directing a horror film, bestowing upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing.Parasite is a masterpiece, with Bong never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie \u2013 a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich \u2013 but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy and so on.

The basement of the rich home also houses a poor Man who is separated from them by multiple flights of stairs. The poor people\u2019s homes are flooded by the literal waste of the rich homes. As the Ki family physically gets higher and higher, their social status does too. The higher they go the more their personalities change also. They end up fighting a family who is in a very similar situation to them. The members of the Ki family have changed their personalities so much they now act like they are rich and threaten to call the police on them. The film tries to show how wealth changes people and does it very well. Just like the title implies, having wealth is like a parasite that grows and grows once it gets it grip on someone. The Ki family his ok with pushing other families down as long as it means they stay comfortable in their newly gained wealth.The film also does a great job of illustrating how the rage in Mr. Kim grows throughout the film. The rich family says they hate the smell of him and essentially poor people as a whole. They say they smell like the subway. Then as Mr. Kim returns to work after having his home flooded by the rainfall, the rich mother says that the rain was a blessing and that it made for such a great day. Then Mr. Park reminds Mr. Kim that he is being paid and is an employee not a friend. The final straw comes when Mr. Park holds his nose when he gets near Mr. Kim while trying to retrieve his keys.

It\u2019s even rarer for a foreign film to earn Academy Awards nominations for Best Foreign Language (now called International) film and Best Picture, but Parasite has managed to join this exclusive club. Director Bong Joon-ho has long been turning out top quality, intriguing work (I\u2019m a big fan of his melancholy 2003 film Memories of Murder, about a years long hunt for a serial killer). Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won\u2019s Oscar nominated original screenplay switches tones and even genres so abruptly and successfully, it makes Parasite a unique movie to say the least. Combined with a stellar cast, excellent cinematography, production design, and pacing, Parasite becomes a thoroughly engrossing, extraordinary experience. Movies like this in any language are rare indeed.Parasite begins as a dark comedy and sharp satire about economic inequality and class disparity. The Kim family lives in a shabby basement apartment. The street level window provides them a view of ankles and urinating drunks. They work short term odd jobs and hunt around their apartment for a spot with Wi-Fi. A change in luck comes when a friend of their teenage son recommends him as a tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. The son, Ki-woo, reluctantly accepts though he is under qualified. Soon the Kim family schemes to replace each of the Park family servants with themselves though they pose under false identities. The 20-ish Kim daughter, Ki-jeong, provides the family with false credentials. Things take a fateful and irreversible turn when the Kims decide to have a night in luxury while the Parks are away for the weekend.That plot description seems to make the title describe the Kim family. As you watch them work their way into the home of the Park family, you may find the title applies more to the Parks whose lifestyle requires people like the Kims. The differences between a family that is oblivious of their wealth and a family that schemes to get stable, working-class jobs is apparent. But then, the film reveals layers and depth that make it truly profound. When the film becomes a riveting thriller, it does not eschew its themes and substance. I cannot recall the last time I had no idea where a film was going, not because of incompetence, but because I was watching the work of a master filmmaker.The entire ensemble is terrific. Each role is well cast and there\u2019s a great chemistry between the members of the respective families. The stand outs for me, however are Song Kang-ho as the Kim family patriarch and Park So-dam as his clever daughter. Cho Yeo-jeong as the daffy and gullible Park matriarch is great comic relief.What sets Parasite a step above other socially conscious films is it does not sacrifice entertainment for the sake its social commentary or vice versa. It never pontificates or pretends to have any didactic solution. It is like a classic Twilight Zone episode, up front about its themes but in such a way that doesn\u2019t speak down to audience and feels detached and immediate simultaneously. There is not a single pandering moment in the entire film. Parasite uses the real problems and concerns of modern society to tell a compelling and universal story that causes us to reflect on our world.

Bleak, violent, a dark and twisted story that will constantly keep you guessing.Director and writer Bong Joon Ho has truly outdone himself with this masterpiece. Parasite is one of those rare films you can't stop thinking about after you leave the cinema. It's so profoundly disturbing and bizarre I'm still trying to process it. I understand not everyone takes the time to see subtitled films and to them I can only say you honestly don't know what you're missing.

As the camera settles on this view, HangulBong Joon Ho\u2019s 2019 release opens with a sub-ground level view out of a semi-basement window outlooking the alleyway of a Korean slum that will play the setting for most of the first act of the film. As the camera settles on this view, Hangul characters discreetly faze into frame and are quickly translated to the American title: Parasite. This seemingly menacing title (for who has any good memories of a parasite?) is in stark contrast to the equally seemingly innocuous backdrop. This opening frame acts as the films first (of many) contradictions that keeps the viewer intrigued and constantly guessing what will happen next all the way up to its thrilling and touching finale.\tThe film centers around the Kim family: a hard-on-their luck family existing (just barely) amongst the previously mentioned alleyways of the slums that make up the bedrock of this unnamed Korean metropolitan. The family is shown as goofy, well-meaning, cheap, and ultimately entirely relatable. The interesting characters are brought to life by the apparently impeccable talents of the entire main cast. Kang-ho Song acts as patriarch to the Kim family but never acts as the boss. Each family member has a strength to balance any apparent weaknesses they may have. The performances are broad yet nuanced and the dialogue reaches every emotion on the spectrum while always maintaining a hint of comedy. Every character is given a chance to pine as well as get a laugh. If the trailers and posters scare or baffle you, know this: the acting in this movie is worth the cost of admission on its own. The cinematography and writing are all icing on this character-driven cake.\tThat\u2019s not to say the look and writing of this film are not high points on their own. American viewers will automatically find the Korean setting to be a breath of fresh air with great shots of modern architecture contrasting the dreary shambles of the slums. In every frame of the film, the filmmaker attempts to make the background just as important a character as the people delivering lines. And as the viewers become more accustomed to the diverse settings, the plot constantly creates doubt in our securities and hints at something sinister behind every corner. At the moment you feel most safe, Bong introduces something new that shakes and upturns every notion you built up to that point. This all culminates in a showdown that both strips the viewer of all safety while at the same time establishes a new hope. Walking into the cinema as this film begins, the viewer has a pretty good idea of what kind of film they are in for. But as each scene shifts and every conversation is had in the film, the viewer is treated to something completely new and equally satisfying. The viewer will laugh and cry, cheer and gasp, all while cringing and gripping their seats and this is not an experience offered often to a modern audience. In an age of paint-by-numbers blockbusters, this gem offers a shining example of how great storytelling can be different and completely unsafe.

The only other movie I've seen from Bong is Snowpiercer, a film that dealt with the issues of class inequality, in Parasite he returns to this theme, but this time he plays it from a very realistic angle. Bong captures the tension of class disparity superbly, blending grittiness, humour and horror, and striking imagery that completely immerses you in the world he created. The actors all do a superb job, especially Kang Ho-Song, who best exemplifies through his performance, what it feels like to be on the less-fortunate end of the class spectrum. The writing is superb too, in particular how it portrays the struggle to move up the class ladder, using both the optimistic practicality of \"planning\" and pessimistic impracticality of \"dreaming\", in a hard-hitting way. This movie forces you to ride the wave with our main characters, all the way up, and down.The cinematography is beautiful, and the images composed superbly. The way the cinematography captures the architecture of our more-fortunate characters home is breathtaking, so is their lifestyle. No wonder our main characters plot and dream of being in that position, who wouldn't want to be?. The score stands out too.

In his earlier films \u201cOkja\u201d (2017) and \u201cSnowpiercer\u201d (2013), Bong used a platform of science fiction to soften the message.  With \u201cParasite,\u201d he employs slapstick and dark humor to leaven a story that, in lesser hands, might have become painfully didactic.Setting his story in Seoul, Bong has the benefit of dealing with class warfare and economic inequality without the complication of race.  South Korea is one of the most ethnically homogeneous countries in the world \u2013 96% of the population is Korean.Bong\u2019s pacing of his story is impeccable.  In Act One, we are introduced to the Kim family, literally and figuratively living in the lower reaches of the city, the parents unemployed and struggling, the kids getting by on street smarts.  When workers come by spraying white clouds of pesticide in their rodent-infested section of the city, the father advises to leave the windows open:  \u201cIt\u2019s free extermination.\u201d  At the other end of the economic spectrum is the Park family, wealthy beyond reason and totally reliant on others to do anything requiring physical or mental heavy lifting.  Bong underlines his premise by conveying clearly that, while they have great wealth, the Parks are not endowed with a particularly high level of intelligence, common sense or self-awareness.When a wealthy friend of the Kim son creates an opportunity for him to tutor the Park daughter, the Kims use this entry point as leverage, creating jobs for every member of the family within the Park household.  So far, the story, is light, bright and slapstick, with only a small vein of dark humor.  This tone offers opportunities for non-threatening exposition.  Remarking on the Parks\u2019 unlined faces, Mr. Kim intones: \u201cMoney is like an iron.  It smooths the creases out.\u201dIn Act Two, the story takes a darker turn, initially by exploring the consequences of the Kims\u2019 actions on one of the displaced workers.  By the end of the film, class warfare has escalated from bland observations (Mr. Park observes that those who ride on the subway have a \u201cspecial smell\u201d) to full-on emotional and physical violence.  For me, Bong\u2019s thoughtful, subtly-crafted story invoked a fair amount of thought and introspection.\u201cParasite\u201d won the top prize at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival and is South Korea\u2019s entry for Best International Feature Film at the Oscars.

One thing I do know is certain though, this is such an interesting and unbelievable film in virtually every way possible! Winner of the Palme d'Or (the French equivalent of an Academy Award) earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, this film follows a poor Korean family that attempts to insert themselves into the lives of a rich, upper-class suburban family by getting themselves hired for various jobs for the family, such as a math tudor, chauffeur, cook, etc. They seem intent on even replacing the family and claiming the house for themselves if possible, until they stumble upon something shocking and unexpected within the house. And to say too much else beyond that would ruin the amazing experience of viewing this film for the first time!

Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film\u2019s slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film\u2019s story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It\u2019s so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it\u2019s always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I\u2019m using the word tension a lot but that\u2019s what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced.

Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) who is the son has a college friend called Min (Seo-joon Park) who visits his home and leaves the family a large rock that Min states will bestow wealth upon the family. Min tells Ki-woo that he is going abroad for study and asks him whether he would like to take over as English tutor for this young rich girl he has been tutoring himself. Ki-woo unsure of how he could considering he is not in college nor an english teacher is told by Min that his knowledge is better than most of his college friends and for him not to worry. Ki-woo is hired by the girl's mother Yeon-kyo Park (Yeo-jeong Jo) after he displays his ability to the mother, and this sets in motion a film that offers such varying emotions and surprises throughout that only a few directors of a very able nature could direct a film of this standard. A fantastic ensemble performance with I think particular praise going to Kang-ho Song as Ki-taek Kim the father. His transitions from comedy to drama are seamless as is the film itself and this blend of comedy and drama always lends a hand in making a film great when it is done well as it is in this case. The cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong was perfect and you can tell when you have an ensemble crew who are masters of their field. It is good to see an East Asian film garnering so much attention and awards buzz.\u2026 Expand", "score": "10"}, {"date": "Oct 16, 2019", "text": "Here it is.My favorite movie from Asian cinema this year.Good Acting,good script and a good directing...

I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.I admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it.The movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.The performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.I highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.Overall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air.
