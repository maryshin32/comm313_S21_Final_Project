It is a monster movie -- about a truck-sized mutant that crawls out of the Han River and unleashes terror upon the citizens of Seoul -- and yet, it is not one. Part of The Host's appeal is that its core concerns are somewhat slippery, and hard to pinpoint.\n\nYou could just as well call The Host a family movie. Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong) is the owner of a small food stand in the Han River Citizen's Park, selling squid, candy and beer to people who have come out to enjoy the sun. Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) is one of his three children, a man who seems a bit slow mentally and whose one motivating strength is a devotion to his schoolage daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung). Rounding out the family is Nam-joo (Bae Doona), an amateur competitive archer and her brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il), a former student radical who at present is drunk and unemployed. There are no mothers in the family -- Hee-bong's wife having passed on and Gang-du's having run away. It's a dysfunctional group, held together only by the crisis that faces them, and yet the family dynamics will feel familiar to many viewers.\n\nIt is when the creature snatches the young Hyun-seo that the family becomes aligned against this unknown biological threat. However, in what is perhaps a telling reflection of our times, the family ends up spending more time battling health professionals, military personnel, and other manifestations of the government than the beast itself. The Host mixes more than a few political barbs into its genre cocktail: a bit of SARS here, a bit of Iraq there. Yet it's with a black sense of playfulness and absurdity that these satirical quips are delivered to the audience, suggesting that the film's chief concerns lie elsewhere.\n\nThe monster itself is not a force of pre-meditated evil, bent on destroying civilization. (In this sense it is more Katrina than 9/11) Like any other natural disaster, this clever, ugly, lethal, clumsy, and at times ridiculous monster does what it does simply because it is part of its nature. It eats humans because it is hungry, and because it enjoys it. So in some ways it's hard to see The Host as a contest between good and evil. From a moral viewpoint (but not an emotional one) the film resembles wildlife videos of lions taking down gazelles.\n\nYet in the course of the showdown with the beast, there's a very human sense of loneliness that seeps into the film. Part of it comes from the realization that, in a crisis, one's country may be of no help -- or indeed, may turn against you. A disaster that rips through the fabric of society may reveal that the laws, conventions and beliefs that keep us civilized lie only on the surface. Perhaps the other source of the film's sadness is reflected in a startling line delivered by Byun Hee-bong at the story's mid-point: \"Have you ever smelled it? The stomach of a parent who's lost a child... Once it goes rotten, the smell can travel for miles...\" The family unit at the center of The Host faces the prospect of losing a girl who is dearer to them than anything else, and this too pushes them up against the cruel, arbitrary forces that shape our lives.\n\nThe Host is more of a spectacle film, a sensual burst of inspiration that picks us up and carries us along on a harrowing ride (this must be seen in the theater if at all possible). It is perhaps unfair to expect Bong to come up aces two films in a row; but it is surprising is that he came so close to doing just that."}, {"date": "Nov 01, 2009", "score": 3, "text": "This was delightfully fun with the most delicious offbeat humor I have ever seen.

Because this South Korean gem behaves like no monster movie I've ever seen by defying expectations repeatedly.\n\nToxic chemicals were illegally dumped into the Han river, and years later a hideously cool mutant fishy creature wreaks havoc on the nearby city in general, and one family in particular.  Gang-du is a little slow and runs a food stand with his father.  During one ordinary afternoon, the creature emerges suddenly from the river, and in the ensuing chaos Gang-du's daughter Hyun-seo is seized by the beast which plunges back into the water and disappears.  When evidence surfaces that she may still be alive, it's up to Gang-du, his father, his unemployed college-educated brother, and his archery bronze-medalist sister to find her.  Trouble is, Gang-du was exposed to the beast's blood and fear of a lethal virus causes him to be quarantined, so when they escape the medical facility they are all wanted by the police.  \n\nThe family dynamics are really well presented, and part of what makes this movie special is that they don't have all the answers.  In fact, they have very few answers - what would YOU do in similar extraordinary circumstances?  Try your best, that's what, even if it's not the smartest course of action.  These people behave more like real people would, and the trouble they get into and cause for themselves is sometimes a source of humor.  The script is great with lots of little clever touches, like Gang-du saying they should record the TV bulletin of their escape so he could show Hyun-seo after they find her that daddy was on TV, or when Gang-du while pinned to the ground by army doctors keeps repeating the name of the Wonhyo bridge he must find and the doctors discuss the origin of the name while holding his thrashing limbs - \"Wonhyo, wasn't he a saint?\"  \"No, I think he was a monk.\"  The cinematography is also excellent with an artistry rarely seen in the genre, resulting in many memorable sequences, a few of which include the initial monster sighting and then when it runs amok, its unique way of traversing a bridge, the escape attempt by Hyun-seo, and the final confrontation with an unlikely hero - and unanticipated tragedy.\n\n<i>The Host</i> contains trace elements of <i>Mimic, Outbreak, The Crazies,</i> and <i>War of the Worlds</i> but is completely unlike any of those movies, and ultimately superior because of its exhilarating defiance of any formula - in fact, Spielberg could have learned some valuable new storytelling ideas for his <i>WotW</i> remake by emulating this family's bonding in the midst of a catastrophe.

I personally like the design of the monster in this movie granted its no xenomorph (Alien franchise) it's still a pretty awesome monster. The film takes place in Korea where chemicals from a factory are being dumped into a river. The chemicals cause a creature in the river to mutate into a crazy looking monster. The monster attacks a group of people on the beach. during the attack the monster grabs a young girl with it's tail. Her family is heart broken by the loss. The government then concludes that a recent virus has developed that infects anyone who has came in conctact with the monster. The family is then moved to a hospital where anyone who has came into contact with the virus is quarantined. Eventually the family escapes the hospital and tries to rescue the girl which eventually causes death to certain members of the family. \n\nOne of the things that I really liked about the host is the how realistic certain parts of the movie are. The movie portrayed how a family would try to save their daughter very well. The movie also portrayed the family struggles and conflicts with each other very well, with some family members trying to save the girl while others are just trying to believe that she has passed on and that they should focus on moving on with their lives. I give a thumbs up for the acting in this movie everyone had good performances, just good acting all around. \n\nI also think the movie has a deeper meaning that we should stop polluting earth. Before our laziness to save earth causes destruction. The film pretty much uses a ridiculous scenario to make a finer point. The point of that being to stop polluting earth the scenario being the pollution causing the creation of a hideous monster. Or It could just be a good monster movie. It really just depends on what the viewer thinks. \n\nOverall a very good monster movie and also a great foreign film.

When I saw this film a few weeks ago I was expecting a really awesome monster film. The problem with expecting that is that the film really isn't a monster movie. There are too many things going on at once and there are way too many storylines none of which are executed all that well. The film works to an extent but I was fairly unimpressed and for the most part pretty unhappy with my viewing of the film. \n\nThe main reason why the film is still fresh though is because the first thirty minutes of the film is awesome. When the monster first appears you're really surprised at how awesome it looks and the first big monster chase scene was pretty amazing and full of tension. The problem with that is though is that it's the best part of the film. A film will always fall apart when the film has it's best moment thirty minutes into the film. The film from there pretty much stays alive because they are searching for Park's captured daughter. His family is very worried about her and they begin a search. The search for her and all of the parts of that were pretty great. When the family meets up with the monster that has took there relative there is a deep sense of greatness. The showdown between the family and the monster is great. For the first hour of this film I was really digging what I was seeing. The next few moments in the film though pretty much completely brought me out of the film.\n\nThe Government testing and all of the requisites of those scenes was just boring and dull. They end up capturing all those who have had contact with the monster and quarantining them. The scenes where they have been quarantined is just boring. I hated that part of the film because we knew they were going to escape the facility and fight the monster yet we stay there for nearly 45 minutes and do nothing. I may not get the deeper meaning of the film but it's a monster movie is it supposed to have one. I would have much preferred just an all out assault on this monster like in the first hour. The second hour of the film feels like a completely different movie. I didn't really relate to any of the characters and there are problems with the acting. There were some performances that I bought but a lot of the performances just fell completely flat. \n\nThe climax of the film was enough to save it from a rotten rating though, but for the most part the film doesn't do anything all that radical or different from what I've seen. 28 Days Later takes a similar plot but with Zombies and does a 10 times better job. The film just feels like two different episodes and there is nothing of note in the second except for the climax. The climax is good enough to warrant watching but for the most part I didn't like the film. I appreciated the way it was filmed and made and the fact that the CGI didn't look fake but I had a lot of problems with this film and I don't think I'll be watching it again anytime soon. It's just really frustrating because the first half I loved and I hated the second half and it makes for just a decent film. This film could have been so much more than what it is and as it stands right now, it's not one of the better horror/monster films I've ever seen which some critics make it out to be. Just good enough for fresh but just frustrating because it could have been amazing. 60/100[img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/statusicon/forum_new.gif[/img]."}, {"date": "Apr 15, 2009", "score": 5, "text": "wow umn this is a freaky movie 2 watch...i have just seen this movie 4 the 1st time n think that this is just freaky movie but its a good movie 2 watch...its got a good cast of actors/actressess throughout this movie...i think that ah-sungko, hae-il park, du-na bae play good parts throughout this movie..i think that the director of this Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Drama, Comedy movie had done a good job of directing this movie because you never know what 2 expect throughout this movie its a freaky movie 2 watch but its really good/enjoyable movie 2 watch..its got some good special effects throughout this movie its a good movie"}, {"date": "Apr 14, 2009", "score": 2.5, "text": "If when it burps bones came up its mouth.. what would of happend when it farts??

Maybe the 'hype' machine had too much influence on me, but I think because it breaks the blueprint slightly and is in essence more a drama than a creature-feature means that it doesn't quite reach such stellar company and unfortunately is it's own victim in that sense, because while it is a good film, it holds little to offer on repeat viewings because it won't let you settle into a specific mood. Director Bong Joon-Ho probably summed it up best himself when he said that it is less a monster movie and more a film about a kidnapping, where the kidnapper just happens to be a mutant amphibian.\r\n\r\nStripped to it's core, The Host is about the importance of family bond and that that bond can and does shine through during crisis. An already struggling unit, our family - the Parks - must deal with the unthinkable: The youngest and brightest spark in their clan has been taken, presumed dead, not by man, but by something that just shouldn't exist. Joon-Ho sets up this idea nicely by having the creature born from nature - and of human interference no less, as opposed to something supernatural or otherworldly. The grounding of the movie in a recognisable family reality is probably it's greatest strength. Like the Park family, you just accept what happens and deal, and in the end, it's not that much of a stretch.\r\n\r\nVarious arguments surrounding the reveal of the monster I found slightly tenuous because for all it's refreshing glee, the scene in the park - indeed, the monster itself - is merely the catalyst for the main idea and besides, when your creature design is this cool, why not show it off more? I actually praise Joon-Hu for being so subtle and almost blas\u00e9 in his approach with this jaw dropping moment. It's superbly pleasing that not 20 minutes into The Host, we see a full shot of the creature diving into the river while curious gawkers scratch their heads leading into a fantastic directed sequence where our slippery beastie asserts his need for breakfast. Yes, the best bit with the monster (but certainly not the last) is done less than half an hour into the film, but like I said, this isn't Jaws or The Thing, so being patient is rewarding in different ways here.\r\n\r\nTo it's credit, The Host still belongs in the same category as the above mentioned films because like them, it's strengths lie in it's ability to create a human situation around the monster that's both compelling and interesting. It just doesn't do it nearly as well as Spielberg's blockbuster or Carpenter's paranoia masterwork and unfortunately suffers slightly from the same old clich\u00e9s as well as being a tad too long. . In the end, it's still a must see for it's striking cinematography, original creature design, interesting performances which include some great borderline slapstick comedy and a not so flattering portrayal of the US government.\r\n\r\nThe slight identity-crisis-suffering screenplay does lead you astray at times, but it's definitely above your average Hollywood blockbuster, and even though being Korean might make it cooler; it doesn't necessarily make it that much different.

Last year I had heard a bunch of stuff about it but I'm not one who's personally into the Asian cinema. At first glance I just figured this was another dumb monster movie like Cloverfield. But then I watched it and I found this film much more entertaining and had a better plot in general then that other American monster movie.\nAt the very core of the film it is a drama about a father and his family trying to find his young daughter. So really it's sorta a family drama but just add a crazy water monster to the mix. And speaking of the monster I'm still not sure if I as an audience member am suppose to know just what this thing originally mutated from, or what the heck it is in general? At least I know how it came to be and it wasn't this big thing covered in mystery throught the film. No, it the first few minutes of the movie the audience is told how this thing came to be and you get a big close-up look at at as well. I still don't understand why you wouldn't want to hide a big ass monster from the audience when the thing is huge to begin with, it just doesn't make sense to me?\nAnyways, I now see why their was a bunch of buzz for this film and I would totally recommend it to those who are fans of the monster movie genera. I found it much better then Cloverfield and the storyline was more entertaining and it snuck in a few political points as well at the end. The only negative thing I could say about it was that I wasn't that impressed with the monster itself, you could tell it was CGI and I think maybe with a bigger buget or more work put into the monster itself it could have looked more real. Other then that I think it was a really good movie that is fine just the way it is and I would prefer that America doesn't try and fuck it up by doing a remake of it cause we all know that it won't come even close.\n [/left]\n [size=5] [img]http://media.movieweb.com/img/G/H/E/PHDegKEGdHsGHE_m.jpg[/img]\n  [/size][/center]"}, {"date": "Dec 07, 2008", "score": 3.5, "text": "Joon-ho Bong makes his version of a b-movie monster mash, but with a-list production quality and of course a uniquely Korean sense of humour."}, {"date": "Dec 06, 2008", "score": 4.5, "text": "It saddens me to say but this is the last film in my international film course, and it was a good one.

Putting aside the obvious Vietnam parallel to be drawn, it's no mistake that the container holding the Agent Yellow looks exactly like Steve when we first get a real glimpse of him, hanging off a bridge, unassuming yet menacing. Because, on one of the many levels this films succeeds, Gwoemul uses this image to present a viciously unflattering, critical look at the American foreign policy of 'intervention' \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is, going into countries and forcing the country's dependence on the US, all under the basis of helping them in times of need. Bong runs a scalpel through the body of US interventionism and South Korea's rolling over to accept it, and presents the US as weak-minded, obnoxious, ethically dubious monsters, culminating in this garish yellow piece of symbology.  \n\nBut Gwoemul isn't just anti-US polemic, delivered with subtlety that fluctuates between razor-sharp (the aforementioned Agent Yellow receptacle; the brave Captain Obvious, Sergeant Donald) to sledgehammer-blunt (Wilson's cameo at the start as a fuck-the-rules-type mortician, the cross-eyed American doctor in the middle). It's also a bittersweet family tale, and an utter ripsnorter of a monster film. Following innocent buffoon Gang-du (Song), his father Hie-bong (Byeon), his drunk and unemployed activist brother Nam-il (Park), and his slow and hesitant medal-winning archer sister Nam-Joo (Bae), as they try to find sardonic young Hyun-seo (Ko), who's stuck in a sewer somewhere, stored away for Steve's num-nums, Bong and the actors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Song proving his rising star again, with a character rather different to that in Salinui choek (Memories of Murder), but the shining stars being Ko, who puts in one of the best child performances I've seen, and Byeon, great as the straight man in a gang of misfits \u00e2\u0080\u0093 paint a picture of a likeable family who have the bad luck of being both dysfunctional and incredibly flawed. They may not necessarily be your normal family, but Bong's characterisation of them makes them feel normal \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the scenes in the food cart, as they shack up for the night while trying to find Hyung-seo, are great examples of this. You feel for their plight as they try, doggedly, against the will of pretty much everyone else, and even against the will of their own competence, to find Hyung-seo in the 'infected' Han River Section.  \n\nAnd, as stated before, Gwoemul is a cracking monster movie, mainly through the magnificent realisation of our friend, Steve. Bong wastes no time revealing this grotesque formaldehyde-induced monstrosity (designed by Weta Workshops \u00e2\u0080\u0093 NZ represent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and animated by acclaimed San Francisco sfx unit The Orphanage), and the opening sequence, with him laying waste to the riverside, is breathtaking, a stunning mix of camerawork, music, acting (even with our dear friend Donald, played by an overzealous American actor \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as they tend to be in Korean productions) and special effects to make this oversized tadpole a truly vicious creature, something to be feared. Every time Steve is on screen, everything kicks up a notch and it's a non-stop ride while he's there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 every frame drips with tension, every beat with dread. And while he may not get the best send-off, in a Scorpion King-esque failure of special effects, that doesn't change the fact that Gwoemul is still a cerebral, moving, touching, and pulse-pounding monster film that is the best example of the genre I've seen."}, {"date": "Nov 23, 2008", "score": 4, "text": "Great monster movie with lots of laughs too."}, {"date": "Nov 22, 2008", "score": 3.5, "text": "Very good monster movie.

The film goes from humor to sadness without giving a warning, going back and forth between the two emotions like night and day. It seems to be asking us to recognize how serious and damaging we can be in our decisions and what we can turn into because of them.\r\n\r\nIt seems America is the monster that infected Koreans waters causing birth defects in the next generation. Families that could have been strong were made victims to this poor decision. A U.S. official orders the dumping of Formaldehyde in the sewer system of a Korean city. This is the action that created the Urban Legend of the sea creature, a slithering, gobbling, ugly, frightening, and most disgusting 30 foot tad pole.\r\n\r\nThe direction is beautiful. The film dwells in the sewer systems as a family searches for their little girl. The scenes with the monster are gripping especially with the little girl hiding in a hole, alone, hungry, but spiritually strong. The film has an unfamiliar tone with it's approach on telling it's tale. It's ability to take the mood from light to dark is affecting. Once the parable comes to life as we witness that we lie in the belly of the beast that is destroying the world, that we created this monster for usury, that is when the film truly becomes effecting. The monster consumes everything without need for it. Consumerism has infected the individual and is destroying everything in it's path for progress in the Age of Invention. The power of a family is destroyed by it.\r\n\r\nA strange and beautiful film"}, {"date": "Sep 29, 2008", "score": 4, "text": "The Host is a wonderful blend of comedy, drama, and a motherfucking monster on the loose!

Now, when I hear about a foreign film I might be interested in, I will now strongly consider it. \"The Host\" is one that I heard about a while back, but didn't check out until now. \"The Host\" is a Korean film with a mixture of \"Godzilla\" themes and \"Jaws\". The title refers to a mutant creature created when a laboratory worker dumps large amounts of chemicals into the sink, which ends up in the Han River. An amphibian creature later shows up and begins to wreak havoc on the community. Set against the chaos is a simple family whose daughter is snatched by the creature and presumed to be dead. When her father receives a cell phone call from her, it becomes their quest to find her and save her from the creature. The film also delves into the \"culture of fear\" that governments create to keep its people in line when the government rounds up anyone who has been \"exposed\" to the creature under the guise that the creature is a \"host\" for a very lethal virus. The effects and story line were great in this film. The acting was a bit over the top, but I am not sure if that was worsened by the voice actors who did the dubbing for the English language track. I actually recommend that you watch this in the original language with subtitles. It was a fun ride, while still fitting in some compelling social commentary and an examination of the dynamics of a family. There is one great soliloquy from the patriarch of the family as he explains to two of his kids that they cannot imagine the anguish of their brother, who has lost his daughter. An emotional appeal, and one that hit home for me. I found this to be an entertaning two hours.\n\nGrade: B-"}, {"date": "Aug 01, 2008", "score": 3.5, "text": "Campy, but extremely fun.

The creature is not hidden as it first attacks, it doesn't pop out of nowhere, it gains just as much shock from the audience as it would from those two devices by presenting in in an almost nonchalant, docile way as we see it first with the perspective of a group of people who are in complete disbelief of what they're about to experience. However, though the creature attacks and kills, the havoc it directly wreaks is not the focus of the film. The film hones in on a single family's journey to seek out the mutation and rescue the youngest of the family, who is still alive in the creature's makeshift pit of doom, a sewer hole. We come to know this family much better with much more interesting and original backstories than, say, the family in Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow. There is a lot of odd internal conflict and unraveling that happens, and nothing we expect as an American audience can truly be expected, or unexpected.\n\nSomething quite interesting about this film that a lot of directors of any nationality would have a hard time doing. This film is a monster film, a disaster film, and yet when a young girl is carried off in the first fifteen minutes by the creature, the next thing we see is the family crying in an overelaborate, blown up, melodramatic way, rolling on the floor, screaming, wiggling, creating an amoeba of bodies squirming and such, in a way that is actually played for laughs. Most films can hardly get a rise out of your average audience by making light of a small child's peril, and this film not only does just that but also completely maintains its tone as a monster thriller.\n\nSomething I find relieving, as an American in this time of political hell, is this film's seemingly subtle characterization of everything American that is involved in it. The film opens with a condescending, closed-minded American chemist working in South Korea ordering his Korean assistant, with complete ignorance to to the assistant's objections and reasoning, to dump dozens upon dozens of leftover bottles of formaldehyde and other toxic chemicals into the Han River. Hence, the creature. There are several more increasingly barefaced instances throughout the film. The Cincinnati Enquirer made a beef about this, being quite a slanted and Conservative newspaper, and I never thought that its complaint, despite its otherwise positive notice of the film, would be credible. To my surprise, it was, but I find it endearing, especially at the height of the Bush administration's thundering wrath upon the world.\n\nHowever, this is not intended to make heroes out of Koreans. For people who kill and abuse animals indiscriminately, have no laws against authentic animal abuse and deaths in movies and TV, and see animals as nothing more than objects, I don't see how they're justified as the particular country that should be making films antagonizing us for contaminating waters. Having had terrible experiences with animal deaths in Korean films, despite how immensely good they tend to be, I checked thoroughly on www.kids-in-mind.com for the content of this movie to be sure that no animals are harmed in any way, and there are none. However, even still, there is a character who says, \"Old people say that if an animal kills a human, that animal deserves to be torn limb from limb.\" The logic behind this is ridiculous, animals killing entirely out of defense or natural predatory tendencies, and human beings killing them for not only those reasons but also profit and lack of consideration or respect. I find myself sympathizing in a way with the creature itself, a fish that has mutated into a giant carnivorous monster. I know that most people that read this review will think of me as a whining bleeding heart, but can you say I'm wrong? Really, think about how I could possibly not have a point to ponder.\n\nLike most Korean films, there is fantastic cinematography. The Host is a joy to look at it like all of the other Korean films I've seen, yet the special effects are, despite how entertaining they are, a bit noticeably unreal. Godzilla was released in 1998. Nine years later, with all of the progression we've made, we must have some way that we can make creatures more realistic.\n\nOverall, The Host is enormously entertaining. I may have completely changed tones throughout my review, but know that it is only personal peeves of mine that make it only just ever so slightly less than great for me. It's vastly enjoyable."}, {"date": "Jul 08, 2008", "score": 4.5, "text": "THIS MOVIE IS SO GOOD.

Not sure what would have been better, but there's so little focus on the moster of this movie being a host for a possible virus, that I thought perhaps once people were attacked by the monster THEY would then become hosts for new monsters.  Which is always a disgusting plot device, but it works for horror.  \n \nThis is not your average monster movie.  You see the monster by minute 13 according to the director - so not a lot of suspense about what it looks like and what it does.  It is a gorgeous creation by the Weta Workshop out of New Zealand who are responsible for the effects and such in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  It's totally CGI, but it blends flawlessly with reality (ah hem, take notes Mr. Lucas)  And as I read in another review on this site, there is no humanization of this monster - it simply exists to kill & eat.  \n \nWhich leaves the plot to the family of little Hyun-seo who is carried off by the monster in the first 20 minutes of the movie.  As also stated by the director, they are a bunch of losers.  Her father, Gang-du sleeps the day away at his father Hee-bongs food stand.  Her aunt Nam-joo is an aspiring Olympic archer who we see choke and claim a bronze medal in a competition early in the film.  Lastly there is her uncle Nam-il, a frustrated, alcoholic, would-be office worker.  They band together to get Hyun-seo back after she manages to make contact with them after being carried away.  \n \nI was not particularly in the mood for a \"monster\" movie when we sat down to watch this.  Exacerbating my feelings was the just God-awful dub.  I'm begging you - do not watch this with the dub on.  Switch to Korean and read the subs.  The dub makes the actors sound ridiculous and makes the movie lose all poignancy.  As in all Asian movies, there is a fair bit of overacting, but the dub makes it that much more unbearable.  \n \nI did not think I would like this movie and I was a bit annoyed at it while watching it.  One of my major problems with it aside from the dub is how time elapses in the story.  It is impossible to tell if events are happening over a few days or a few hours.  However, when it started heading toward it's finale (and it drags a bit in the middle, so regardless of the dub or sub, be warned) I realized I had become invested in the characters and genuinely wanted to find out what happened to them.  \n \nThis movie is more a family drama that contains a monster than monster movie.  It also contains a fair bit of politcal commentary in that the director shows how the U.S. is pretty much responsible for the monster's creation and then for the cover-up that follows it's emergence and the possible virus it causes.  So once you get rid of the horrible dubbing, the acting becomes much more believable and in places, heart-breaking.  \n \nIf you are a fan of this genre, you'll probably enjoy this movie a lot.  Frankly I think it contained a better monster than Cloverfield.  The Host broke box office records in its native South Korea, which is a rarity.  Those who enjoy forgein films might like to see how well done a non-Hollywood monster film can be. This is not a movie I would have rented myself, but I did enjoy it.  But for pete's sake, please watch it without the dubbing!!!"}, {"date": "May 20, 2008", "score": 5, "text": "this is what dreams are made of, movie of the century? possibly.  better than all the alien films put together, emo, well acted, great plot.\nkorea 1 rest of the world 0\nps if you dont like this film you not only have no sense or taste, but your eyes deserve to be burnt out with formaldehyde,  or allowed to mutate in their sockets with the use of formaldehyde rendering you fit only for a turn of the century circus freak show."}, {"date": "May 19, 2008", "score": 1.5, "text": "The actors were horrible.

This is an unfair condemnation in the extreme since it is through this genre that new trends and film making styles evolve and Bong Joon-ho 's The Host is a prime example. What is most striking about Bong's film is that it succeeds in mixing political issues of fear-as-control, through a outbreak storyline touching on the SARS outbreak which recently swept through East Asia, with more taditional values of Korean cinema and the same grotesquely comic horror apparent in Evil Dead and Bad Taste.  A big part of the film's success is also down to lead actors Ko Ah-Sung and Park Hae-il, particularly the former whose turn as mentally challenged inadequate father Gang-Du adds some much needed emotion to what would otherwise be percieved as a very cold and clinical film. This becomes particularly relevent in the film's coupling of depression and disaster, with the tragedy of the film's many deaths being accentuated to their maximum level and creating a disassociation of the anarchic irreverent chaos of the monster's first rampage along the Seoul waterfront. However, at the end of the day, The Host is a film conservative text about family and how times of need can be a way to unite them: referenced through the film's ending where Gang-du and his two super intelligent, stuck up siblings finally work as a cohesive unit to bring the beast down when the US funded chemical Agent Yellow (a glorified version of mustard gas) fails to do it's job. It is an attempt to strip away legality and pose the question of what really matters when all is said and done.

Strong performances from the five leads playing the \"Infected Family\", particularly the actors playing Gang-Du, Gang-Du's dad and Hyung-Seo (an amazing performance from the young actress who plays her) and clever writing make the characters so much more well-rounded and more sympathetic, that you actually care what happens to them.

The Host is one of those unique features that really outdoes itself in certain areas, such as genre and allegory.  In fact, the film may be one of the best political allegories I've ever seen.  The film may not be perfect, but they precise wit with which the message is delivered is undeniable, as are the many charms that make The Host shine.\n \n The monster itself is tastefully done.  The initial scene of mayhem where it comes is adrenaline-pumping entertainment, a la Cloverfield (I know, this came out before) and the monster itself keeps the audience interested with a semi-personality and many fantastic scenes.  The CGI is some of the best I've seen, save a few botched scenes towards the end.  Other than that, I couldn't get over how seamless the monster was as he interacted with the population surrounding the Han River.\n \n [img]http://janedark.com/host-2007-2.jpg[/img]\n \n The characters were all so well-developed that any cliche added to their charm.  The story, for the most part, holds together well, though it's obvious that the film holds a more important focus.  I loved the way each family member works together and utilizes individual talents to locate Hyun-Seo.  The genre-bending also works well here, since the film can escape typical traps that would bog any feature of one genre as opposed to a work of many.  The random scenes regarding the virus were also wonderful.\n \n The only issues deal with some segments, in which the aim seems a bit cloudy.  Some of the comedy is very tastefully done; other comedic parts come off as cheesy and questionable.  The Korean slapstick formula is often lost on vacant American audiences (me).  As a whole, The Host works on many levels and hits hard on it's most important - political allegory, however there are a few awkward scenes that keep this film from becoming even greater than it already is.[/size][/font]"}, {"date": "Mar 21, 2008", "score": 4, "text": "Man!

Dangerous chemicals intentionally leaked into the Han River produce a freakish aquatic mutated animal that goes on a rampage, apparently eating a lot of people. Including the daughter of a seemingly slow-witted man, who later receives a call from the girl and becomes convinced that she is still alive. The man and his two adult siblings and father escape from the military authorities that have taken control of the area, and set out to find the girl. \n\nThe Host is an action-packed monster feature, but it's also hilarious and tragic. And occasionally dull, if only for brief periods of time. The inconsistent pacing of the movie was really my only big complaint, and did hurt it some in my eyes. The beginning and ending are strong, but the middle lags a bit. \n\nThe creature itself is incredibly well-designed, which is good because we see a lot of it. It looks more like a living animal than a CGI creation.

It's a Korean Horror/Comedy/Drama about ecological, family, government conspiracy, sacrifice and bioterrorism issues. And it's gotta monster in it, too! Sound confusing? It's really not. The Host simply does what any good movie does and has the situation play out as it would in real life. \n\nOn a nice sunny day, the Parks are enjoying a day of good business at their concession stand near the bank of the river. Out of nowhere, a monster pops out of the river and starts attacking and devouring the citizenry! It's bad enough that Gang-Du can hardly stay awake for 30 minutes, but now his young daughter, Hyun-Seo has been captured by the monster! After escaping from the government's quarantine zone, the Parks have to band together to try to find Hyun-Seo and put an end to this monster's reign of virus-spreading terror! \n\nThe Host is a very humanistic film. I love that it shows the tight bond between the Park family, despite their differences. The regretful father, the unemployed and jaded brother, the Olympic archer sister and of course, the seemingly witless Gang-Du. These four give up their material wealth and personal safety all to fight for the wellbeing of their granddaughter, niece and daughter, respectively and it is touching.\n\nOf course you have the asides of government disrespect for the environment, preying on the populace's fear for alternate purposes and scapegoating in general, too.The citizenry in South Korea must be stronger-willed than that of the US, because the depiction of public protest didn't look forced at all. They smelled the government bullshit on the virus scare and disagreed with the quick fix bio hazard agent release, so they took to the streets. There was a monster to worry about! Quit trying to poison us while there was a REAL threat out there to stop!\n\nThe flick is well acted and looks great. The CG monster is one of the best I've seen in a while and the whole flick isn't so effects heavy that it looks schlocky. There are perfectly picked environments  (sewers, the park, and bridges) for the monster to cavort it and it looks all the better for it. The initial rampage scene is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nThis review is all over the place, I know, but really you should see this one. It's hard to describe The Host, but it is definitely one that will be in my personal collection. It's one of the best pieces of Asian cinema that I've seen for a while and it's got a scary monster in it! C'mon!

Sure, it has action, comedy, drama, political commentary and, of course, a monster, but these labels only give a small indication of what you're in for.  That the highest grossing film in the history of South Korea could also get American critics' panties in a wad speaks both to the universality of its message and the broad appeal of its genre hybridization.\n\nThe film begins when a U.S. military scientist needlessly forces a hapless Korean doctor to pour dozens of formaldehyde bottles down a drain which leads to the Han River in the heart of Seoul.  The fact that they were dumped simply because they have gathered a bit too much dust immediately announces one of the films major themes -- the tendency of governments to overstep their bounds often leads only to shortsighted actions that spiral into uncontrollable destruction.  The monster formed from this act, appearing to be a bizarre mix of a frog and a Tyrannosaurus Rex with the mouth of Predator, terrorizes the nation while the media and military drive everyone into a further frenzy by playing off the paranoia.\n\nWhat at first seems like a postmodern retread of Godzilla becomes far more interesting as it spirals further and further away from its pointed, though simplistic, initial commentary.  While Godzilla, the film, and the monster retained a direct correlation to the fears of the nuclear age, its limited scope prevented it from saying much more than its humanistic message suggested.  That's not to say it was not an effective genre piece, but The Host makes much bolder moves, refusing to equate its monster to any specific real world entity.  Instead, its initial situation is merely a stepping stone to a more damning critique of the atmosphere of paranoia looming over the world in these post-9/11 times.\n\nBridging the gap between the personal and the political nearly as deftly as it shape-shifts from one genre to another, The Host follows the goofy, immature, yet somehow lovable, Gang-du as he tries to rescue his daughter alongside his father, brother and sister.  The odd family dynamic makes for some brilliant comic moments that highlight the film'\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0080\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u0099s more dramatic aspects.  How many films can transform a grieving session into an outright wrestling match and retain its melancholy tone even while you're laughing?  This begins to get at what makes the film so original and effective.  It never loses sight of the seriousness of the situation, even in its most hysterical moments, and the deaths of characters in the film are not simply shrugged off as the hunt continues.  The emotional weight of the monster's destructive acts and the frustrations caused by pointless governmental interference follow the characters throughout the film.\n\nThe absurdity of excessive bureaucracy impeding the rescue of people directly affected by a tragedy immediately conjures up memories of Katrina, but the film remains ambiguous enough to speak to all cultures and the worldwide climate of paranoia created by hype-driven media saturation and overzealous governments.  If it sounds like the film takes its shots at the United States' recent foreign policies, it does, but not without putting a good chunk of the blame on the South Korean government, media, and even the public's misguided notions of protest.  At its core, The Host is about the devaluation of the individual in the face of catastrophe in the modern world.  Not only does everyone, aside from those in danger, overreact, but they do so in a way that continually shifts the concerns away from human suffering and towards an illogical, yet almost universally accepted, fear of the unknown.  While the monster is the catalyst for the tragedy occurring in the film, it is the culture of paranoia that becomes the titular \"host.\"\n\nBefore going too far and making the film sound deadly serious, I should mention how wonderfully it integrates action and surprisingly impressive special effects into the fabric of the film.  Just as its familial drama is enhanced by its perfectly placed comedic touches, so its socio-political commentary is made both more digestible and immediate through its many thrilling action sequences.  It's exciting to see a genre film deal with such complex issues, yet never remain anything less than thoroughly entertaining.  However, unlike the typical monster/disaster film (which I hope I've shown that this is anything but), The Host does not use its commentary as a vehicle for an array of visual effects; instead it places its story, characters and social message first, which fortunately leaves plenty of room for the action and suspense to naturally enter in.  That all of these elements are incredibly well-formed and developed is reason enough for me to call this one of the great films of 2007.  The universality of its message coupled with its effective balance of comedy, drama and action makes me more inclined to say its one of the best films of its genre in recent memory."}, {"date": "Mar 04, 2008", "score": 2.5, "text": "With some notable exceptions, I'm not a big fan of the monster movie.

They had a scene where a man started coughing like crazy and then spit what he had just hacked up into a puddle which a car drives through, splashing tons of people. Really creative idea, but then why on earth did they shoot that scene and then not have the virus play any significant role in the plot? Why stretch out the movie to be so long that it bores your audience if the scenes weren't adding up to anything relevent anyway?\n  \n WHAT I THINK is that the point they were getting at, was that the Avian flu, or Sars, were just government cover-ups, for this creature. I guess they were just killing off witnesses and reporting it to the media as a virus, but that wasn't explained in the movie, that's just me drawing a really far contrived inference.\n    \n    Final thoughts: Cool concept, and cool monster but attrocious execution. I wanted to give the movie a 6 or so, but I also wanted it to be rotten.

That statement is not said lightly.  The only reason I gave it a half star rather than no stars, besides the fact that you can't do that on Facebook, is that the monster was actually pretty awesome looking, kinda like a deformed fish with feet and a Predator mouth.  Anyways here comes the rundown.  A family of retarded Koreans, that was not racist, the family is retarded, run a food stall on the Han River.  One day the beast, made from fish being exposed to formaldehyde, rises from the river, o shit we are all fucked now, run to China.  Anyways the monster steals the main character's daughter who is the smartest individual in the entire movie.  Then there is a huge shit storm of events that take place, including a make pretend virus, as if the government didn't have anything better to do then scare the shit out of the public.  It all ends with the daughter being killed, along with a bunch of Korean hommies.  Then the family of retards kicks the shit out of the monster.  The main character goes all super sayan with his yellow hair of justice and slays that beast with the bo staff of legend.  Respeck to that.  But still, this monster went down so easily, it took a little gasoline, some fire, an arrow in the eye and a bo staff.  No body ever tried to kill this fucker; they were all too concerned with scaring the public with the fear of a virus.  If they went at this monster with what they did to poor little Clover from Cloverfield, the monster wouldn't have lasted long enough for you to refill your popcorn.  All in all a shit covered walnut, but why so popular, you may ask?  Here is my theory.  Some movie critics living in Beverly Hills got bored one day and decided to try an experiment.  Can we brainwash the public?  The answer is obviously yes.  All they had to do was say they liked it, and automatically all the people who can't think for themselves, all of you giving it over 3 stars, believe them and figure it must be good.  Here is some advice.  The screen is on the TV not in your ass, so get your head out of it and watch the movie again.  Learn to think for yourselves and to hate pieces of shit.

Here is the solution.  A Korean film that came out last year, The Host is a fantastic example of a monster movie done right.  A low budget and talented cast give this film all of its charm.  The story centers around the monster and a family who's young daughter is abducted by it.  I found this film actually frightening, and it didnt overuse any gags or steal them from other films, as Cloverfield did.  When you know a character is going to die, then its nice to have that character die in a way you dont expect.  And it makes you care about the characters.  That is the problem with many films of this nature, the characters are just people who serve no purpose but to be gored by the creature.  This film made me worry about its characters and actually had me depressed when certain ones were killed.  It had a very well developed story, about how the monster was the result of abuse of chemicals and is the host of a deadly virus that begins killing off the people who come in contact with it.  Then American scientists come try to capture the monster and the victims to use it as a biological weapon, as the central family tries to find the monster and save their lost daughter.  It is not what you would expect at all; extremely well conceived storyline that has an exciting arc, not 90 minutes focused on a single objective while we scream.  Not without camp, it does have a SINGLE rampage scene.  Not 90 minutes of screaming and destruction, mind you, but a single scene that is over in about 5 minutes, so the films story can move underway.  Also, the film's score is a little quirky.  In some of the more intense scenes it had some strange soundtracks.  Some were very relevant and some kind of confused the mood, but it didnt make the film any less scary.  The monster design was very frightening as well, however some of the shots do look very CG but hey its a low budget movie and it was still startling, so it worked anyway.  The Host belongs up there with the greats in the genre like King Kong, Jaws, Gojira, Rodan, etc."}, {"date": "Feb 16, 2008", "score": 5, "text": "My favorite Monster Movie.

What they also have in common is a distrust of authority which then was possibly an aftereffect of Vietnam and Watergate(mind the hackneyed generalization) and in the present day, it is a part of the world we live in of perpetual war.(Director Bong Joon-ho also took aim at the authorities in his previous movie, \"Memories of a Murder.\") And it may be easy to look down and laugh at the family because of their faults, but remember they are the courageous heroes of the movie who search for Hyun-seo while the military sits on their hands.

The film that really caught my eye and put Korea on the map, for me, was [b]Oldboy[/b]. I continued to watch the films of Chan-wook Park, and was consistently amazed at his incredible sense of style. I remember wondering why it was that so many American releases lacked this flare. Of course, not all stories are suited to surreal imagery and rousing electronic scores - but it seemed like other filmmakers could really learn a thing or two from Chan-wook Park about how to compose a great shot. Then I saw [b]Memories of Murder[/b] - a similarly stylish crime thriller, which managed to infuse the beautiful cinematography I had come to expect from Korean cinema with a true-life story which oozed realism and heartbreak.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v496/megladon8/host2.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSometime in the summer of 2007, I heard about [b]The Host[/b], the next film from [b]Memories of Murder[/b] writer/director Joon-ho Bong, and I was incredibly excited to see it. The reviews coming out stating it was \u0093one of the greatest monster movies ever made\u0094 whet my appetite even further, and led me to order the official Korean DVD of the film. I was disappointed to say the least. I couldn\u0092t put my finger on it, but I just felt it lacked something. Perhaps it was because I was in the middle of a Godzilla-stint and I was in the mood for a little more building-crushing, but I doubt that\u0092s the case. Let\u0092s just say I wasn\u0092t ready for what the film had to offer.\r\n\r\nSo after several months of deliberation, I decided to crack open the DVD case again in hopes that my $20 hadn\u0092t gone to waste completely. What I got with this second viewing was the equivalent of going back to your old kindergarten class to find that your teacher was actually a sexy minx, and you simply hadn\u0092t seen it due to your (at the time) undeveloped libido. [b]The Host[/b] is an awe-inspiring film experience, and it does so much more with the monster movie conventions than any Godzilla film has done in many years.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v496/megladon8/host3.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nTelling a story at once epic and microscopic, satirical and straight-forward, it is on one hand the story of an irresponsible father coming to realize that if he really loves his daughter and his family members, he needs to actually do something with his life and try to make something out of himself. He needs to fill that void where fatherly responsibility has been lacking for so long. On the other hand, it is a story of the sensational paranoia the media is capable of evoking in people, as it refers back to a real-life case in Korea in which an American doctor ordered a Korean intern to dump several bottles of formaldehyde down a sink which he knew drained into the Han River. In real life this case was blown hugely out of proportion - he did something irresponsible, yet it turned into an enormous incident between the two countries. This incident is the catalyst event for the creation of the monster - which, in itself, is the catalyst for the coming-of-age story of a grown man who has spent too much time living the life of a boy. \r\n\r\nIt would be deceiving to say that the monster is not the most important part of the film, since it [i]is[/I] a monster movie, and at its most basic state that is what drives the plot. But there\u0092s so much more to the story, involving human connection and some unexpected yet very effective humor. The first appearance of a Korean soldier wearing a HAZMAT suit is one of the funniest moments in the film, as he walks into a room full of civilians and is clearly trying to look as imposing and authoritative as possible, before suddenly tripping on his own feet and falling flat on his back. It\u0092s a simple sight gag, but in the rather bleak context of the scene, it works very well.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v496/megladon8/host4.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nSince the film has been out for nearly two years now, the monster is no surprise - simply type \u0093The Host monster\u0094 into any image search engine and you\u0092ll be bombarded with images of what could best be described as a mutant tadpole the size of a bus. But the monster was never really meant to be a secret or a surprise. Unlike another recent monster film, the trailers for [b]The Host[/b] showed the monster in full right from the start. Again, this just reinforces the fact that the monster is not the biggest surprise to be found in the film. The plot twists and turns, characters change or meet unexpected demises, and the writing keeps everything engaging throughout.\r\n\r\nBut that\u0092s not to say that the monster is insignificant. Its presence is strong and there are some surprisingly chilling scenes to be found involving the creature. Seeing it disappear under the water of the Han River and then only a dark figure swim to the shore before suddenly springing from the water to grab an unsuspecting victim is an unnerving sight. And the CGI used to create the monster is great. The textures look real and wet, and you can practically smell the fishy stink of its leathery, amphibious flesh.\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v496/megladon8/host1.jpg[/IMG]\r\n\r\nIt\u0092s great to know that not only can monster films still be made well, but they can be taken seriously. The humor to be found in the film does not consist of self-deprecating winks at the audience, instead adding a great deal of emotional attachment to the characters. [b]The Host[/b] is a solid film, and one that can be enjoyed by both monster-enthusiasts and movie-goers looking for a generally well made, well performed movie."}, {"date": "Feb 13, 2008", "score": 4, "text": "What if it will be ture? who knows?"}, {"date": "Feb 13, 2008", "score": 4.5, "text": "Korean monster movie that rocks on multiple levels."}, {"date": "Feb 13, 2008", "score": 4, "text": "Must see movie for monster movie lovers and thriller fans."}, {"date": "Feb 13, 2008", "score": 2.5, "text": "wasn't as good as i thought it would be"}, {"date": "Feb 13, 2008", "score": 3.5, "text": "There were parts that were great.

They've either been sado-masochistic such as the remakes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes, or they've been expensive rehashes of Asian horror films such as The Grudge and The Ring. \n\nNow comes the second great film from Korea (the first was the incredibly poetic and violent Oldboy), The Host (Gwoemul). The host brings back a bygone age of horror movies that has been missing for a long time, the monster movie. Not only is the best monster movie in about twenty years, but it has one of the coolest monsters to hit celluloid since The Predator. \n\nThe opening five minutes are by far the silliest in the movie. On an American military base, an American doctor orders his Korean subordinate to dump tons of \"dirty formaldihyde\" down the drain and into the Han River. Now I don't think for one second that this would create the monster that is to come, nor do I think the filmmakers do either. This scene really sets up what The Host's real subject is about, interruption of daily life by an outside influence. \n\nSkip around about six years where we meet the Park family. They have a food stand on the side of the Han River. The Parks are made up of a grandfather, his two sons and one daughter, and one grandchild to the laziest of the sons. It is that same son that sees something strange hanging from a bridge over the river. Along with other spectators who gather to watch, they observe the thing dive into to the water with grace. Some even call it an \"Amazonian River Dolphin\", and start throwing junk into the river to get it's attention. Needless to say it does and soon everybody's running for cover as the monster starts tearing through it's victims. During the chaos, the monster grabs the youngest park and takes her out to the river and puts her in a little cove for safe keeping (late night snack). \n\nThe rest of the family is herded off to a gymnasium with the other survivors where they're told that the monster contains a virus that infects all that it touches. The Park family pull off a daring escape in a van that almost reminded me of Little Miss Sunshine (being that both families are incredibly dysfunctional, where would I get such an idea?). They go after the monster in the sewers of Seoul while the police and the hazmat teams, not to mention the US military and Korean revolutionaries are hunting for them.\n\nThe film, like all monster movies, isn't interested in realism, but is wanting to talk more about family dynamics, the lobsided affairs between the US and Korea, and weapons that are waged on average people, both by propaganda and by chemical substance. There are great scenes of splendid drama where characters are revealed with such tenderness and understanding that we like them, warts and all. The film shows a Korea split at the seams with paranoia and fear, fueled by US involvement, perhaps with a little more gasoline concerning North Korea's tinkering with nuclear weapons. By the time we get to the final act, there can be said that the last victims of the monster, are by far the most representative of what South Korea faces soon. \n\nBut strictly as a monster movie, this is by far one of my favorites. And the reason primarily is because this is one of the coolest monsters ever made. Using the digital work of San Francisco's The Orphanage effects team, this monster moves like a squid in the water, but is more dangerous when dangling from above or on the ground. The way it eats it's victims is not exploitive, like our slasher killers. It's innards work like a snake that swallows it's victims whole. \n\nIt bothers me that this movie, which does not have any graphic violence or extreme use of blood, gets an R rating when Ghost Rider allows us to see a man's head disintigrate in much detail down to the skull and gets a PG-13. If this isn't perverse, then please tell me what is. This just goes to show the truly corrupt system put into place by the Motion Picture Association of America. \n\nDirector Joon-ho Bong has made a film that was widely recieved in South Korea, and I am truly thankful he was able to export it to American audiances. While this is not a flawless movie (there are scenes that just do not work, and a little too much forshadowing in all the usual spots), it has a vibrancy and a fun about it that makes this a joy to watch. Let's just hope he keeps the Americans from remaking this into a travesty. \n\nAll in all, if you like a good-old-fashioned horror movie that gives you the right amount of chills and spills, but also dark comedy with a bit of slapstick, you're not going to find a better movie this season. But there's one thing I need make note, and perhaps you'll have your own interpretation. Does the title refer to the monster that's devouring the country, or the country that's being devoured by the monster. And if it's the latter, what might be the REAL monster?[/font]"}, {"date": "Feb 03, 2008", "score": 5, "text": "Very good movie.

It wasn\u0092t like Frankenstein or Godzilla or any of the others I can remember from my childhood, and it will very likely change the nature of monster movies to come - a new benchmark - and when it comes out on video in a few months, I\u0092ll have more to say about it then. But in the meantime, it reminded me of another great monster film I\u0092d seen recently - this week\u0092s movie, THE HOST.\n\n I was really young when I saw my first \u0093monster attacks the city\u0094 movie. It was [url=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047034/\"]Godzilla[/url] and I was about 8 years old. It was simultaneously thrilling and terrifying. And even though the logic side of my brain told me that it was just make-believe, I would still, for years since, always keep check on the horizon when I was outdoors \u0096 because you never know when a prehistoric creature in a rubber suit, created by atomic radiation, might decide to rampage through my town and my parents would probably have to buy a new car and thus wouldn\u0092t be able to afford a new bicycle for yours truly \u0096 then I\u0092d be stuck running beside my friends, trying like hell to keep up, thus getting so tired that I\u0092d fall asleep early and thus wouldn\u0092t be able to stay up late enough to watch the monster movies, shown on TV late at night. \u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.could happen.\n\n I can\u0092t say for sure why some of us are drawn to such movies. Maybe we have that sort of morbid curiosity that is fascinated by large scale destruction. Maybe we identify with the creature \u0096 \u0093I want to knock down big buildings!\u0094 Maybe it\u0092s the same compulsion that made you want to knock down your little brother\u0092s tower of building blocks as you walk by \u0096 just because.\n\n Years ago I watched a movie on TV (It may have been a \u0093made for TV\u0094 movie) called [url=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079573/\"]Monstroid[/url].  During the opening credits they flashed the claim \u0093Based on actual events.\u0094  You might think, \u0093So what?  Lots of films are based on true stories.\u0094  True enough \u0096 but this one was about a giant dinosaur that rises from the sea and terrorizes a coastal fishing village.  Funny that I never read about that in the paper \u0085\u0085\u0085oh wait \u0096 maybe I did read about that once in the Weekly World News between the article about how Satan is a space alien and the latest exploits of the Bat Boy.   Lately though, I\u0092ve been disappointed with monster movies. For me, Godzilla was the biggest and baddest of them all. The second-rate copies that came after just didn\u0092t cut it \u0096 like [url=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055198/\"]Mothra[/url], and [url=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/\"]Gamera[/url], and [url=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024216/\"]King Kong[/url] (please ignore, for the moment, that fact that King Kong was actually made some 20 years or so before Godzilla \u0096 I\u0092m trying to make a point here.), but I watched them and loved them just the same.  The problem is that I\u0092ve grown up and they hadn\u0092t. I hadn\u0092t, until now found a film that was as thrilling and scary \u0085\u0085\u0085.and fun as the early classics to a young boy \u0085\u0085\u0085.as I said, until now. THE HOST is such a film. It has the right combination of scary monster, thrilling action, political satire, stress releasing comedy, mayhem, and uplifting heroics as they did when I was a boy. Finally, the monster movie has grown up.\n\n This film has often been described as \u0093Godzilla vs. [url=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449059/\"]Little Miss Sunshine[/url]\u0094. This is true to an extent. It\u0092s not as much about the monster as it is about the Park family. Three generations of the Park family live together in a trailer on the banks of the Han River in Seoul, South Korea (yes \u0096 it\u0092s Korean \u0096 but the subtitles are easy to read and if you don\u0092t want to read those, my copy of the DVD had an English-dubbed soundtrack \u0096 but gobs are lost in the translation \u0096 I recommend you brave through the subtitles \u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.unless you\u0092re Korean that is). They are a profoundly dysfunctional family but manage to pull together and support one another when the chips are down. In that way, it is similar to Little Miss Sunshine. The monster isn\u0092t humongous, like Godzilla. It can\u0092t knock down buildings and terrorize entire populations at the same time \u0096 but it is rather creepy nevertheless, and it can certainly terrorize a few dozen people at the same time at any rate.\n\n THE HOST is funny without being a comedy.  It\u0092s scary without being gross and turning your stomach.  It\u0092s dramatic without being soppy.  It\u0092s a political satire without preaching, and it\u0092s action packed without seeming unrealistic (except that there\u0092s this monster).  I\u0092m hoping that this will spur a renewal of interest in making monster movies.  I think it may already have started (reference again to the new film \u0093Cloverfield\u0094).  I know that if I ever get the chance to make a film, I have lots of monster ideas \u0096 but I know that will never happen.  So \u0085..here are my monster movie ideas that will probably never see the light of day.\n\n \n\n [list=1][*][b]VORAX: Destroyer of Worlds![/b] \u0096 Vorax, the most fearsome creature in the Andromeda Galaxy, travels throughout the galaxy destroying and devouring planets. When he is sucked through a wormhole and reappears in our own solar system, he sets his sights on the Earth. Our doom seems certain, causing panic worldwide \u0096 until it is discovered that, due to a miscalculation in scale, Vorax is actually half an inch tall.[*][b]TERROR FROM THE DEEP[/b] \u0096 In the future, the ocean is pristine. A century of human efforts have paid off and the ocean is once again clean. A monstrous sea creature, fed up with humans cleaning up his domain, rises up and attacks New York. He lumbers down street after street cleaning up the litter and the trash and the garbage, leaving sparkly clean streets in its wake \u0096 and bellowing \u0093How do you like it? How do you like it?!!!!\u0094 Street cleaners and garbage collectors are suddenly out of work, tipping the already teetering unemployment scales into instability. The economy crashes sending the country into a deep depression. Mayhem, destruction, oh the terror, oh the terror\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085from the deep.[*][b]SLUMMO: The Rude Clown!!![/b] \u0096 A giant clown-like creature attacks the city making rude gestures and dropping its pants-like garment. Citizens are disgusted and evacuate the city in droves, but SLUMMO has his giant squirting flower-like object waiting for them.[*][b]PLANETRON: The Careful[/b] \u0096 Planetron, a giant prehistoric sea serpent, rises up to attack Tokyo \u0096 but he doesn\u0092t do it all at once. The 300 ft. tall creature first does a walk-through, taking copious notes and occasionally taking out a huge tape measure to check building heights and widths etc. He\u0092ll use this data to plan his attack at a later time so that he\u0092ll know which buildings he is able to knock down for maximum terrifying effect.[*] [b]The Return of PLANETRON[/b] \u0096 PLANETRON attacks Tokyo with maximum terrifying effect.[*][b]KLAXON: The Annoying \u0096 [/b]Klaxon, a giant space alien, is not very powerful, so it can\u0092t really cause any actual damage itself, and it can\u0092t really harm anyone \u0085\u0085directly \u0096 BUT \u0096 it\u0092s really really loud and annoying. So much so that eventually the city sustains damage and mayhem as the military knocks down buildings in an effort to chase Klaxon away. Thousands are killed in the stampede to \u0093get the hell out of Dodge\u0094, much of it due to lack of communication as most people have their ears stuffed with cotton, or stones, or small animals \u0096 basically anything they can manage to shove in there just to shut Klaxon the hell up.[*][*][b]THE BEING OF UNKNOWN HORRORS[/b] -  An earthquake opens a fissure releasing a giant creature.  The populace is horrified but it doesn\u0092t know why.[*][b]THE NO-NONSENSE BEAST[/b] \u0096 A humongous monster attacks an unsuspecting city.  It stomps cars, knocks down buildings, gobbles up people by the boatload.  It withstands every weapon the army and scientists throw at it.  That\u0092s it!  The no-nonsense beast.  What\u0092s the hook, you ask?  An all-orangutan cast.  [*][b]THE MONSTER WHO WAS AFRAID OF OTHER MONSTERS [/b]\u0096 A large horrible creature, named TELEPHONOPHOBIA, rises from the deep.  It attacks only small towns and suburbs.  Why?  It heard that loads of monsters were attacking the big cities like New   York, Tokyo, London \u0096 and he owes most of them money.  Thus he eschews the obvious target cities and turns up in places like Schenectady, Newport News, and Peoria \u0096 the \u0093big monster in a little pond\u0094 philosophy.  [*][b]THE MONSTER WHO DIDN\u0092T SHOW UP \u0096 [/b]A 500 ft prehistoric sea serpent completely fails to rise from the sea, doesn\u0092t bother to knock down buildings, totally neglects to terrorize innocent citizens, and generally blows off the chance to rampage through Manhattan \u0096 much to the chagrin of city officials who ordered the city to be evacuated and the military to be on hand for just such an occasion \u0096 and are now looking pretty foolish \u0096 and have sent their aides to look for \u0093a Godzilla costume and a camcorder \u0096 and step on it if you don\u0092t mind\u0094.  Oh the horror \u0085\u0085.the horror.

It stands out because it does more than just try to be different from other monster films, but shows the love for the classics while doing its own thing.  Joon-ho Bong mixes satire with a comedic dysfunctional family story with a monster horror.  There were moments when I was torn apart by the scene, other times when I'm laughing at the characters, and sometimes a mixture of both.  One scene that stands out is when the whole family is mourning over the loss of Hyun-seo because she had just gotten eaten by the monster, yet the film slowly turns their mourning into a comedic moment.  Joon-ho Bong knows how to make his audience feel strange.  And I thought that Baumbach was the king of that.  Bong obviously has a distaste for the American government and their foreign policy.  Every single problem happens because of US involvement.  An american man tells the lab assistant to pour the chemicals into the sink, but the assistant tries to warn the American against doing this because it will flow into the river but it doesn't matter.  A few weeks later the little baby monster is found in the river by a couple of fisherman, then a few months later it is seen hanging upside down from a bridge.  The government decides they will intervene and stop the monster, but they believe the monster is carrying a virus that is infecting the people in the city.  Even though Gang-Du is trying to find his daughter, he is captured by the government and put into a hospital with the other \"infected\" people.  Gang-Du forces his way out of the hospital with his family so they can save Hyun-seo after Gang-Du gets a phone call from her.  No one believes she is alive, but he knows what he heard.  This is where the comedy and tragedy both play.  Gang-Du is kind of an airhead.  He can fall asleep in the most drastic times and he doesn't always make the right decisions. This can be hilarious while at the same time horrible.  When they are running from the monster Gang-Du falls and tries to get back up with Hyun-seo, but realizes he is holding the wrong hand.  He is later made fun of for this.  His family laughs at him for sleeping all the time.  Neither the Korean nor American workers will listen to him.  I felt bad for him.  One of the best family moments comes when Gong-Du's father tries to explain to his siblings how he was trying to fend for himself as a young teenager, but when he failed at stealing food he would get beaten up which caused a problem with his protein.  His father understands that he tries and that his heart is always in the right place.  It's such a beautiful moment, but here are the siblings in the background falling asleep to the story.  I could go on and on about the greatness of The Host, but seriously, it's just one of the best.  \n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nThe ending where Gong-Du finds Hyun-seo dead is sad, but it continues with the killing of the monster perfectly.  We want to see it dead not because it's a monster, but because it has destroyed what we cared about so much.  They did it perfectly having the brother throwing Molotov cocktails at it, then miss on the last one when the gasoline is poured, then have the sister who is a world class archer shoot it into his eye.  When it runs I was afraid it would get into the water, but here comes Gang-Du to finish it off by shoving a pole in its mouth and holding it back.  Perfect ending to a perfect film."}, {"date": "Jan 29, 2008", "score": 5, "text": "Good lord this movie is pretty fuckin awesome. Screw Cloverfield & King Kong, baby!

The soundtrack fit the film well, and the cinematography was great. The monster itself was so well integrated that it felt much more real than the CGI creation it was. The Host draws you in quite a bit overall, it keeps itself from being too heavy and potentially overwhelming through lots of effectively executed humor that set it apart from most films of its kind. The political commentary made is worth noting as well. Ultimately though, as a film, The Host isn't going to blow you away or change how you think about things. It will, however, thoroughly entertain you for its entire run, as it's much fresher and smarter than most films in the genre.

Some monster movies are indeed horror movies, but many are a genre unto themselves.  Movies like Ron Underwood?s Tremors, John Carpenter?s The Thing, and David Croenberg?s The Fly have all told great stories that happened to have large dangerous monsters at their centers.   The genre has been around since early B-movies of the Godzilla vein, but the granddaddy of most modern Monster movies is almost certainly Steven Spielberg?s Jaws.  As everyone (and I mean everyone) already knows, Jaws was effective because of how little of the shark was shown. Most filmmakers studied that film and reused the trick for their own monster movies.  After thirty years of this it?s nice to see a film like The Host that completely ignores this trick and is willing to just show a monster doing its thing.\r\n\tThe film begins with and American scientist ordering his South Korean assistant to dump large quantities of formaldehyde into the Han River.  Predictably this results in the creation of a mutated amphibian monster the size of a semi-truck.  This creature announces itself to the world when it begins a violent attack at the riverside.  At the riverside during the attack are Park Gang-du (Kang-ho Song) and his daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko).  Toward the end of the attack the monster captures Hyun-seo and hides her in his sewer lair for some reason.  The American government reveals that one of their officers present at the river attack had become infected with a virus, as such Park Gang-du, his father (Hie-bong Byeon), his brother (Hae-il Park) and  his sister (Du-na Bae) are all detained and quarantined.  This quirky and often dysfunctional family must work together to escape custody and save Hyun-seo before the monster gets hungry again.\r\n\tThe monster in The Host is fairly well designed; It looks a bit too venerable but has enough of a menacing presence to make the attack scenes work.  The special effects are pretty good by the standards of non-hollywood cinema, it is clear they were working with a budget here.  The monster doesn?t look like much compared with a Hollywood production, but they?re good enough to not be distracting during the creature scenes.  \r\n\tThere are a number of political undertones in the script, but it is fairly simple minded and at many times feels like little more than xenophobia.  The United States is blamed for pretty much everything that goes on in the movie: an American dumps the chemicals that create the monster, The United States military is blamed for starting a virus scare, and the United States begins dropping a chemical called ?Agent Yellow? on the city for no apparent reason.  This simple minded Anti-Americanism works to add a sense of intelligence to this potentially mindless script but it hardly stands up to the level of a serious political movie.\r\n\tThe human characters in The Host are amusing.  The father, Park Gang-du, is a bit of a slacker, and his father works pretty well as a family patriarch.   Gang-du?s sister is an Olympic archer (for reasons that will be very obvious to anyone familiar with this genre) while his brother seems to be a fairly generic badass.  None of these characters are overly complex or even particularly interesting, but they aren?t transparently weak either.  They are humorous enough though, and they provide a good human perspective to the story.  The characters don?t stand out but they are good enough.\r\n\t?Good enough? actually applies to most of the movie?s many aspects.  The film tries to be a lot of things; it tries to be a monster movie, a political movie, and a film about a dysfunctional family.  The film succeeds moderately well at all of these things; it?s a jack of all trades and a master of none.  The Host will please fans of the genre and those looking for something different in their sci-fi action, but it will probably not blow anyone away."}, {"date": "Jan 02, 2008", "score": 5, "text": "Picture this: a giant monster terrorizing a city.

I watched this last night with my somewhat 'just friend' blah blah whatever she is and she fell asleep, and I would've too if I wasn't such a fan of monster movies. For some who might think this review is biased, know this: I live for monster movies. My 'just friend' I mentioned above can vouche for this. I have every Godzilla movie ever made on DVD (some illegal) and I have two pet dinosaur eels named Loche and Champ. Not kidding. But the fact is, this is a movie which is so packed with anti-American messages and stupid humor that it very nearly comes off as a spoof. It really does. There are often times, like in the very beginning, when it is painfully obvious that all director Joon-ho is doing is talking about how stupid and stubborn America is. When the film starts, an American scientist tells his Korean (this is a Korean film, not a Japanese one like some people are suggesting) assisstant to dump the chemical down the drain, but NOT before talking for five minutes about how dangerous it is. America rocks!\r\n\r\nThe writing is bad. And I'm not talking about the fact that the dubbing is so horrible that it's really hard to pay attention without laughing every five minutes. The monster's coming to be is classic, as in it's a product of chemical runoff, and doesn't waste time trying to explain it scientifically (The Mist did this well). This a good thing. What's a bad thing is when the human characters' actions are so horribly written that it makes it almost painful to watch. There is one scene where two hazmat-like workers stop a truck because one saw a dollar-which was practically invsible-in a sewage drain...on the other side of the truck. Of course, they become monster food. But that's the problem with this script, as in too many of the actions are forced and work only to move along the ridiculous story reminiscent of something from Roger Corman in 1992-oh yeah, Carnosaur. Did I mention this movie is kinda like that?\r\n\r\nBy the way, before I continue, why is this thing rated R? Just thought I'd ask. Because, honestly, the big F-bomb comes up just once, and I think it's the only cuss word in the whole movie, and there's less gore than on an old episode of Power Rangers.\r\n\r\nThe story is also painfully silly. Why is it so easy for two guys to sneak into a military base who aren't even wearing military colors? How can a drunk suddenly go all Tom Cruise on some police officers and escape a high-rise building? All these ludicrous subplots seriously detract from the monster itself. In fact, the monster seems like so little of an actual threat that it often takes a back seat to everything else happening.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where I stop totally ripping this movie and talk about the good stuff: the monster itself. The 'Host' is a neat-looking, well thought of, creative, and thoroughly good monster. Its emergence from the river in the beginning is memorable beyond words, and is clearly the best scene in the movie. This monster, unlike ours like King Kong or the Japanese Godzilla, is often much more terrifying. It's quick, it's scary looking, it's brutal, and it doesn't think. It attacks, it kills, and thanks to the special effects of Weta (which worked on King Kong by the way) is simply amazing to look at. When the Host is on screen, this movie is excellent. \r\n\r\nSo after watching this movie, I have found a way to make it better.\r\n\r\n1) take out the dubbing and PLEASE just watch it in Korean with english subtitles\r\n2) take out all of the scenes that don't have the monster in it (about an hour and a half of film time)\r\n3) up the volume on what you have left\r\n\r\nSimply put, The Host has some of the most intense, beautifully-rendered monster scenes ever conceived, yet it is unfortunatley wrapped in what is a horrible script with horrible actors.

All the ?evil government? stuff dragged the movie down a lot, had it been a little more focused it would have been much more enjoyable. The monster effects are also a bit of a mixed bag. Sometimes the creature looks amazing and sometimes it looks like something from The Lawnmower Man.

[i]No Country for Old Men [/i]is deep, riveting, epic, strangely funny, and suspenseful. Actually, calling it 'suspenseful' is a major understatement. It's sometimes so intensely suspenseful that it becomes downright terrifying. Lots of this is due to Javier Bardem's truly frightening and award-worthy performance as one of the scariest villians in cinema history. On a different note, many have complained about [i]No Country[/i]'s strange ending, but I actually loved the final scene.

It's a quirky monster movie (yes, quirky) that never failed to entertain and sometimes even amaze me. It's an all-around fun time that works on many levels - as a family melodrama, a comedy, a cautionary tale, and a government cover-up conspiracy - but all these welcome additions to the mix don't take away from the fact that [i]The Host [/i]is just a campy monster movie at heart. The attack scenes with the mutated fish were just flat-out wild, especially the first attack on unsuspecting onlookers. There also were some surprisingly intense moments - [i]The Host [/i]isn't ever truly scary, but the scenes with the children in the sewer were unexpectedly suspenseful. Overall, this was a crazy and original monster flick that I really enjoyed. Two thumbs up for sure.

In this, it is equal to other great monster movies from the original \"Godzilla\" to \"Island of Terror\", and through to \"Slither\". What sets this film apart from other monster movies is the Park family in this movie. The way NONE of them can ever quite manage to rise to whatever challenge is facing them is alternately funny, tragic, sad (sometimes all three at the same time), and so realistic that it gives this movie a totally unique quality. Although families drawing together to fight a monster threatening them--and ultimately triumphing exactly because they have drawn together-- is nothing new, I don't think there's ever been a movie family quite like the Parks before.\n \n(Nowhere was the Park family trait of never quite crossing the threshold of success more clearly spelled out when the 7th-grader who the rest of the family is trying to rescue devises a way out of the monster's lair on her own... only to discover that all her work amounts to nothing when her rope made from the clothes of partially digested victims ends up being too short to be useful.)\n \nThis film is even more impressive because of the way the story resolves itself. The outcome of the climactic battle is in perfect keeping with everything we know about the Parks and their lives, but I still expected I very different ending than what was delivered. \n \nWith a good script, excellent special effects, decent acting, and some fantastic moments (the sequence where the monster attacks the crowds in the park along the Han River is one of the best monster attack scenes ever put on film,), the film could have rated a Nine or even Ten if not the way it starts to meander a bit as it closes in on its climax. Basically, the director and screenwriters felt the need to inject a nefarious conspiracy by the United States military into the film--probably so they wanted the International Community to know how kewl they are!--and it served no purpose other than to slow things down and detract from the film's center, the Park family. It's a testament to how strong everything else is that it stays on track and manages to pull together for its climax. (BTW, in fairness, I should mention that a civilian employee of the US military in South Korea DID dump chemicals into the Han River, and the US DID take measures to keep him from being punished under Korean law.)\n \nAside from a single misstep motivated by the director's desire to be invited to cocaine-fueled orgies at Hugo Chavez's presidential palace (or maybe just to get a fan letter from Kim Jong-Ill), \"The Host\" is a spectacular monster movie with a unique flaire. Every horror fan should check it out, particularly if you enjoyed \"Tremors\" or \"Slither\".\n \n \nThe Host (aka \"Gwoemul\" and \"Monster\")\nStarring: Kang Ho Song, Hie-bong Byeon, Ah-Sung Ko, Hae-il Park, and Du-na Bae\nDirector: Joon-ho Bong"}, {"date": "Oct 30, 2007", "score": 4, "text": "I've yet to see a Korean film that hasn't been surprising in some way.

It was filled with terrible voiceovers but that added to the fun feel of it while simultaneously taking attention away from the message the filmmakers were trying to get across. They really want to paint a scary portrait of the extent to which current goverment policies go to an extreme where the worst can be imagineable.\n\nThe movie is about a slacker single dad who works in his fathers small food stand right on the Han River in South Korea. He has a promising young daughter, a loving father, and a highly successful sister. Without warning the film jumps into a straight up monster movie in the tradition of \"Tremors\".\n\nThe girl is abducted, the family and the rest of the nation are told that they are possibly infected with an unknown virus and thus begins a frantic thriller finding a distraught family exhausting all resources to find a loved one. \n\nIt really is a political satire disguised as a foreign horror flick.

This is The Host, and it's probably one of the best movies to come out this year. While the story behind it isn't the most innovative, it's still very entertaining, and I dare a fan of high-octane modern horror/thrillers not to sink their teeth into this. It's two hours long, and feels a lot longer actually, but every second is packed to the brim with excellent, chilling visuals, a healthy, deep sense of adventure, and sprinkled lightly with some loopy midway carnival music at some points for extra effect (the soundtrack is brilliant!). The characters are obviously not the most fleshed out, this being a monster movie, but the acting is generally pretty good, and the characters enjoyable to watch, despite a few sticky moments (the crying scene at the very beginning of the movie was extremely overdone). Directing is very well done; crystal clear and polished, showcasing the best Asian horror has to offer.\n\nI did find it quite interesting how the monster is revealed in the beginning of the movie in it's entirety, not hidden by shadows or water or anything of the sort. I'm no monster movie connoisseur, but in most of the ones I've seen (Jaws, Creep, etc), the monster is usually kept unseen for a good portion of the movie, to build suspense and terror. Not here. \"The Host\" is openly revealed to the world, without a grand opening of the curtain or a suspenseful unmasking, and while it seems odd at first, the movie is structured to the point where this doesn't matter. It's just an interesting curiosity.\n\nWhile The Host isn't fully realized in every area (the ending is slightly lacking, and a few characters were definitely not given the proper treatment they needed), and while it's definitely not perfect, it's an extremely entertaining, thrilling, monster movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat for a full 2 hours.

Specifically, the lack of influence upon it by the movie-pop-culture of the Western World. As fulfilling as it is to mention this point, one can never forget that within film, Hollywood influences everything. Such is and was the reach of said institute, it has inspired and captivated many. This by no means excludes Asian filmmakers however original they may be. One case in particular is South Korean writer/director Bong Joon-ho who received critical acclaim and worldwide exposure for his 2003 effort '[b]Memories of Murder[/b]'. A film that reinvents the serial police thriller genre that was rife in American cinema throughout the eighties and early nineties. Next up for Bong Joon-ho was the monster-movie genus, something particularly prevalent in both American and Asian cinematic history.\n\n[img]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee162/jedimoonshyne4/3-8.jpg[/img]\n\nSince hitting Western shores, '[b]The Host[/b]' has been compared to many films, a fact perhaps unavoidable considering the director's outlook. One such comparison has been drawn between itself and Steven Spielberg's iconic '[b]Jaws[/b]' - a film that explores the catastrophic consequences of a monster created by Mother nature herself. Bong Joon-ho has gone a distinctly different route however, focusing upon the slightly less mysterious yet altogether more perilous idea of a man-made monster. A subject that brings with it all kinds of issues; pollution and politics to name but two. '[b]The Host[/b]' follows a bumbling father Gang-du (played by the much-loved Song Kang-ho), who is drifting through a life of incompetence when the unthinkable occurs. A horrifyingly beastly product of the local toxic-laden river begins terrorising a nation known for its flappability. Director Joon-ho plays on this well, throwing out political swipes aimed at the widespread panic induced by the (very real) SARS epidemic not long ago. Using Gang-du as the innocent figure caught up in this mess.\n\n[img]http://i235.photobucket.com/albums/ee162/jedimoonshyne4/2-7.jpg[/img]\n\nJust as with the crime-thriller genre, Joon-ho does an excellent job respecting yet differentiating from the well-trodden generic path. Creating a film that is a lot more conscious of the message it presents. On the outside, '[b]The Host[/b]' is an exciting and suspense-fuelled blockbuster, action dripping from its pores. Yet inside the film is itching to make a point, and to do so with a well-practiced smirk and occasional wink. Each member of the family-cast is well aware of the subtle humour that the film offers up, and as is such with Asian wit - they perform with straight faces throughout despite the plot's sporadic hilarity. As a film that defines itself using the work of others, '[b]The Host[/b]' is an incredibely original feat. One that takes a tongue-in-cheek stance, proving to be as infectious as it is barefaced.\n\n[b]8/10 [img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/fresh.gif[/img][/b]"}, {"date": "Sep 10, 2007", "score": 2.5, "text": "The creature effects were fantastic.

When the driver crashes his car in the middle of nowhere, that's when the movie gets more interesting. The romantic subplot made me feel less interested about the development of the movie. The ghost hauntings were mildly scary and eerie.  There were some plot holes, but mostly unnoticeable because of the fine interactions between Emily Blunt and Ashton Holmes. What astounded me about this indie film, was there were very little horror cliches shown. Also, an unusual ending for a thriller or even for a horror movie, that made me feel somehow pleased[/size].

To a small degree, the special effects were astounding. The family were the main focus of the movie, not the big mutated fish-monster itself. Each family member was given a little bit of introduction, for us to care about them later in the movie. The dialogue was comical, but not too over-the-top. The second last scene was well thought-out. But the final scene was unsatisfactory due to no explanation of what happened to the rest of the Park family or the whole community[/size].[img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/user/smilies/tongue.gif[/img]\n                               \n                               \n [img]http://www.moviexclusive.com/review/fragile/poster.jpg[/img]\n \n                               [size=3][b]Fragile: [/b]The two strongest qualities of this movie, were the script and Calista Flockhart's intriguing performance and even the young actress, Yasmin Murphy (Maggie).

But we never got the chance to find out the reasons for the hauntings and killings until almost at the very end of the movie. However, the final shot remained touching and sensitive.

As fast as lightning, this toxic and hungry feeding machine is out of the water, on to land, and chomping away on innocent civilians.[/color][/size][/font]\n\n[center][font=Arial][size=3][color=green][img]http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/insomniacsplague/Movie%20Pictures/host2.jpg[/img] [img]http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/insomniacsplague/Movie%20Pictures/host4.jpg[/img][/color][/size][/font][/center]\n\n[font=Arial][size=3][color=green]When Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung), the young daughter of Gand-du (Song Kang-ho), a local, but lazy snack vendor, is kidnapped by the creature and taken back to its sewer lair (shot mostly in real sewer locales, not sets) to serve as a midnight snack. Feeling completely miserable, and responsible for letting her get snatched away by the big beast, Gand-du unites with the rest of his whole family; his father, sister and brother, a really crew of misfits if there every was one, to work together to rescue her from the clutches of the beast.[/color][/size][/font]\n\n[font=Arial][size=3][color=green]There\u0092s only one problem: the government has begun rounding up survivors who may have come into contact with the monster, and are setting up quarantine, fearing that the monster might be carrying and playing host to a deadly virus.[/color][/size][/font]\n\n[font=Arial][size=3][color=green]Of course there\u0092s no real proof to suggest that any virus actually exists, but it\u0092s the government and whatever the government says, must be true, right? Yes, layered within this goofy monster feature is a social commentary on the government\u0092s abuse of misinformation. Does it work? Surprisingly, it does. The public\u0092s paranoia about the virus strangely, but appropriately echoes of the SARS or Avian Bird Flu epidemic.[/color][/size][/font]\n\n[font=Arial][size=3][color=green]Like George A. Romero before him, director Joon-Ho Bong takes what is simply just another \u0093monster movie\u0094 and gives us not one monster, but two. The first being the nasty beast the leaps out of the Han River, and the other being the government\u0092s ruthless and completely asinine approach to \u0093dealing\u0094 with the problem.[/color][/size][/font]\n\n[font=Arial][size=3][color=green]While the film does have its charms, and works from moment to moment, [i]The Host[/i] doesn\u0092t quite equal the sum of all its parts. The overall tone of the film is a bit spastic; constantly changing gears quickly from suspense to goofy humor, but what makes up for it is how the film is surprisingly unpredictable, and defies the majority of genre conventions and clich\u00e9s, and in doing so, [i]The Host[/i] takes on a wild and crazy life of its own. If you\u0092re a fan of monster movies, this one\u0092s worth checking out.[/color][/size][/font]\n\n[center][font=Arial][size=3][color=green][img]http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/insomniacsplague/Movie%20Pictures/host5.jpg[/img] [img]http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y44/insomniacsplague/Movie%20Pictures/host6.jpg[/img][/color][/size][/font][/center]"}, {"date": "Aug 27, 2007", "score": 4, "text": "Was pretty enjoyable.

The utterly dysfunctional characters bring life to this otherwise dull plot outline, and the colorful way the film was made made every scene very enjoyable. Unlike some American movies I've seen lately, this movie achieves humor without trying to hard (*cough* Scary Movie 4 *cough*).

I laughed, I groaned, I cried (well...), I cheered, and I got rather mad on occasion. \nWhat makes \"The Host\" special in my mind is how it is different from other movies that are out there. Everything from the characters to the way it provokes the feelings it provokes, is unexpected. Even the cinematography doesn't conform to how most movies are shot, and succeeds in making a very original movie. If I were to describe just a handful, I would double the length of my already fairly long review. That being said, I suggest that you watch it instead.

The mixture did not work in my taste although I have to admit I laughed but the acting was just terrible. The voice over is what ruined the film for me, I wish I could have had the option to watch the film in its original language and perhaps my take on the film would have been different, but the english version was horrible. The dubbing reminded me of the film Kung Pow but this movie is too seroius at times and the humor is only momentarily. This huge blockbuster in Corea is comparible to the latest American version of Godzilla which sucked. Godzilla only delivered some laughs as this film did. I expected much more from this movie so I was a little dissapointed but I cant say it was a bad movie either, it just didnt work for me. The plot just dragged a little too long and the only entertaining scene was the opening scene when the monster attacks everyone in the park by the lake. But the film went downhill from there when the government interferes with the whole virus scare.

The supposed comedy elements drag on for far too long and the opportunity for some truly terrifying moments is repeatedly missed. It never really knows what it is, it's not dead pan enough to be a comedy, not scary enough to be billed as horror and the monster isn't iconic enough to a 'Godzilla' like monster film.

A lot of the fear comes from the film's ability to make you feel the fear that one should feel when witnessing a monster run through your city, unlike other films where the sight of a monster is ineffective until it kills someone.  Even scarier is the way the film's protagonist, Gang-du, is treated by the government as a result of his attempts to find his daughter, in addition to the way the government deals with the chemical outbreak that created the monster in the first place.\nThe great story is coupled with a high production value, as director Bong Joon-ho creates fluid moments combined with solid visual effects that bring the hideous creature to life.

I also liked how, unlike most monster movies, they didn't wait until halfway through the movie to show it. It appeared very early in the movie, but at the same time it wasn't overused which helped build tension. A father and his extended family are reunited when the monster captures his daughter, however things become complicated when the government quarantines them, believing they have contracted a virus from the monster. The movie divides attention equally between the struggling family and the girl trying to escape, and I was impressed at how each member of the family was developed into a distinctly different character.

Honestly, it's great but it sucks.  But it's mostly great... it depends on which version you see, I suppose.  Basically, it's a great movie with some minor problems and one glaring problem.  But before I get into that, might as well get this out of the way - this movie has a fantastic aesthetic and plot, and works as an absolutely great monster movie.  It might be the best monster movie I have ever seen, even.  That is probably because it focuses on the story of a father trying to find his daughter after the monster snatched her rather than just \"Ahh!  A bit monster is attacking the city! Help!\" Though it gets a bit confusing at times, usually it works very well and even manages to be pretty creepy sometimes.  So here's the big problem - it's dubbed.  Now maybe if you speak Korean and you're watching the original, you can't complain about this.  And i doubt i would either.  And maybe there's an undubbed American version with subtitles(which is what I wanted to see).  I'm hoping there is one, but the one I know exists is the one I saw.  A great monster movie that was HORRIBLY dubbed in english.  Honestly, the voice overs are just about as terrible as you can get and make the movie so funny and pathetic-sounding at some of the most interesting parts that it completely destroys whatever the movie has going for it.  Are you eventually able to ignore it?  Not really.  But I suppose it's tolerable by the end... still, it's hard to take the movie seriously when all the actors are voiced over with overly-enthusiastic bad english actors that clearly don't have the best dialogue to work with either.  When they first see the monster the dialogue is along the lines of \"What is that?  What is that on the bridge?  It's swimming nearby!  I wonder what it could be!  What do you think it could be?\"  Take dialogue like that, add bad actors and crap in a cup.  Then you have The Host's voice overs.  Listen guys, I don't mind subtitles... but if you must... if you MUST dub it... jeez, get some talent.  Great movie.

If this movie were only twenty minutes long then it would probably be an 8 or 9 out of ten but it?s a 119 minutes long and that is its downfall. The opening scene where you are introduced to this aquatic monstrosity is fantastic and makes you think this could be the monster movie of 2007 but it goes no- where from the ending of this scene. The humor that they try to incorporate is not blended well and unfunny to boot. The characters and their interactions are unbearable and you are wishing the monster would just kill them off to end the misery of this film. The characters are so unappealing that it just makes you want to turn off the film and you could care less about their internal struggles. Main complaint of the movie is the monster stays basically in one place why wouldn?t the army just go there and kill it? Who writes this crap and thinks it is a viable script. The final straw for me was the daughter was an Olympic caliber bow shooter. Yes you guessed it she tries to bring down this monster with an arrow when she could have been using a gun. My critique just like this movie is poorly edited and doesn?t end even after I say the final straw(badly edited for joke), they introduce this chemical that is called Agent Yellow which is supposed to kill the monster. People are throwing up blood and yet the monster is all right and the people are fine as well after. The ending scene was just horribly put together and edited.

It was funny, horrifying, and heroic. \nI just loved how the comedy was just so random and damn hilarious. You don't expect it and that is the best kind. The film puts you on this intense roller coaster and it calms it when the comedy comes in. It makes you feel like \"Oh this movie is going to be silly\" but then something bad happens and you get the \"Oh fuck, are they serious?\" feeling. I think that is a brilliant way to do things. It gives you different emotions and feelings throughout the film which create a horror/comedy/paranoia/adventure atmosphere. Most movies now days just want to pick one of those elements and shove it down your throat. There is a chemistry, and The Host does a perfect job. \n\nThe rest of this review is going to turn into spoilers, so beware.\n\nMy favorite part of the film has to be the ending. I just loved it how everyone seems to just start dying and that there isn't going to be any hope in the movie. Then, all of the heroes \"come back from the dead\" (they never died I know, but that is a way to put it) and they all just get together to stop this monster that is taking over their city and harboring their niece/daughter. \n\nIt was just poetic how they all worked together and fought the beast off. It had a kind of existential ending with the daughter dying, but a little hope for the man who lost her with having a new son in his life. He wasn't going to go on in life having a void, he had a replacement. That sounds horrible that he lost his daughter, but his daughter was the hero in the film. She led them to the beast and helped save the boy. \n\nI think the only problem I had with the film was the beast itself. It just had the whole B-Movie animation to it. I think if this film had a bigger budget that it would be probably one of the best (sci fi? Horror? I'd say more Sci-Fi, but whatev)  to have been released. \n\nBrilliant movie, lovable characters, and terrific humor!"}, {"date": "Aug 06, 2007", "score": 4, "text": "good movie, the directing and shooting was outstanging, plot was great"}, {"date": "Aug 06, 2007", "score": 4, "text": "Crazy south Korean movie pretty feecent"}, {"date": "Aug 06, 2007", "score": 4, "text": "okay i watched dubbed which was a bad idea and so i gave it a 4 but i think that after i watch it again i might give it a 4 and a half"}, {"date": "Aug 06, 2007", "score": 3.5, "text": "i watched it in camp mujigae. i thought it was interesting story. kinda scared if you think it could be real. and i loved the ending scene where Du-na shoot an arrow with fire. awesome\r\ni could feel the family love"}, {"date": "Aug 06, 2007", "score": 3, "text": "A Korean monster movie... it was ok.

I've been re-watching a lot of movies lately and I find that I, usually, enjoy it more the second time than the first time.  I guess knowing what's going to happen, I look for the little details of the movie and the subtleties and nuances.  This movie is no different, I enjoyed it SO much more than I did the first time.  I don't think my rating will change, but this movie is really an excellent monster film.  On the DVD cover it says it's on par with Jaws.  And as much as I love this movie, I'll have to disagree with that, because is usually more suspenseful because you don't get to see the shark until, near, the end of the movie.  So when you see the shark for the first time, it's much more impressive because they found a way to turn a negative (the shark was originally supposed to be seen from the beginning, but the mechanical shark malfunctioned during the shoot, so the shark was mostly hinted at or you could just see the fin) into a positive.  So in that regards, Jaws is a much better film since in this film you get to see the monster from the very beginning.  It's not necessarily a negative at all, but it can't be compared to Jaws at all.  Plus this movie is actually much more than just a monster movie.  It's sort of a hybrid of Little Miss Sunshine (which came out that same year), Finding Nemo (at least the part of the father searching far and wide for his daughter, in this movie) and social commentary.  This movie succeeds in taking the monster genre and making it believable.  The problem with monster movies is that most of the times they're just corny and campy.  Godzilla is just camp entertainment, and for the people that like that sort of thing it's great, but this movie really tries to not take the route of the usual monster movie.  In most monster flicks, you usually don't care for the characters.  Take Cloverfield for example, I couldn't get into the characters of that movie because the cast pretty much just got cast because of their looks.  I understand that you wanna make the movie pleasing to the eye, but don't sacrifice the characters for that.  The cast of Cloverfield were basically just models and how is the audience (who probably AREN'T models) supposed to relate to these assclowns.  In this movie, you have normal people with normal jobs trying to find the little girl that was taken by the monster.  It's a simple story and it pays of tremendously.  Also one of the things that Cloverfield failed at was making you feel like the monster was a threat at ALL  times.  I can understand that New York is a big place and that the monster won't always, conveniently, be where the main characters are, but the movie loses focus of that and at the end of the movie you're like \"oh yea this is a monster film...I forgot\"  In this movie, the presence of the monster is ALWAYS apparent, the monster isn't always attacking the people of South Korea, but you KNOW he (or she for all I know) is there.  They do this by cutting back to where the monster keeps  the girl (and eventually the little boy).  So the monster's presence is always apparent.  Another thing I liked was how at the end, when the monster is finally defeated, you feel that the main characters actually accomplished something by killing it.  It's something that's not been apparent in monster movies in forever.  That's what it needs to feel like, like they accomplished something and that they finally eliminated the threat.  Which brings me to the sequel (with a different director and different cast, most probably), how in THE HELL are you going to make a sequel and have it not be just about the corniest and most contrived bullshit ever.  You'd think that after the events of this movie, that the government of Korea would be more CAREFUL about how they handle toxic chemicals.  I just can't wrap my head around that, this movie doesn't NEED a sequel. The monster is dead,  there's no logical room for a sequel there.  What are you going to do???  Drop more chemicals in the river????  Again, won't the Korean government (in the movie...DUH) be more careful of how they handle toxic chemicals after this.  If it was the same director and cast, then I'd give it a chance, but I have absolutely NO hope for the sequel and it'll probably be camp entertainment like Godzilla and that pisses me off.  And don't even get me STARTED on the fucking American remake.  Christ almighty get your own ideas for FUCK'S SAKE!!!!  GODDAMNIT!!!!  FUCKITALL!!!  Anyway, the cast of this movie is so great.  They all very distinctive personalities and are likeable in their own way.  Song Kang-ho is so awesome, though.  I can't stress enough how great Song is.  I'll never get old of saying this, but he's one of the best and most diverse actors around.  He's just as great at comedy as he is at drama.  He's one of the best at that, because not every great dramatic actor can do comedy (IE: Edward Norton) and not every great comedic actor can do drama (and I mean consistently...Adam Sandler and Eddie Murphy have only done a couple, and not very consistently at that and Jim Carrey doesn't count cause his comedic style is hit and miss for me, same thing with Robin Williams).  So that makes Song's diversity as an actor all the more impressive, because he can really convey a whole set of emotions just by his facial expression.  Look at this movie (when he first appears at least) and look at Thirst, two completely different versions of the same actor, but he's still excellent in both roles.  Song is just incredible and he's great here.  But in reality, the cast is really great in this movie, especially the girl who gives a really good performance despite it being a very challenging role for someone that age.  With that said, this movie is excellent, probably the best monster movie of the past decade, which isn't saying much.

The creature was interesting, (though I can't help but picture one of the mounts from the old Golden Axe arcade game whenever I see it.  The purple one that attacked by thrashing its tail.), and although the events that led to its creation seemed awfully far-fetched, it turns out that scene was based on an actual event that took place.  Of course, no mutant monsters resulted from the real thing, but it just goes to show that truth can indeed be stranger than fiction sometimes.  And despite the gripes I have, (see below) the film still had good pacing, coupled with enough tension and inventiveness to keep your interest.\n\n*SPOILER WARNING*\nNow for the parts that bugged me.  There were a lot of loose ends that were never tied up.  The whole \"virus\" sub-plot alone was rendered both confusing and pointless to a degree, when it was determined there likely wasn't any virus at all.  (Yet they still drilled into the hero's head, looking for it?!  And on that note, since there was no virus, what was there to explain the hero's utter resistance to the anaesthetic he was injected with?)  And there was strong evidence against there being a virus, long before they started using that \"agent yellow\" gas against the creature (and the protesters gathered nearby). I understand that last bit was probably a historical commentary of sorts, political/student demonstrations and all that, but it seemed a clumsy way to go about it.  It felt forced.  And speaking of the gas, why were some people dropping over dead from breathing it, while others (namely: the main characters) seemed largely unaffected?  ESPECIALLY since the gas was supposed to \"eliminate all biologicals\" within its radius?  There were other things that irked me a bit, but they were minor in comparison.\n\nYet even all of that wasn't enough to override the fact that this is still a very enjoyable movie at its core.

The creators won't mind, the film did huge buisness in native Korea and the UK makes up a small fraction of money made, but it feels weird that an intelligent and equally fun monster-mash can't compete with sluggish blockbusters like [i]X-Men 3[/i] and [i]Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest [/i]in the Western Box-Office. Hell even the tiresome wrestling farce [i]Nacho Libre[/i] made more money in the same year.\nThe fact it's foreign and has the Friday night crowds biggest fear (Subtitles!!! Run for the hills!!!) probably account for some of the film's financial failure but really that only goes to show what a narrow minded world we live in.\nThe story isn't any more complex than normal blockbusting fare (indeed compared to the Pirates movies it's like an 80's DTV action flick) but it has alot more in the way of depth than most of it's kind. Based around a family of five, the plot consists of the group attempting to retrieve a member stolen away from them by a giant mutated creature that has been spawned due to the dumping of dangerous chemicals. Really in a nutshell that's it, the plot thickens and the english title does become quite apt, but overall thats the most you have to get your head around.\nThe creatures past is somewhat vague and the filmmakers present the simplest explanations and conclusions but overall it shouldn't bother the audience much, and is made even more forgiving by the fact we have for the most part a solid set of 3-D characters. Kang-ho-song is brilliant as the lazy and underachieving father, who due to a mistake on his own part see's his daughter taken by the giant menace. He convey's a real sense of redemption and made for a sympathetic lead. The support is also superior in quality, the highlight actually being young Ah-sung-Ko who plays the unfortunate family member. Her time in the monster's domain is heartfelt and engages the audience on every level. If her role hadn't been played as well as Ah-sung-Ko does, the film would have been significantly weaker. The rest of the family aren't as unique but manage to develop a decent set of characters, and the chemistry is often wonderful between the clan.\nThe creature himself can't rival Hollywood effects but at times he does look damned good. A little to cartoon like to scare but the way he disposes of his victims and the build-up to several attack sequences more than compensate. Indeed when the monster first rears his slimey head about 15 minutes in, it's for a wonderfully shot and breathtaking attack scene. I have debated in my head if this is a good thing or not (the movie never tops this section) but at the time everyone I watched it with had their eyes glued to the screen.\nThe comedy elements in The Host don't gel as well as one might expect. The humour usually slapstick occasionaly comes from nowhere and interrupts an otherwise powerful or suspenseful scene. Some of the writing is well done, but overall the film is awkward in it's presentation of jokes and light hearted moments.\nThe Host isn't perfect, at around two hours it does feel to long, and in the middle section the pacing slows and does the movie no favours. Still the beggining is for the most part great and the end sequence provides plenty of adrenaline and excitement, along with a surprisingly morose and depressing finish.\nThere are clear political undertones in The Host and for the most part director Joon-ho-Bong handles them well. I expect these themes will fly over the heads of the usual blockbuster viewers, but I and several others that I know really appreciated them. I guess the biggest compliment I can pay The Host is that is respects the audience, something that fewer and fewer films do these days. Indeed it can be taken on surface level as just another action movie, but those who choose to look at the picture this way are missing out as the movie also comes with some good performances, likeable characters and a message at it's heart.

That's right, you heard me.  Don't read ANY more.  Critics have simultaneously built up and destroyed chances of this Korean monster film ever finding a mainstream American audience.  A pity, really.  Believe me when I say that \"The Host\" is an acquired taste-- certainly NOT living up to expectations like unto traditional, B-grade shlock fests.  There's practically no build up to the creature's reveal, very little reliance on special effects, a predominence of acting (i.e. character drama over thrills), and an unbelievably overbearing political undercurrent, particularly in the film's latter half, as one of our sympathetic characters is subjected to a series of invasive scientific \"tests\" at the behest of the American government.  The conclusion is a stark contrast to early comedic moments, especially considering the material.  Cheesy one-liners are not to be found anywhere, and our heroes are far from plucky and endearing.  Face it, this is a hard film to swallow considering the story: a strange mutated fish creature manages to kidnap several unsuspecting victims, carrying them to his lair to feed.  Yeah, sounds cheap.

That might have worked to, seeing as how the military seems to have almost no concern for catching/destroying the creature at all, and are much more concerned with an alleged virus that the monster is \"the host\" to. One would think that catching the creature would be their best chance at finding more out about this virus, but then our heroes wouldn't have much to do, now would they?

That\u0092s my best guess, but all the critics are calling it a freak-out monster-flick. Let me tell you, I laughed more than cringed, was more disappointed than engrossed, and still don\u0092t understand the intentions of the creators. But I can make one thing pleadingly clear; The Host has nothing on Jaws\u0085[/center]\r\n[center] [/center]\r\n\r\n[center]Near the tourist-cluttered shores of a Korean river, an unconventional clan of snack-bar workers reside. Toward the sewers and beneath the bridge naps a monster; always helps customer demand. Park Gang Du (Kang-ho Song), father of the interestingly more mature Park Hyun-seo (Ah-Sung Ko), mans the riverside junk-food emporium during the afternoon, on any normal day. But to his sleepy, indifferent surprise, a slick, blood curdling, fish-like, dragon-being (See how hard this thing is to describe) emerges from the water; a mutated creation of dumped chemicals from a nearby laboratory. Now, when the youngest is taken, Park Gang Du and the rest of his family fight through governmental extermination, a few character flaws, oh, and not to mention, the enormous, flesh-eating, Godzilla-knockoff to get her back alive. [/center]\r\n[center] [/center]\r\n\r\n[center]Critics thrive upon films such as The Host. Films that don\u0092t stick to a mold, that tatter boundaries and set restrictions. They feel obligated, or really just content with praising a film, such as this one, because it\u0092s so distinctive. The Host is an intelligent film, I can\u0092t deny it that compliment, due not only to the political implications it makes against SARS and government regulation but also because of it\u0092s handle on the monster-movie, which they so readily and steadily parody.[/center]\r\n[center] [/center]\r\n\r\n[center][url=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/host/gallery.php?page=4&size=lores&nopop=1\"][img]http://images.rottentomatoes.com/images/movie/gallery/1169392/photo_05.jpg[/img][/url][/center]\r\n[center] [/center]\r\n\r\n[center]The movie does have its segments of success as a frightener, the opening rampage being the most visionary and staggering, but even this sequence has noticeable flaws. Unlike Jaws or other closely categorized films, The Host unveils its antagonist too quickly. The filmmakers seem rushed, intent on showboating their CG marvel without any needed buildup. It\u0092s almost laughable how the monster abruptly makes his debut, and the film would have been better off creating a climax where we see it fully, first hiding it in corners or in the shadows where we begin drowning in anticipation.[/center]\r\n[center] [/center]\r\n\r\n[center]Comedy is also something that The Host plays with unsparingly, allowing jokes to pour into dramatic scenes where the audience is in limbo over whether to bust out laughing or not to. In truth, the performances are quirky enough to make some of the gags work, but only in the beginning. By the end, it just becomes irritating and distracting from the terror-undertow. Still, the conclusion is touching, the effects used advantageously, and it\u0092s one hell of an entertaining picture. Smart in a sense, with its satiric know-how and willingness to be something different, but all these layers just don\u0092t mesh. The Host just ends up disorienting, a mess of ideas that could have been assembled in a much more effective way\u0085[/center]\r\n[center] [/center]\r\n\r\n[center][size=4]In Short[/size][/center]\r\n[center]:fresh: :fresh: :fresh: [/center]\r\n[center]An entertaining and smart, but confusing jumble of genres[/center]\r\n\r\n[center][b]Who I Liked:[/b] Kang-ho Song, who plays the lethargic, immature parental figure is funny and in some ways, heroic.[/center]\r\n[center][b]Best:[/b] Opening chase along the riverbank and the political playfullness.[/center]\r\n[center][b]Worst:[/b] Comedy, which sets this film apart but also ruins the grittiness and intensity of the horror.[/center]\r\n[center] [/center]"}, {"date": "Aug 02, 2007", "score": 4, "text": "The Host is a good monster movie and it doesn't suck like Godzilla, nor is it as strange to the American palate as other Korean movies like Oldboy, Save the Green Planet!, or Rob The Gas Station."}, {"date": "Aug 01, 2007", "score": 5, "text": "The rare film that can literally turn laughter into tears in the blink of an eye.

Actually, leaving some of these questions to the viewer's imagination may have been a good thing.  The movie actually starts out with a bang.  At around the 15 minute mark the monster, in its entirety, is already wreaking havoc.  You actually end up feeling sorry for the main characters at this point as well.  Ingenious.  This movie also does have a pretty good and emotional ending.    Where this movie lacked in my opinion was the hour in the middle.  It moved really slow and it dragged at times with the monster only making short appearances for seconds at a time.  Oh, in case you are wondering, this movie isn't that gory or scary at all, so if you're in the mood for those things stay away from this film.</p><p>The acting is pretty good.  Kang-ho Song flourishes emotionally with his character while Hae-il Park does a nice job as well.  The few English speaking actors were pretty lame though.  It felt like they were just reading right off the script.</p><p>This is probably the element of the film that most people will want to know about.  The CG.  Well, the monster is actually done pretty well and only looks really fake at only a few parts.  You also get some nice cinematography at times the monster is on screen, allowing you to actually get a good grasp of the creature, unlike other films that give you only quick glimpses until the end of the film.</p><p>Overall this movie is above average, but it wasn't anything really spectacular.

I can think of many movies involving giant creatures that don\u0092t amount to any bit of entertainment value at all. Then again, there are a decent amount of these movies that are able to knock your socks off. Joon-ho Bong\u0092s [i]The Host[/i] doesn\u0092t knock my socks off per se, but the film is one of the most entertaining monster flicks to come around in ages.\n\nBong\u0092s creature, as it emerges from Seoul\u0092s Han River, is a feast for the eyes. This is one of the most unusual creations in horror film history. But amazingly the creature doesn\u0092t take on too much of a life of its own. While [i]The Host[/i] is a monster movie, the monster doesn\u0092t end up being the only thing worth watching in the film. Still, the film knows how to perfectly use this monster and is able to create some great thrills along the way.\n\nThe Park family that the film revolves around gives the dysfunctional family motif some new charm. I like that the film has characters such as Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) being among the film\u0092s heroes. While most American monster flicks have some fresh faced young actor playing the hero, it is nice to seem a frumpy everyday kind of guy take the helm. Plus you have some other great characters in this family. I especially liked Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae), a female archery medallist. And Gang-Du\u0092s daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-Sung Ko), who offers up a really great performance as a girl trapped in the monsters den.\n\nThere are two problems I had with [i]The Host[/i]. The first being the humor. Yes the movie is funny when it needs to be, and this humor succeeds marvelously. But the film still has its moments where the humor seems out of place. Such as the moment where the family is mourning Hyun-seo\u0092s capture by the monster. I know that people react differently with a lose in their family, but their reaction was ridiculous and over the top. I also had a problem with how the creature at times would come off as an awe-inspiring creation rather than a menacing one. Seeing it do its acrobatics felt awkward in this film. \n\nOther than that, [i]The Host[/i] is one of the biggest surprises I\u0092ve had this year. It is a fun film with a lot of thrills and chills. The movie might not register well with some viewers, and I completely understand that. But for those who are looking for a good monster flick, which [i]The Host[/i] essentially is, give this film a viewing.[/font]\n[/left]\n[/center]"}, {"date": "Jul 30, 2007", "score": 5, "text": "Its a great monster movie that really makes one remember the old godzilla and king kong.

Well, I did get a couple of these things, yet, when the movie ended, I felt strangely unsatisfied. The film had substance to it that every monster movie shoud have, however, there was just something different about it. Was it the monster? The action? Or, maybe it was because there contained a family dramatic tension to it as we contemplated the strange plot.[/color][/size]\n[size=3][color=#ff0000][/color][/size] \n\n[size=3][color=red]The story centers on the dysfunctional Park family, who is introduced to us in dire poverty as they run a small snack joint next to Han River. Park Hee - Bong, an elderly man around his 60's, not only runs the place, but also lives with his entire family. His oldest son, Gang - Du, is a lazy, forgetful, even childish character who is unemployed and whose wife left him. Nam - il, the youngest son, is a drunk with a foul - mouth and has it hard getting a job. Nam - joo, the only daughter, is possibly Hee - Bong's pride and joy, as she applies in sport competitions as a first rate archer. There peace is destroyed one ordinary day, as a monster (a cross between a lizard and a fish) splashes out from the river and starts crunching down on innocent tourists as they run desparately. For the Park family, their youngest member and daughter of Gang - Du, a teenage girl called Hyun - seo, gets snatched by the creature and dragged into the sewers. The government tells witnesses of the tragedy that it was caused by a virus, in which \"the host\" is infact a primary cause of the creature. But, of course, we as the audience know that the origin was brought on by two scientists shown in the beginning, dumping a dangerous chemical (phenaldehyde) into the sink, which leads to the Han River. [/color][/size][size=3][color=#ff0000]As the entire country of Korea is in panic over the so called \"virus\", the Parks family take matters into their own hands and try to save Hyun - seo when they find out that she is still alive. [/color][/size]\n \n[size=3][color=red]The monster is created out of standard CGI effects and makes Godzilla look like a loveable toy. As the creature spits out the excess of bones that it can't swallow, I was very much reminded of a lizard. Since Godzilla was nothing but a giant amphibian mutated by radiation from a nuclear explosion, The Host's monster is also a giant animal mutated by a science mistake. More importantly, this creature feature is actually scary, not just on its structure, but by the way it creeps up on its victims.[/color][/size]\n\n[size=3][color=#ff0000]If your expecting a giant blockbuster action packed movie, The Host is not it. Its script acts more like a family drama, then it does as a B sci - fi flick. Which is not saying that makes it bad, just different. There is actual thought that goes into the development of each character, including the monster, as they coexist with the bizarre plot. In a nutshell, The Host is creepy, slimy, disgusting, funny, and just plain strange. I had a great time watching it, and hope that America can take a few pointers from it.[/color][/size]"}, {"date": "Jul 30, 2007", "score": 4.5, "text": "Great horor/monster flick!

This hit from South Korea turned mega domestically in 2006, becoming the highest grossing Korean film in cinematic history that year. The film was seen 13 million times at theatres, in a country with a population just over 49 million. Demographically speaking, just how did they do it!? Well first off, you need to write a politically motivated horror film based on events still fresh in memory. Then you spice it up with some unconventional comedy and drama, hire recognizable actors, throw in about 10 million dollars worth of CGI and voi-la! Movie-ala-profit. Of course, the actual budget of 11 million dollars is very moderate under international standards so one can only assume that a lot of careful planning went into this film. The experience however, seemed very spontaneous and fresh, and it was a lot of fun while it lasted. The political part of it is the semi-anti-American nature of the story; an irresponsible American causes problem, many Koreans suffer, then the Americans overkill resolution. The filmmakers were careful enough to kick their own government as well for their lack of intervention so overall it was justifiable, but the depiction of the U.S. government is still unfavorable nonetheless. How ever that may be, the fun part was watching the family search for their youngest, Hyun-Seo (played by talented little miss Ko Ah-Seong), who is taken by a giant land-crawling mutant fish and held captive in its lair. They believe she is still alive, despite the insistence of authorities who think otherwise, and attempt to hunt down the beast themselves. We're talking a working class family here and not trained hunters, so when the hunt is on a series of seemingly random events occur, you will laugh, get confused, but laugh anyway. At least by the end, all of that eventually lead to a semi-happy ending. Thematically, the film matches that of the early Godzilla films, but what they do better is the realism that went into the creature's physical characteristics. CGI is CGI, but considering the budget they did one hell of a good job. Sure gave me nightmares. . .

It is a monster movie, but far from a conventional one: It is mostly about a dysfunctional family and how the appearance of carnivorous sea creatures disrupts their daily routine. It is a horror film, a comedy, a social satire and a family drama all at once; sometimes the synthesis works, sometimes it doesn'[/color][color=white]t, but [i]The Host[/i] is always interesting.[/color]\n \n[color=white]The film opens with a scientist pouring a large amount of formaldehyde down the drain in his lab. The chemicals seep into a South Korean river and have spawned giant amphibious monsters that eat people whole. We meet Gang-du (Kang-ho Song), a dim-witted man who runs a snack hut with his elderly father (Hie-bong Byeon) and his young daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko). They live on the river where those nasty creatures reside and one of them makes away with Hyun-seo. Panic erupts as the government attempts to quarantine anyone who has encountered one of the monsters. Our protagonists escape from the clutches of the evil doctors who want to run tests on them and recede into the sewers of Korea to find Hyun-seo, who is still alive in one of the monster's nests.[/color]\n \n[color=white]All of this unfolds at a brisk pace\u0097it is exciting, suspenseful and entertaining, and it recalls classic monster movies like [i]Creature from the Black Lagoon[/i] and [i]Jaws.[/i] But the flow of the film is interrupted by several strange episodes. For example, when Gang-du and his family are mourning the disappearance of Hyun-seo, they become so emotionally distraught that they fall into a heap on the floor and clamor and climb atop one another. Is this intended to be funny? If anything, it's awkwardly staged and positioned. Later, Gang-du is captured by the men in biohazard jumpsuits and is given a lobotomy. It's a grim scene, but later Gang-du seems to have been completely unaffected by the treatment.[/color]\n \n[color=white]Maybe I'm nitpicking. [i]The Host[/i] is the highest-grossing movie in Korea's history, and it's receiving glowing reviews abroad. As a creature feature, it works marvelously: The special effects are great, the action sequences competently edited and shot, and the characters are surprisingly well-developed. But the movie simply has too much on its plate: As a comedy it's not that funny, as satire it's erratic, and as a drama it's often too bleak (the ending, for instance, is a total downer).

There was way too much comedy for this movie to be taken seriously, the graphics for the monster were...in a mixture of bad and very good so maybe good is the word I'm looking for, and I just feel like half of the movie was really cheesy.

An American scientist orders his Korean employee to dispose of at least 50 bottles of formaldahyde into the river Han.  The toxic chemicals end up creating a mutated amphibious fish creature that is roughly the size of a large bus that goes on a killing spree one nice afternoon eating dozens of picknickers.  In the process, the youngest member of a family is stolen away by the monster.  The rest of the movie is about this family attempting to get her back.\n\nThe movie seems to be more than just a monster movie.  The Americans have created, through their irresponsibility, a monster enemy that terrorizes Korea.  But, to make matters worse, the American government then declares that the monster is the carrier of a deadly virus, and order various biochemical agents dropped on it, as well as quarantine everyone who had been in close proximity to the monster.  We eventually learn the Americans have made this part up, and that there is no virus.  The critique seems to be that America has created its own enemies, and now rather than fight that enemy head on, uses the existence of the enemy to create a phantom enemy through propaganda. \n\nBut the movie is mainly a monster movie, and as a monster movie, it has its pluses and minuses.  The monster is shown running along the river, in broad daylight, towards a crowd of people, knocking them aside and eating them as he runs.  That was fairly terrible in its own way.  And the few times we see the monster, it is interesting.  But most of the movie is devoted to the family, their agony, their mission to rescue the youngest daughter/niece/granddaughter, and how the mission transforms them from selfish, bumbling misfits, to courageous heroes.  So why didn't I like the movie?  I didn't like the movie because it seemed too slow in places where it should've picked up the pace, and I never found the story of the monster all that exciting to begin with.  The political commentary was interesting, and original, and fit with the Asian monster movie tradition of using the monster as a metaphor for global fear (Godzilla, for instance is traditionally believed to be a collective response to Japanese worries and concerns about nuclear power and Hiroshima).

Kind of badly written, plot didn't really work well.  And the compu graphics were too good to really give it B-movie legitimacy."}, {"date": "Jul 05, 2007", "score": 4.5, "text": "I loved The Host. Really good special effects. If you can track a copy down... you own it to yourself to watch it!"}, {"date": "Jul 05, 2007", "score": 4, "text": "A success on both the large and small-scale. The best monster movie in quite a while."}, {"date": "Jul 05, 2007", "score": 4.5, "text": "Forget every monster movie you have ever seen: the Host wins hands down. Funny, poignant and exciting, this movie is more about the dysfunctional family that combat the mutated fish thingy rather than the monster itself. Similar in style to Q: the Winged Serpent, this nevertheless has a unique style, especially with the colour-saturated tones and the unorthodox way they show the monster in the first ten minutes of the film. I did think they could have dissed the Yanks more for the pollutuon of their river though. Awesome: I insist that everyone see this fantastic movie immediately! ZFK maximum rating."}]
