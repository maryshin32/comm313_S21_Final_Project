This film seems to go through many genres, yet it does so seamlessly.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Apr 24, 2021", "text": "This film begins with the image of a pile of socks drying near the narrow window of Ki-Taek's house. He lives on an \"intermediate floor\", a kind of basement whose view overlooks a trash can where a homeless person urinates. The four family members are constantly dirty, moving between cramped rooms as they search for a free Wi-Fi network in the neighborhood. The description of this family is grotesque, just as the bourgeois description of the Park family will be grotesque. The latter inhabit the spacious house created by a famous architect, where the four members are scattered around the rooms and get bored with all the technology and objects at their disposal. The two cores are identical opposites (father, mother, daughter and son), like the reflection of a mirror.\nDirector Bong Joon-ho moves on to a caricature view of the social classes, whose stratification is represented by the literal structure of the houses - see the rich man's house, the poor's middle floor and a basement, an even more precarious level that will play an important role in the plot. While the Park's wealth makes them naive and ignorant (no curiosity for the world around them due to the ease of their possessions), the protagonists' poverty motivates trickery, the ability to create all possible tricks to ascend socially. It does not take long before families meet and the unemployed manage to infiltrate the wealthy house, one by one, gaining the trust of new employers. The notion of parasitism suggested by the title works perfectly to describe the central conflict.\nThe first half of the narrative is a delightful comic farce. The plans devised by father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter (Park So-dam) and son (Choi Woo-sik) are as simple as they are hilarious, working only thanks to the Park's innocence. The director is not deprived of creating really exaggerated scenes, betting on physical humor and the blows of destiny that contribute to the success of the mission. The viewer needs to show a high degree of indulgence to believe in some of the twists and turns, as well as certain elements of suspense introduced along the way. Joon-ho is much more interested in the symbolic value of the actions and characters than in the verisimilitude of the plot, which becomes an allegorical fable of ants and cicadas, foxes and chickens.\nFortunately, as suspense sets in, Parasite takes the precaution of expanding the social scope and visiting other families in a situation as precarious as that of the protagonists. This is the time to reveal the different ways of dealing with difficulties, so that the parasitism of Ki-Taek and her family is not seen as the only possible way out. The flood scene proves to be particularly effective in affecting the lower floors while preserving the upper floors. Aesthetically, the project demonstrates the pragmatic elegance of the director, who never sacrifices understanding in the name of beauty. The filmmaker proves an excellent mastery of tones, directing the scribe, the touching drama and the dark suspense in different, yet organic and permeable ways.\nFinally, it is not surprising that the narrative leads to tragedy. The script sees violence as the only possible outcome for the clash between extreme poverty and ostentatious wealth, between the boss's hypocritical education (who even likes the employees, despite having a \"subway smell\") and the restrained aggressiveness of the employees. The film builds a time bomb, accentuating differences and social injustices until it explodes in a bloody climax. In this way, it allegorically represents the class struggle, the ideas of possession and appropriation in the contemporary era. It is commendable that the text dedicates a privileged space for cell phones, \"gourmet balconies\", the back rooms - so many elements representative of the times in which we live.\nWhen the son is faced with a serious problem, he tries to put himself in the place of the rich friend: \"What would Min do in this situation?\", he asks. Her sister replies: \"Min would never be in this situation\". Perhaps this is the best summary of the tragicomic discourse, according to which social mobility is an illusion, and Hollywood dreams of affective reconciliation between rich and poor deserve to be ridiculed. For a family to occupy the Park home, the ultimate symbol of success, it is necessary for another family to leave, even if it is by force. To ascend to the top of the pyramid, the only way is war.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Apr 23, 2021", "text": "It has a brilliant premise, clever writing, and a style that's uniquely its own.

The only Korean entertainment I have ever consumed is PUBG. So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched.\n\nParasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house.\n\nThings don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hiding\n\nThe only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal.\n\nParasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is.

I know that the Oscars are one of the most popular events, but let's be honest, everyone who is even a bit interested in the beauty of cinema knows well that the Cannes festival really awards world-class works. For example, last year's winner of the festival \"Parasite\". After watching the movie myself I understood why. Bong Joon-ho is distinguished by extraordinary originality in his movies. \"Snowpiercer\" or \u2018Okja' are pure evidence that this director never repeats himself. He will always surprise us with a new story, completely different from the others, with something astounding about it. His new work \"Parasite\" also belongs to this canon, but this time Bong Joon-Ho presents us with a story that surpasses all previous sensational achievements of the Korean. \n\nThis should be a review, not a spoiler, so I will try to describe the plot of this masterpiece as simple as possible. Let's start with the fact that the main characters are a poor Korean family (parents and two young adult children) living in a musty basement. The movie starts with a great misfortune, the wi-fi password was changed in a local area and the family loses access to the Internet. At some point we can all relate to this little \u2018catastrophe'. Sooner or later thanks to a friend's recommendation the family's son, finds a job as an English tutor to a teenage girl from a wealthy family. He quickly starts implementing a plan that will allow him to get his sister and parents to work for the rich. At this point, it felt like the entire movie was supposed to be a comedy of contrasting poor and rich families, and seeing the poor struggling to stay afloat. But don't worry the movie is about more than that.\n\nMost of the things that happen as the story unfolds are unpredictable. The unconventional creator doesn't give everything up on the plate right away. Parasite starts off as a comedy, we have a lot of black humor here, incredible plot twists, the scenes are erratic and the tension keeps growing. It is impossible to guess what's going to happen at the very end or even in the next few moments. And on top of all this, Bong Joon-Ho shows us one of the biggest issues of the world: the differences between rich and poor. \n\nNot only the script and direction in Parasite is excellent. The whole thing looks great in every possible way. The shots and music are a real feast for the senses, and the way the camera is operated makes us get to know the Park house like our own pocket. In addition, we also get a small look on a poor Korean town, which in my opinion may interest the European viewer. Also the cast of this movie did a stunning job. \n\nParasite is told in a modern, poetic, light and daring way. This piece of art devours the spectator, does not cause any problems with assimilation, and at the same time is an absolutely refined work at the highest level. In my opinion everyone should watch this movie. It hides a lot of variety that you will not notice at first glance. It has an intriguing story, combines humor with seriousness and the both family's cannot be seen as good or bad. \"Parasite\" is an extremely courageous movie that touches on social stratification, and it does it in a daring manner it amuses and moves.

At the beginning of the movie, the focus is on a Kim family of four in the basement of Seoul. Mom and dad are unemployed, kids are out of school. One day, Kim family's son was hired to be a tutor for the daughter of a rich family, Park Family and then he tried to let his family pretend as the highly qualified person and they successfully parasitized in the rich family while the rich family is quite unaware.\nThis is a very novel movie.

I enjoy all the actor's performance they do a great job in emphasizing the little nuances which make each of the personalities unique and I would say there is no redundant lens. In this film each scene, in the beginning, is the preparation for the following plot.\nAt the end of the movie, \"the poor\" finally becomes \"the rich\" and leads a good life through their efforts, but all this is imagined by \"the poor\".

It's then a story of how things can escalate when you get into a situation you aren't in control of to begin with and the stakes keep raising. There are no glaring problems with the plot or characters, unless (I'm told) you happen to be familiar with South Korean culture. And the film does a decent job of making you care about most of the characters in it as it appropriately develops most of the characters in it so you can understand them as people.\n\nThe problem comes in when you really start to pay attention to the characters and the decisions that they make. At it's core it poses the assumption that if you give someone an inch, they will take a mile. Which isn't unreasonable, until I add in that the mile would include driving over people, friends included, then it's a whole lot less reasonable and is only believable if we are talking about psychopaths.\n\nIn the same way while the situation might initially seem understandable you are doomed if you ever ask yourself the question; but would you? If you and your family were in a desperate situation would you risk it all for more when the chance of you getting busted is actually pretty high? Probably not. If you were to seemingly succeed, would you repeat the process? Well, maybe since you were daft enough to try it again, but really, why would you? The film makes no effort to explain why they keep choosing to escalate the situation when they seem to move out of the most desperate situation immediately after acquiring the first opportunity, which was given to them legitimately. Instead they plough ahead taking risk after risk, then pretty soon the characters seem to forget how precarious their position is and make several obviously terrible decisions which act as a catalyst for further escalating situations. Culminating into an entirely avoidable situation.\n\nThe biggest problem of all is that the means they use to go about setting up these further opportunities draw attention to how wicked they are as people and really sets you against them despite their own struggles. You then spend much of the film rooting for them to fail as much as you are hoping for everything to turn out alright, because although they were clearly desperate, it's equally apparent that they are bad people who don't hesitate to put other people in a situation as desperate as they have been in, so long as it's not them. I get the sense that this is supposed to be a duality within the film, but when one side completely overpowers the other, it doesn't work at all. The various bad circumstances that afflict the characters in no way comes even close to justifying their actions against others and just cements that fact that they are people who ultimately deserve to lose.\n\nThat being said, the acting, which I have seen criticised, isn't bad. It's not Hollywood A-list but then placing that kind of expectation on them is unreasonable and they easily outperform some actors/actresses in Hollywood who have had repeated work in the industry. The music is perfectly crafted to enhance the experience and it's clear no expense nor effort was sparing in the sets. It's an experience that is only harmed by how obscene the choices the characters make and keep making.\n\nWhile you are watching you could become engrossed enough to forget these kinds of details and considerations, and if you can do that you will enjoy it. If you have an eye for the particulars however, Parasite is fundamentally no different from a B-list horror movie where the situation only happens because of continued awful decisions on the part of the main cast. I don't feel that this fundamentally a bad movie, despite how much I may have gone on about its flaws, but it's not something you are every likely to watch twice and I seriously doubt it's something that will be remembered as anything other than 'that foreign film that won best picture that one time'", "score": 2.5}, {"date": "Jan 19, 2021", "text": "Fantastic and creepy-as-heck.

The plot of the film is also one where you wouldn't necessarily think it would appeal to the Academy: a poor family of four living in the underground struggles to survive. When the son gets the opportunity to work for a very wealthy family, their situation suddenly turns around. As a result, events turn upside down.\n\nContrary to other mainstream films, in which the main - supporting scheme is usually clearly followed through, in Parasite the entire cast shines at the same high level. All of them act in absolute top form and give their so different characters that certain something. If you had to pick a stand out, it would be Kim Ki-taek as the father of the poor family. His performance is subtle and funny for long stretches, but once he comes out of his shell, he impresses with a lot of wisdom and unpredictability. But the real hero of the film is director Bong Joon Ho. Known in his home country for years as a borderline brilliant filmmaker, he has given Parasite an aura that few could replicate. Not only is the ensemble of actors spot-on, but everything else, from the stirring music to the beautiful set designs and well-chosen dialogue, he has done everything right with this film.\n\nParasite's success should never have come as a big surprise. Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece is one of the most complete films of recent years. Especially the fact that the film initially resembles a comedy and only then lives up to its actual genre of thriller is a unique approach. In parallel, there is also the influence of other genres, such as drama, mystery and even some action. It remains to mention the social criticism that Parasite tries to communicate over its entire 134 minutes. The class differences in South Korea are portrayed very well. Sometimes discreetly, but mostly transparently and very clearly.  This is especially thought-provoking when you watch the film repeatedly and become more aware of this fact.

Releasing on 7th February in the United Kingdom, Parasite has taken the world by storm, and for good reasons. This thriller/comedy is a marvel of modern cinema and undoubtedly one of the best films of the decade, with it already having deservingly won over 13 awards - even breaking Oscar history by taking home 4 awards in one night. \n\nParasite (directed by Bong Joon-ho) follows the lives of the Kim family, showing the harsh realities of living in poverty and the slums of the city. The son, Ki-woo (portrayed by Choi Woo-shik), becomes the leader of the movement in his family to improve their life after being given a symbol of luck by a family friend. Ki-woo takes over as an English tutor for the Park family \u2013 a rich, powerful household who the Kims are able to leech off of in order to work their way up in society. The na\u00efve head-of-household Mrs Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) is soon blindsided by the entirety of the Kim family, as their plans to remove the original workers of the household unfold successfully. Up until this point, Parasite appears to be quite a light-hearted film, however, things soon take a turn for the unexpected. \n\nUpon watch, it is clear why this film has so quickly been treasured by the majority of those that have seen it. Details as small as the film being separated by two specific acts are the reason it is so successful as a movie. It provides twists and turns that are almost impossible to predict for even the most keen-eyed viewers and film critics, even switching the entire genre of the movie when you least expect it. The transition between comedy and thriller is seamless and makes for extremely easy viewing, as two hours pass by without hesitation or a wanting for the film to hurry up at any point. A strong point of this movie is definitely the way the events are laid out. In most movies where action or horror takes place, we see this theme and set of sequences being dragged out across the entirety of the movie, often making it repetitive and occasionally boring after it having been shown already. Parasite however, successfully places the \u2018action' throughout the film in specific places. These points of conflict or climax are skillfully placed to ensure that they don't become meaningless throughout the course of the film. \n\nAnother point of discussion is the soundtrack of this cinematic wonder \u2013 more specifically the opening theme of the movie. Although the song is a simple piece on piano, it becomes very symbolic of the film as a whole, especially after watching it and then revisiting the song. The theme consists of an upwards ladder of notes, perhaps representing the climb the Kim's attempt to make in society through the Parks, with the Kims living in the slums and the Parks in uptown luxury. With a main image in this movie being stairs, it's no wonder why this song has been made similar to a climbing sound; ideas of climbing up the social ladder, with those high up in society being above and those lower are below. Despite being a simple piece, the emotions it can draw out of those that truly listen to it are powerful and I encourage all that have seen this movie to give this song another listen. Along with the main theme, Parasite's entire soundtrack is able to perfectly capture the tonal shifts of the film and add to the overall effect of some of its most powerful scenes. \n\nIf you haven't seen Parasite already, I highly implore you to do so and hope that these common praises of the film encourage you further. This movie is one of the rare cases where a film is clearly going to be the best for years to come and be something to stick with you as a significant moment in cinematic history. Being the first foreign film in history to win Best Picture at the Oscars (and deservedly so), Parasite truly is a masterpiece of modern cinema and should be what people take notes on when asking how to make cinematic history.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of the \u2018upstairs/downstairs' genre, especially because, aside from the period costumes, I find these shows or movies sluggish and elitist. However, what makes Parasite stand out is that it plays to the inner sadist in both societal merits, allowing for some outlandishly hilarious character-based humor. The Kims are the low-income optimists who dream of moving to an elevation bigger than themselves and the Parks are the naive, money-grabbing, spoiled snobs who rob from the poor and mock their \u2018old basement smell'. The movie also combines said humor with the more intense gritty Sam Peckinpah style violence and thought-provoking drama, to a point where the quality of writing goes into Coen Brothers territory.

The plot is all sleek, smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places; the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic. Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich, and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins. It also switches genres deftly; from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama/thriller of the second half. Other genre tropes are cleverly employed - especially hinting at aspects of horror and science-fiction, nodding more than once to HG Wells' War Of The Worlds amongst others.

Raising his game with riveting and nail-biting sequences that rival, if not eclipse, the best of any English-language picture, Bong transfixes audiences regardless of background, race or social status, for a breath-taking and genre-bending 132 minutes that descends deep into the belly of Seoul's semi-basement dwellings in a metaphori-, no, allegorical movie miracle. Demonstrating commanding craftmanship with his scintillating, near-perfect execution, the South Korean director is not the only talent deserving of 'a glass of soju', as the oustanding ensemble cast shine brightly in this black comedy thriller, spearheaded by Bong's male muse Song Kang-ho, and dynamic camerwork from fellow countryman Hong Kyung-pyo completes the impossibly satisfying package, shooting every frame so visually rich in prescient themes that resonate with today's troubled times flawlessly.

It stars Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, Jang Hye-jin, and Lee Jung-eun. The film follows the members of a poor family who scheme to become employed by a wealthy family by infiltrating their household and posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.  I'm gonna say the m-word: masterpiece. Say it with me. MASTERPIECE! How does such a prestigious film critic, such as I, convey when a film is unexpected, unpredictable, and above all else, brilliant in ways that feel like I just showed you an episode of Rick & Morty, and therefore your 3rd eye has transcended the laws of basic human anatomy, and opened. Do you think I'm the \"towering-inferno-of-physical-and-mental-perfection\" that cried masterpiece? I'll probably do my best to convince (coerce) you that Parasite truly is a masterpiece. Just trust me on this one, please. Bong has made several films about class, including Snowpiercer and Okja, but Parasite may be his most daring examination of the structural inequity that has come to define our modern-day world. It's a tonal juggling act that first feels like a satirical comedy of manners that showcases a group of lovable con artists off a very wealthy family of awkward eccentrics. But then, Bong takes a hard right turn at exactly the middle of the film that asks us what we're watching and practically warns us that there will be blood. Can the poor really just step into the world of the rich? The second half of the film is one of the most daring things I've seen in years storywise. The film constantly threatens to come apart; to take one convoluted turn too many in ways that sink the project, but Bong holds it all together, and the result is absolutely breathtaking to behold. Kim Ki-woo and his family live on the edge of poverty. They fold pizza boxes for a delivery company to make some quick cash, steal wi-fi from the coffee shop nearby, and leave the windows open when the neighborhood is being fumigated to deal with their own infestation. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when a friend offers to recommend him as an English tutor for a girl he's been working with, as the friend has to go out of the country for a while. The friend is in love with the young girl and doesn't want another tutor to also fall in love with her. Why he trusts Kim Ki-woo is pretty much the only flaw that I can find in the film. Then again I don't have 20/20 vision, so I might need the help of Dora the Explorer. Our hero changes his name to \"Kevin\" and begins tutoring Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso), who immediately falls in love with him, of course. Kevin has a much deeper plan. He's going to get his whole family into this house. He quickly convinces the mother Yeon-kyo, the excellent Jo Yeo-jeong, that the son of the house needs an art tutor, which allows Kevin's sister \"Jessica\" to enter the picture. Before long, mommy and daddy are in the Park house too, and it seems like everything is going perfectly for the Kim family. The Parks seem to be happy too. And then EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, changes. The screenplay for the film has rightfully gotten a lot of attention as it's one of those clever twisting and turning tales for which the screenwriter gets the most credit (Bong and Han Jin-won, in this case), but this is very much an exercise in visual storytelling that reaffirms Bong as a master. Working with the incredible cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and an A-list design team, Bong's film is captivating with every single composition. The clean, empty spaces of the Park home contrasted against the tight quarters of the Kim home isn't just symbolic, it's visually stimulating without ever calling full attention to itself. And there's a reason the Kim apartment is halfway underground; they're caught between worlds, stuck in the growing chasm between the haves and the have-nots. The film is marvelously entertaining in terms of its story, but there's also so much going on underneath about how the rich use the poor to survive in many ways. Suffice to say, the wealthy in any country survive on the labor of the poor, whether it's the housekeepers, tutors, and drivers they employ, or something much darker. Kim's family will be reminded of that chasm and the cruelty of injustice in ways you couldn't possibly predict. The social commentary of the film inevitably leads to chaos, but it never feels like a teacher teaching you something. It's somehow, and I'm still not even really sure how, both joyful and depressing at the same time. Stick with me here. The film is so perfectly calibrated that there's joy to be had in just experiencing every confident frame of it, but then that's tempered by thinking about what Bong is unpacking here and saying about the society that we live in, especially with the perfect, absolutely haunting final scenes.

Bong says he was inspired to write Parasite back in 2013 when he was challenged to write a play. He used his experience tutoring to a wealthy family back in his 20s. He was also inspired by The housemaid, a story of two French house helpers that murdered their employers. It was the first foreign film to win the best picture at the academy awards.\nJust as the name of the film suggests, parasitism is one of the significant themes featured in the movie. However, the movie doesn't make it clear as to who are the parasites. Society today has made us believe that due to the difference in social classes, it is always the less fortunate in the community that feeds off the wealthy. Based on that, the parasites in this film are Moon-gwang, her husband, and the Kim family. One could also argue that the Parks were the parasites because they couldn't do anything for themselves and were just dependent on the loyalty and skills of their workers. However, the more significant pest seems to be the class inequality where the Kims desire the good life that comes with being productive and the Parks look to get more by always being away on business trips and not doing actual work.\nClass is one of the major themes that are evident throughout the movie, showcasing the enormous gap between the Parks and the Kims. When the film begins, we are introduced to two families who are in totally different social classes. The Kims that reside downtown in a shanty apartment depend on free Wi-Fi to access the internet. The family is displayed to have nothing but themselves. On the other hand, the wealthy Park family appears to have quite a lot of money to spend. They have invested it in employing helpers to assist them in their daily activities like tutoring their children or taking care of their house.\nWhen the Kims secure jobs at the wealthy Park family, they discover just how some people live life luxuriously compared to their lives, so they spend their entire time craving the park's wealth. In the movie, wealth is depicted as something that makes someone brighter and more delightful. However, money is also described as making one lose their sense of accountability and making them lower their guard. This is clear when the Parks don't realize that all their employees are related.\nCapitalism is another theme that was heavily depicted by Bong Joon-ho in this film. The class struggle is embedded in the inequalities built in a capitalistic system. The Kim family doesn't have many opportunities to develop themselves, as shown when the father was unable to secure any form of employment, and the son had been attempting the exams to go to university in vain. However, Mr. Park has been accorded with a lot of opportunities, one being that he already comes from a wealthy family; he is a well educated, successful businessman. This depicts the two families not according to their abilities, but according to where the capitalist economy places them.\nThe film slowly turns away from comedy, and violence begins. Political and psychological violence is depicted when the Parks invite the Kims into their lives but exclude them greatly in ways that highlight the existing disparities. Perverse violence occurred when the Kim's were occupying the Parks' house when they were away for camping. The Kim family started fighting moon-gwang and her husband, with both parties wanting to be the beneficiaries of the relationship with the Parks, which they believe will save them from hardships in life.\nThe final scene depicts the gruesome violence in the whole film. Moon-gwang is pushed down the stairs by Chung-sook. Ki-woo is hit with a rock by Geun-sae till he loses consciousness. This early violence showcases how the lower classes always turn on each other. Mr Park acted disgusted to the smell of Geun-sae, which sparked rage in Ki-taek who stabbed him. The bloodbath that ended the film was seen when implicit violence of the characters for the political and structural positions came out.\nInfrastructural and environmental collapse is depicted where the entire existence of the poor was based on perils for instance, at the beginning of the film where we are shown the Kims family lives in the dark basement, which was infested with insects. They would keep the window open so they could benefit from the fumigation that was being done in the streets. Another example of their perils was the night there was a rainstorm, and the Parks were forced to come back from their camping trip. Da-song decides to spend a night out in his waterproof tent in their backyard. In contrast, the Kims rush home amidst the heavy rain and find that their street was flooded, and rainwater had mixed up with sewage. Their home is wholly ruined and unlivable, with most of their belongings floating on the water. Here Bong Joon-ho shows that being of a low class isn't about lacking luxuries enjoyed by the rich but a matter of significant vulnerability to diseases, infrastructural and environmental collapse.\nThe whole film is centered around deception, and it is thrilling to see the whole of Kim's family deceiving the parks and getting away with it. They let the Parks think that they were in control, yet they had created a great plan of deceit complete with fake qualifications. It raises the question if people in the lower class have to deceive their way to the top to climb the ladder of societal class.\nIn conclusion, Bong Joon-ho's movie Parasite is a phenomenal movie that speaks of the various things relatable to society today. From a philosophical aspect, it was a great mirror of society and showcased themes that are depicted today.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "May 07, 2020", "text": "Top-notch satire shows director Joon-ho Bong at the height of his art with an eventful, multi-layered tale with several twist, great cinematography and a good ensemble of characters.", "score": 4}, {"date": "May 07, 2020", "text": "The Worst Best Picture Winner in Oscar History.

It's just a masterpiece.", "score": 5}, {"date": "May 04, 2020", "text": "The movie Parasite is a brilliantly shot film that displays the relationship between the working class families and the upper class families in the modern capitalist society. In the plot, the Park family hires lower class workers for jobs like housekeeping, tutoring, and chauffeuring. The Kims family, eager to raise themselves above the level of despairing poverty, find their way into the Parks house by replacing old staff and getting employed. Unbeknown to both the Park and Kim family, the old housekeeper's family, her husband Kun-Sae, actually lived in the basement of the Parks house and survived off of whatever scraps of food and leftovers he could get.\n       There is so much meaning to be unpacked in this film, and we could start with the architecture. The very fact that the previous help had resided in the basement of the house's actual basement shows how these working class families are physically lower than the upper class, as they reside in the dark cemented basement like \"cockroaches\" and rats in sewers. Actually, the way Kun-Sae crawls around and devours his food is similar to that of an animal, as he seems to have forgotten how to function normally. The only way to reach this basement is through a long flight of stairs leading down. Stairs seem to be a significant symbol throughout the film, as the Kim family has to take many long flights of stairs in the city to reach their house, which is also a semi-basement. This visual representation of climbing stairs represents the long journey working class families need to take to reach the upper class or improve their lives. Towards the end of the film, when the father Ki-Tek ends up replacing the old man and living in the house's basement to avoid punishment for murder, and he says \"Each time, I go upstairs [to scavenge for food] I take my life in my hands.\" And this is representative of the struggle working-class families face when they are just trying to survive. \n       There is also a very interesting representation of the upper class as almost Godly. In a scene, Kun-Sae in the basement looks at pictures of Mr. Park hanging all over the wall, and shouts \"Respect! You [Mr. Park] feed me and house me.\" He then explains that he sends him whole sentences in Morse code through the light bulbs to thank him. This is almost parallel to the relationship between man and God, as prayers of thanks are made through specific methods (like codes) for the blessings of life. This presentation seems to be highlighting the extent of class difference between these two types of people, almost saying that it elevates the status of the rich Mr. Park to God and that of the poor and needy Kun-Sae to his servant. In another display to highlight the relationship between the working and upper class, it becomes clear that the \"automatic light bulbs\" that go on when someone walks up the entrance stairs is actually Kun-Sae pressing the buttons for those lights, signifying how man's efforts below generates man's luxury above.\n\tFinally, in reference to the name Parasite, depending on one's analysis both working and rich families can be depicted as parasites, as they both seek to benefit from the other. While the rich want to benefit from the need of the poor for labor and money to favor their lives (quite literally in the end when Mr. Park asked Mr. Kim to fetch the car for his son instead of saving his own daughter's life), the poor want to benefit from the gullibility and wealth of the rich to make money and have better lives.

From river monsters, to end-of-the-world tales, to a pig-like Totoro, Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal. With \"Parasite\" he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film \"Snowpiercer.\"  Bong sums it up best himself when he was described \"Parasite\" as \"a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.\" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. \"Parasite\" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "Apr 28, 2020", "text": "Awesome Movie.

They fold pizza boxes for money and leave the windows open to let the street exterminator's fog kill the cockroaches in their house. The parents have tried to get jobs and have not been hired. Their children have unique skills but have been rejected by the system. This is not an anomaly in our lives, regardless of where we are from. Kevin's (Choi Woo-shik) friend gives the family a scholar's rock, said to bring the family material wealth. It does. There is a stellar scene with them sitting at the table before they all get jobs. They get jobs because they lie about their class. Joon-Ho's argument is that lower class people are just as skilled as upper-class people, if not more, but they are rejected because they do not \"know the right people\". This is a phrase we often hear, especially in business. Good connections go a long way. How are these connections reached? The ending scene, like all lasting art metaphors, must be inferenced. It is a realization of Kevin's that he will never accumulate enough money to save his dad. Joon-Ho is saying that as the rich get richer, a gap widens between them and the poor. My favorite scene is Kevin and his dad laying on mattresses in a gym after their apartment flooded out. They discuss life and how the lack of a plan in life will leave a person's emotions unchanged. If they had a plan and it didn't happen, they would be angry. With no plan, they continue to live unaffected. I believe Joon-Ho is saying that it is hard for the poor to have dreams, because these dreams can be easily dashed. In contrast, the life of an upperclassman is mapped out. Early schooling, college, a career, retirement and death.

The way it's shot, paced, written, acted, and overall executed, is done with sharp precision so that not a single moment feels wasted or pointless.  An overarching theme I noticed throughout the film, which may be entirely subjective, is that being wealthy doesn't denote being smart, and being poor doesn't denote being stupid.  An impoverished family slyly infiltrated a richer one, right under their noses.  \n\nAt first I felt pity for the poor family's life predicament; living in a basement where you constantly see tramps urinating on your property sounds like a life nobody wants.  Yet, as the movie progressed, I began feeling less sympathetic towards them as their plot to infiltrate the family as a means to their own monetary gain was unraveling.  I'll admit, it was clever how they would get one person fired, then recommend one of their family members to replace them, without ever mentioning their relationship to avoid getting caught.  But, essentially, they became criminals.  However, you can see why they'd resort to that.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.\n\nGreed, the desire for materialistic gain, and the hunger to move up socially, can spiral out of control and backfire.  That's what happens to this impoverished family.  Funny enough, by the end of the movie, I'm back on their side sympathizing with them again.

Having walked into this film only watching the trailer once I didn't know what to expect, therefore I was pleasantly surprised by the last 40 minutes, the twists and turns as well as the acting and social commentary, gives Parasite an edge that makes it stand out above other 2019 films. \nThis movie will surely become a classic in the near future and well deserved it will be.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Apr 23, 2020", "text": "Tense, funny, scary, melancholy - this is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time.

But then the plot goes in a really strange direction. The plausibility plummets and strangeness ensues. Seemingly, all this poor family's efforts to be employed by the rich hasn't substantially improved their lives.\n\nThe ending is also bizarre. The parasite in residence goes on a rampage. A bunch of people are stabbed, and it's unclear to me who lived and who died. It's also unclear to me why the father got involved. That insanity didn't seem to advance his interests any; in fact, it's somewhat unclear how their scheme would have been uncovered even if the basement were revealed. But no, the father got involved, seemingly unable to contain his contempt and taking advantage of everyone else being skewered at the time.\n\nThe \"epilogue\" doesn't help much. It shows that the family remain in their same situation, maybe worse. The father is now the great parasite. The son fantisizes (or whatever, unclear how this message is reaching the father) that he'll be rich one day and rescue the father.\n\nThe movie overall isn't fun.

This movie is better than I expected even I already have an extremely high expectation. Given my 50/50 chance to fall asleep during a movie, I didn't even blink as I was so immersed in the story and was anxious to see how things develop.\nEveryone should watch this movie, at least once; I am planning to watch it the second time.\n \nFirst of all, I love socioeconomic contrasting between the extremely rich and the extremely poor, every step of the way - their beliefs, day-to-day life, living environment, outfit, and how they treat others. For this low-income family, they even have to go to this very spot in their tiny restroom to get the free Wifi from an unknown neighbor, but they can be so happy for fighting this kind of thing. However, this wealthy family has so much that they even need a basement to store all of their kimchi. As a person who has lived in both Taiwan and the U.S., I feel like this dynamic is universal, not just applicable not just to South Korea. Given the worsening wealth gaps growing across the globe, the movie portraits something so real that it didn't feel like a comedy.\n \nThe acting is brilliant. All the actors are well-rounded, with great character developments progress as the story evolves. Especially for the son, his evolution was fascinating, from an insecure left-behind young man to feeling getting to something, then felt responsible for killing the maid for his family, even though that was against his will. The dad was incredible. He was willing to do anything for his family, even was humiliated by the boss and boss wife. Deep inside, his self-esteem was his last front-tier, and he couldn't stand people judging his \"lower-class\" smell.\nIt triggered all of his insecurities, and eventually, he killed the boss.\n \nThe scenery was magnificent. There is a contrast between their houses. This elevated mansion, extremely spacious space that everyone has its own space, neat and clean with elegant design. In the meantime, a tiny place next to sewage, with drunk people passing by and pissing all the time. When the water came, it almost feel like their meager existence was ever so fragile, and it is one flood away from being wiped out\n \nThe ending was great, though I felt that is somehow predictable. But I like how it was weaving the son's fantasy and reality.

Rich with style and social commentary \u2018Parasite' presents director Bong Joon-ho in complete control of his craft. \n\nThe cinematography works subtly to convey the rising tension of the film with purposeful slow push-ins on the characters. Even if the audience doesn't at first notice this subtle movement, we subconsciously feel the pressure closing in on the Kim family and a sense of foreboding disaster as their con is at risk of collapse. The film is filled with deliberate long takes, the smooth camera movement shifts the shots creating new compositions and keeps the frame visually interesting without the need to cut. This helps to give more opportunity for characters to share the screen building on the visual representation of their relationships. These long moving shots also function as a method of emphasising the scale of the Parks' house and give the audience the chance to gain a well-constructed sense of the space which is symbolic of the Parks' vast wealth. \n\nThe production design is immaculate and demonstrates a careful attention to detail, both the Park and Kim houses were sets constructed for the film and while they could not be more aesthetically dissimilar, they both feel equally believable. The locations of these two houses are also important, with a not so subtle metaphor the Kim family live down a street in a semi-basement dwelling while the Park house sits atop a hill. This vertical distancing represents both the separation of the families and their respective classes. Through this visualisation we understand that there are physical structures in place enforcing the separation of the classes, while the rich keep moving up, for the poor the uphill battle only gets harder. This idea translates in the story as setbacks for the Kim family negatively compound, forcing them into a downward spiral while the Parks' with their established forward momentum easily transform obstacles into positive opportunity. \n\nBut the movie is more complex than \u2018poor people good, rich people bad' each family possesses both good and bad traits showing a common humanity, aiming the critique towards the system rather than the people within it. The lower class can be viewed as infantilized by their idolisation of the rich, while the upper class may be considered child-like in their naivety towards the struggle of the less fortunate. The two sides of society romanticise aspects of the other, what then separates them is the ease with which the wealthy Park family can dip into that fantasy and return to their privilege while the Kim family are punished for their aspirations and attempt to embrace a more lavish lifestyle outside of their designated class. \n\nIn \u2018Parasite' Bong Joon-ho has carefully crafted a slick and evocative film that through excellent film technique conveys important social themes of the segregation of classes through the systematic structures of society.

However, I don't think this was a 4 star or a 5-star film. With ongoing stigmatization and stereotypes of the lower class and the poor, I did not appreciate the way the poor were portrayed in this film; liars, cheaters, dishonest individuals who cannot make an honest living, who are incapable of challenging upper class intellectually and competing and even exceeding those standards. At first, when he started tutoring, I thought \"wow, he's a got a chance to prove that he's even better than the wealthy kid\" ... but no. It turns into deceitful games, plotting, lying, jeopardizing ... in short, really reaffirms the unfortunate stereotypes of the lower class or the poor, especially those who are the housekeepers full time. If anything, this film probably exacerbated the paranoia of the upper class to be on edge when it comes to hiring people or their current staff. Really distasteful. As someone who rose from the lower class through extreme work ethic, I can tell you, I don't appreciate these types of films one bit. The message of this film was beyond disturbing and tone-deaf; essentially sending a message that there is no hope for you, so the father makes matters worse by committing murder which then reaffirms the stereotype of the poor being dangerous and murderous. This film was all sorts of tone-deaf culturally. I feel that those who come from comfortable lives saw this film as some novel plot, maybe even think they were empathizing with the struggles of the poor by liking this film ... but as I mentioned, personally coming from poverty, the message and stereotyping were beyond f***ed up.

At least, that is what the assumption is. But, if one were to look outside the country, there exists a whole slew of original material just waiting to be watched. And look no further than the country of South Korea. That is where today's film \"Parasite\" is the definition of originality. Directed by Bong Joon-ho and co-Written by him, the movie is a cautionary modern allegory of the poor taking on the rich. But what makes \"Parasite\" truly stand out is that the movie is something us Americans need more than ever. It's all thanks to one little country all the way across the Pacific. From it's acting, direction, set and production design, to even the little details that require multiple viewings to get an accurate detail of what is going on. \"Parasite\" is one of those films that thrives on originality, and make the use of its country to a great maximum.\n\nThe story is a little complicated to explain; just keep in mind, that you have to experience the movie for yourself in order to understand it. But I'll try my best not to spoil the movie. The plot of the film involves a poor family living in South Korea trying to make ends meet. A friend of the son comes by and tells him that he works for a very rich family, and that he is going abroad. He asks the son to take over his job, to which the son accepts gratefully. Soon, the son gets his family into working for the rich people. But as this family learns, everything comes with a price...\n\n\"Parasite\", like I said. Is one of those films that you just have to see for yourself in order to fully understand, but here's what I mean when you need to see this movie.\n\nThe setting is perfect for this film; it couldn't happen here in the United States, as it would impose as a difficulty within the context of the story. That and the cinematography are absolutely stunning. From the shifting weather of sunny to rain, the movie really looks good, and it is required to have it played out on the big screen, if possible.\n\nOn a technical level, \"Parasite\" excels in everything. From the lighting to the sound, everything is mixed and edited extremely well, as it is handled in a direction that fits the nature of the film itself. Top that with a minimalist orchestrated score, and you got yourself one amazing film to view.\n\nHowever, there are two things that work in a grandiose manner for \"Parasite\".\n\nFirst, the direction from Bong Joon-ho is absolutely stunning. From the blocking of actors, to the when the intense moments occur, including two very important scenes with the poor family trying to escape the rich family's house, and an intense thunderstorm, his direction is everywhere. It is simply the best. Bong Joon-ho is clearly starting to become one of the best directors of modern cinema, and \"Parasite\" clearly shows that this man has potential.\n\nThe most important aspect for this movie is the story. Cultures clashing, the importance of family, it's all here, and handled extremely well. Contrasting a run time of a little over two hours, the story grips the viewers attention on the edge of their seats, with jaws dropping and eyes wide open, the story is full of twists and turns that you will not see coming.\n\nHowever, while the story is really good, and providing some inciting social commentary, there are some problems with it. For one thing, there are some plot holes and situations that don't make a whole lot of sense, and it seems like the poor family planned this in advance. But other than that, the movie itself is a damn solid piece of entertainment.\n\nOverall, \"Parasite\" is a magnificent film that truly proves there is potential for originality to shine through. We just got to look for it.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "Mar 04, 2020", "text": "My immediate reaction was more subdued than after the Oscars and I reflected on it. It definitely stands out.  Acting is brilliant.  Bong once again masterfully crafts a metaphor for his progressive views.  Keeps you guessing and pays it off in the end.  However, the twist in it is... not only unexpected, but almost ridiculously impossible, and it immediately turned a very intelligent, psychological thriller into something akin to allegory.

WOW what a movie, one of the best films and some of the best directing I have ever seen, so many good things to talk about here so let's get started here.\n\nFirst of all, the performances and the Kim family were very interesting. Everyone's performances here was fantastic and I am surprised the actors are not getting more recognition here. Everyone did a very nuanced and excellent job at showing the cleverness of the characters and how far the characters will go not to get found out. I also found the Kim family very interesting. I loved how they were slowly one by one making their way into the house, and the whole family had completely different personalities which I also appreciated.\n\nNext the film-built tension really well and used gore effectively. This film balanced so many tones well, but I think it balanced the tenseness very well. Due to being confined to the house for a large majority it was very claustrophobic for the characters. And some of the camerawork when the family was hiding was truly fantastic and made you feel tense in general but also for the characters involved. They also used gore very effectively as well. It wasn't overused but it didn't need to be, but it was used enough to leave an impact in the perfect way. They happened more out of nowhere which was excellently executed and very startling.\n\nNext the films cinematography and set pieces were fantastic. Wow this film was an absolute feast for the eyes, whether it was the attention to detail through the camerawork or using normal props like peaches or tents in a completely different way this film was just so detailed and masterfully filmed it was insane to watch. The set pieces were also fantastic, I loved the deliberate sharp contrast between the rich and the poor house and both were explored very well, the poor house of the Kim's was extremely cramped and they gave you a good visual representation of what living in the slums would be like, but the contrast of the rich families house was fantastic, it had so many different components to it and each part of the house was explored well it was a great playground for some fantastic and cleverly put together scenes.\n\nMy next two positives would be the humour and the fantastic final act. Parasite had a fantastic comedic undertone to it that worked really well the dynamic between the Kim family really worked and they had some great comedic moments together that reminded me of my own family in places, similar to the gore it wasn't overused and I am glad it wasn't as otherwise the film wouldn't of worked as well but it was used enough to get a few good laughs out of me. I also have to commend Bong Jun Ho for a truly fantastic final act that was completely unexpected. I didn't know what was going to happen which was fantastic and left me wanting to know what happens next, and where they ended up going with the film took me by complete surprise but in the best way possible, huge respect for Bong for his masterful directing here.\n\nMy final two positives that really made the movie phenomenal was its exceptional script and deep and truthful themes about the class divide in today's society. Wow I think this film had the best script I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. The amount of amazing comments on society and clever ways to develop the characters I was in awe of the films cleverness. The films messages about the class conflict in today's society were so insightful it really made me stop and think which is what a good movie shall do. How the film portrayed the naivety of the upper class and how unaware they are of the struggles of the poor was excellent.  The ending was also showed the harsh brutality of where the poor is places in society and that is sadly underneath the rich which was really impactful for me I gave this film 99 only because it took me a fair amount of time to realise the true message of the film instead of straight away. But there was just so many little messages that were conveyed so well it really made you think.\n\nOverall parasite is one of the best films I have ever seen, with masterful directing, cinematography, screenwriting and performances which leads to an exciting rollercoaster of a film that will leave you shocked and make you think more deeply about the state of the world class system.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 29, 2020", "text": "It\u2019s in my top 3 films of all time", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 29, 2020", "text": "Despite the rave reviews, awards, and accolades -- I'm not a fan.

Bong has the ability to fluidly create transformations within the characters themselves and their environments, having the calm housekeeper become a madwoman and a happy backyard celebration become a bloodbath.  Countering the opinions made by Rick Kisonak from the Vermont newspaper Seven Days, in which he claims that the movie makes no significant statements, I believe that the insight that this film offers does measure up to the grandeur it is receiving. Some in accordance with Kisonak may argue that referencing a social ill isn't the same as saying something insightful about it. However, I believe that the conversations that are being generated in response to the film surrounding social realism and its role in modern-day society are insightful in themselves. Kisonak is quick to assume that the Bong wants us to side with the poor, and as a result, believes that the commentary of the movie is condescending. Though there is ambiguity created from the fact that both families are set up so that you are not rooting for one over I find it extremely tasteful and it further enforces his theme that there are no bad guys here. It leaves room for the audience to ponder on who the real parasites are. Is it the poor who attach themselves to the rich in efforts to leech off their wealth? Is it the rich thrive who off the backs of the poor, and are unable to complete basic tasks without enlisting working-class servants to refine their lives?

Parasite is at its core, a comedic heist movie that evolves into a tragedy; a brilliant piece of satire that gives an insightful look into class struggle. The film delves deep into the modern human hunger for wealth, the relentless search for it, and how tunnel vision can bring out the worst in even the sanest of humans. What begins as the impoverished Kim family's light-hearted and comical attempt at inserting themselves into the wealthy Park family by providing various \"high-end\" services, upon revealing to the audience a dark secret unbeknownst to the Parks, then spirals into sadistic cataclysm unraveling the basest of human intents leading to a gory, terrifying conclusion. A stellar cast does a brilliant job of portraying the various personalities of both families, making the characters feel all the more believable. The core message Parasite conveys is obvious, as it is stated by one of the main characters. However, it is what lies beneath that message that Bong Joon-ho wants the audience to decipher, and this is done remarkably through the themes and symbolism alluding to those answers. Parasite is perhaps arguably one of the most important cinematic works of the decade, shedding light on countless societal issues that plague our time. It forces viewers to see class divide through the eyes of the Kim family in their pursuit of wealth and complete disregard for others, leaving a trail of despair that comes back to haunt them. Viewers should expect to walk away from the theatre with philosophical and psychological questions with difficult answers, and should inspire discussions about the human psyche.

Every character does not need 20-30mins of getting them into the rich family. It wasn't even interesting how they were doing it. All they did for each character when it comes down to it, was to trick the rich mom by simply telling her too. The dumbest part of the movie is how the poor dad killed the rich dad. You could had taken your daughter to the hospital, saved your wife, killed the killer, or go to your son. But, you chose to kill the one man or has treated you well and was just trying to take his son to the hospital? Why, do you have such a thing against people thinking you smell bad/poor? The movie never explains or shows anything? All of a sudden that's your killing motivation? So, stupid. I get it, he wasn't all emotional there, because he just saw his son lifeless body being carried and daughter stabbed. Also, some stuff with social status, but who cause. They don't show/explains anything and it's all left for your own interpretation. My interpretation is wtf? There still so much things I want to say like how the bad the movie's theme went from and a scheming to suspends to a slasher film in like 0 to 100, how unrealistically the family member got into the rich family, how the father is a millionaire or something, but doesn't have security and so on.

With a sequence that resembles the beginning of Scola's Ugly, Dirty and Bad (Brutti, sporchi e cattivi, 1976), Bong Joon Ho transport us into a world that unfolds the social tensions between the poor and the wealthy.  A black comedy takes place, touching the viewer's most secret fears about globalization: the upheaval of the poorest, yet capable immigrants, against their privileged, yet overconfident, masters. As in Kafka's novels, the hyperreality of the fable supersedes the metaphor in order to create its own universe.  The absurdity of the plot is compensated with our will to believe on it.  A father, a mother and their children\u2013son and daughter, stage a series of scams in order to become servants of a wealthy family.  Their reward is awkwardly na\u00efve: the possibility of becoming masters of the house when their masters are not at home.\n\ncXoFTolA\n\nParasite starts in a basement, a clear allusion to Almod\u00f3var's High Heels (Tacones Lejanos, 1991). All the members of the family are unemployed. They appeared to be crooked, but their crookedness doesn't go beyond stealing their neighbor's WIFI signal. All the conventions of reality are broken and we are introduced into a metaphorical universe. The basement is part of a building in no-one's land, or in the poorest slums of most third-world countries, from Haiti to Bangladesh, from Sudan to Vietnam. A family of capable, and yet frustrated professionals, are obliged to accept the first opportunity to \"travel\" to another community thanks to an unexpected recommendation. Their social status becomes a real problem. After all, they are the outcasts of the earth; so, they are obliged to falsify their son's documents. The social status of a professional without a degree is, indeed, not very different from that of an immigrant without a working visa. But before getting his coveted job, the son should present his documentation to customs. The appointment of Sun-Kyun Lee with Yeo-jeong Jo could have taken place in any customs office of the world. Yeo-jeong dismisses the documents as unimportant, for they appear to be authentic. To insist on the protocols of a world divided by stamps may seem rude for such an aristocratic lady. Woo-sik gets his job and, by pushing one of the most sensitive topics of immigration, tries to seduce the youngest girl of the family.\n\nStill, not happy with the benefits of his new job, Woo-sik conspires to move all the members of his family into his new adoptive home. His sister gets soon a vacant job as a tutor. But they also want to bring their parents, so they plot against the chauffeur and the maiden of the house. They both get fired. Almost immediately the unfortunate locals are replaced by Mr. and Ms. Kim. The story appears to end there. How brief happy endings are. We are fate to witness the furious reaction of the locals.\n\nFrom immemorial times, natives have resented the presence of immigrants in their communities. It's believed that they rob their jobs and that they seduce their women. Quite often, enraged and, needless to write, intolerant mobs, decide to correct such \"abuses\", so they attack and kill innocent men, women and children. In Joon-ho's celebrated film all this happens. The second part of the film is a battle between the immigrants and the locals for the privileged of serving the wealthy. But the wealthy are not exempt of guilt.  After all, they have created the social conditions for a struggle that conveys a scant reward. In the final scenes of the film, the revolt of the servants becomes a revolution. A Native-American tent is set up in a children's party as a sinister reminder of the triumph of a group of immigrants over the locals. In Parasite, it's a failed revolution. After all, revolutions today are only allowed in third-world countries. At the end, all immigrants pay for their crimes. They learnt the hard way. They are obliged to accept that ceaseless work and study are the only possible ways to success.\n\nA parable on Immigration, but also a warning on the social conditions of globalization, where a global revolt appears to be just around the corner.\n\nBucaramanga, September 16, 2019", "score": 4}, {"date": "Feb 23, 2020", "text": "it wasn't a typical Hollywood movie", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 23, 2020", "text": "Excellent movie, excellent story and cast!!!", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 23, 2020", "text": "It would've been five stars if it were in English.

And yet, Parasite didn't just meet my expectations, it surpassed them. \n\nAnyone who knows me will tell you that I never read reviews before watching a movie; I'll only read them after. I always preach about the benefits of knowing little about a movie before seeing it. I think Parasite is a case in point: a movie enjoyed most thoroughly when the viewer has little pre-existing knowledge about it. \n\nWhat makes Bong Joon-ho's latest feature so exciting is its unpredictability. It has a surprising narrative structure. Think of Parasite, if you will, as a train journey, with Bong the chief architect and the driver. The train doesn't arrive at the expected end destination, and the journey to the final stop is wildly unpredictable. The tonal landscape of the movie shifts as Parasite moves throughout its course. Social realism gives way to surreal horror, by way of jet-black humour and sometimes farce. For our train journey metaphor, think of these tonal changes as the volatile weather outside the window. And despite the unpredictable nature of the journey, the driver always maintains complete control of all. \n\nOkay, excuse the rough metaphor, but it seems apposite to include one in a review of a film whose director's metier is metaphors. In fact, in what seems like a self-mocking act from Bong, characters in the film often comment several times on how metaphorical things are. The movie is, too, full of symbolism: the rain and different levels being two noteworthy ones. The film is so packed with symbols and metaphors, it makes watching it so fascinating. \n\nThe sociopolitical import of Parasite is clear, highlighting the disparity between South Korea's classes, and taking aim at late capitalism. The politics works because its central message is delivered through humour and horror (in equal measure), instead of prosaically, as with many other films. Metaphors are the tool Bong uses oftentimes to highlight the differential lives of the rich and the poor families. For instance, the rain that comes down towards the end of the movie flooding the entire house of the Kim family fails to penetrate the Park child's tent. At times in the latter half of the movie, Bong perhaps suffers from a lack of subtlety, laying the message on too thick - for example, with the rich family holding their noses when the Kim father is nearby. But Parasite's lack of subtlety is a justifiable and possibly inevitable consequence of a movie that is this bold. \n\nHony Kyung-pyo's cinematography expertly captures the starkly different milieus of the two families. The Kim's semi-basement is claustrophobic and restrictive and the Park's mansion is vast and airy. I also think the shooting of the impressive flood scenes at the end of the movie deserves to be hugely commended. It is a film of impressive and important technical ability - something that I didn't expect.\n\nThere's one moment on which the movie pivots: a moment that takes the film into a place you don't foresee it going.  As the camera rushes through the black space into the basement, music reaching a crescendo, everything becomes impossibly tense. And then, moments later, the viewer begins to realise gradually what's happening. It is one of the most exciting and astounding things I've ever witnessed in the cinema.\n\nParasite is absolutely one of the year's best. It's an incredible, shockingly bold piece of film-making that is both a mainstream crowd-pleaser and an art-house wonder.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 22, 2020", "text": "Omg and they gave this an Oscar...", "score": 0.5}, {"date": "Feb 22, 2020", "text": "Filled with twists and turns, as well as a frank look into the social issues of today's society, Parasite is a riveting movie that should not be missed.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "Feb 22, 2020", "text": "Unpredictable plot.

I was going to wait to watch the film, but after realizing how many Academy Awards it was up for, I decided to give it a watch the Saturday night before the Oscars: it was the best cinematic decision I made all year. The Kim family is a sinister bunch who you root for even when you shouldn't. I could list off each character/actor, but I'll save time and just say there wasn't a weak performance among them: each played a role, each nailed the role. Symbolism abounds, as the Kims survive (I choose this word deliberately) in a subterranean lair where they have to contend with neighborhood fumigation, micturating drunkards, and typhoon floodwaters, which eventually turn their lives into a literal world of shit. The Park family, on the other hand, lives in a modern oasis that feels like it was dropped into Seoul from outer space \u2014 with plenty of lawn and garage space, I should add. The symbolism is most apparent when the help \u2014 old and new \u2014 are battling to the death in the mansion's soundproof basement while the Park family lives in ignorant bliss upstairs. The only part of the movie I wanted more clarification on was how Kim Ki-Jeong (Park So-dam) was able to control Park Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) from being a tornado of energy. They never really show any techniques or power (abuse) she uses to keep the child in line.

Part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. What is certain is that it's exceptional in just about every way \u2013 screenplay (co-written by director Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, mise en sc\u00e8ne, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things \u2013 it lives up to the hype.\n\nThe Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment eking out a meagre living folding pizza boxes. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo bluffs his way into working as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park family. Father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun) welcome Ki-woo into their home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places. However, it doesn't take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families.\n\nAs thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as Parasite is, it remains an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. This is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, but never before has he been this caustic and acerbic, but so too compassionate and witty. One of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is his avoidance of the clich\u00e9s one so often finds in films dealing with economics \u2013 the Kims are by no means a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels.\n\nBong is uninterested in trucking in heroes and villains because such rigid diametrics aren't the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, whilst the Parks' greatest crime is allowing their wealth to insulate them from the world of families such as the Kims. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims often occupy the same frame, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot. Important here is the title. A simple reading is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks' wealth and status. However, Bong depicts the Parks as parasitic as well, feeding off of the labour of their servants. Just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what is a symbiotic relationship.\n\nAesthetically, Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography is magnificent. Hong also shot the superb Beoning (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks' house like it's a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun's production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims' cluttered and dilapidated apartment contrasted with the Parks' pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house.\n\nIt's also in relation to production design wherein one of the film's best metaphors is to be found. As a story at least partly in the tradition of the \"upstairs/downstairs\" subgenre, Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below by using stairways as a recurring motif. The Kims' apartment has no stairs, indicating their inability to rise socio-economically. On the other hand, the Parks' home has two stairways \u2013 one going up to the bedrooms where the four children spend an increasing amount of time, cut off from their parents, and one going down into the cellar. Bong shoots this stairway like he's suddenly directing a horror film, bestowing upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing.\n\nParasite is a masterpiece, with Bong never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie \u2013 a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich \u2013 but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant. Quite unlike anything I've ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy and so on.

Especially since such shelters are common in South Korea.\n3. The son could speak fluent English; why can't he get a real job?\n4. If the daughter is clever enough to pose as a skilled art teacher who graduated from the University of Chicago, why can't she figure out how to fold that damn pizza box? \n5. What homeowner doesn't run a basic background check on their prospective household help?\n6. The rich couple makes love on the couch while the poor family - the entire clan - hides under the nearby coffee table.  Yeah, right.\n7.

However, the rich were benefitting from their service, more of a symbiotic relationship. The rich took the work of the poor to the point it felt it was entitled. Come when we want. We pay you extra. Respect. Cross the line. Who crossed the line? At first it seems like the poor family has crossed the line but at the birthday party it has really revealed it.... Despite the [spoiler]the fact that \"Jessica\" was stabbed and Kims wife was desperately fighting against the maniac, Mr. Park only cares for his unconscious son who would \"probably\" die in the next 15 min. Sure, bringing his unharmed son to hospital is more important than to rescue an blood stained girl who is at the edge of death [/spoiler]. That's also [spoiler] the reason why Kim has stabbed him: Then when his daughter got stabbed, none of them cared. Like fuck you, lets see what youll do if you got stabbed instead[/spoiler]. At this point it is hard to decide which family to like and to dislike.\nSpeaking of a different topic: The movie protrayed the discrepance between poor and rich very well e.g. the rain scene. The rich love the rain  because it cleaned the filth and brightened the day. While it destroyed the lives of the poor. Parasites don't often know they harm the host.\nI think the movie did portray the rich as gullible, simple and naive. As the wife said:\" They are not rich and nice.

As with his previous films, Snowpiercer and Okja, social critiques disguised as sci-fi thrillers, Parasite is a giddy blend of conflicting themes and tonal shifts. It begins as a tongue-in-cheek comedy about the class system in South Korea \u2013 or really, anywhere in the world, giving it an instant sense of timely significance \u2013 and then, like a magic trick, effortless slips into a claustrophobic home-invasion thriller. The cheeky grin that welcomes you into the film becomes something altogether more uncomfortable and difficult to pin down. In the same way that the Park family are duped by the Kims, the audience are tricked into settling in for one film and slapped with an entirely different one half-way through, with all the doors locked and the only way out is to scramble over the bodies. It is a film that only Bong Joon Ho could make.\n\nOn the surface, Parasite is a simple film to describe \u2013 it's about a lower-class family latching onto a wealthy family and draining their resources, in the same way a parasite infiltrates and infects its host. Dig a little deeper and it's clear that this is not a film about good and bad morality, it's grey and murky, and if you poke it, as Bong Joon-Ho does with a dash of Hitchcock-inspired mayhem, blood spills.\n\nSong Kang Ho, in utterly captivating form, is Ki-taek \u2014 head of the Kim family. They live in a damp and messy basement house that's literally half-way below ground, often providing perfect view from their living room of the local drunk who urinates from above. They scurry around for high ground so they can leach off neighbouring Wi-Fi spots, and the film begins in a moment of brief panic when they can no longer find any. Fortunately, if they clamber to the top of their toilet seat, perhaps where the internet belongs, WhatsApp beams back into their existence. These aren't dim people and Bong makes it clear from the start that despite their economic status, these are ambitious, talented, crafty individuals. They are so resourceful that Ki-taek has them leave the window open as pest control spray the street, the gas flooding through into their home, engulfing the family and killing their pest problem in the process.\n\nOpportunity strikes, and sometimes that's all you need, when Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) gets a job offer from his university student friend who makes money tutoring rich kids. He's going away and needs somebody to take over. Ki-woo agrees and the Kim family put their audacious plan into place. Fancy paperwork later, artistically designed by his talented sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam), Ki-woo is marching up to the Park family estate that sits high up in the hills, fitted with electronic doors and fortress-like walls. Not long before he convinces simple but well-meaning house wife Yeon-Kyo ( Cho Yeo Jeong) that he's an esteemed tutor, she makes the point that her artistic son is struggling with trauma, and so he recommends Ki-jung for an art-therapist role, pretending they don't know each other. One by one, the Kim family wriggle their way into the Park home, sending the previous employees to the streets, and so the roles and fortunes are beginning to change. But this a Bong-Joon Ho film, and with delighted content comes a crushing reality, and this is slammed home with the film's poignant final shot. None of this can last.\n\nThe way it out all plays out is wickedly fun, as the Kim family deceive the Parks in a variety of ingenious ways. To the script's credit, which had it win a Bafta for original screenplay, none of the scenarios seem implausible. And while it's as enjoyable as a caper-comedy, there is a grimness to the way the Park family, blinded by their wealth and self-importance, have been so easily swindled and invaded. Move an inch past the comedy, as Bong-Joon Ho does with razor-sharp ease, and Parasite becomes a deeply uncomfortable film about privacy and social hierarchy. Does that make the Kim family the villains here? It's not clear and obvious. After all, they just want a better life for themselves, and nobody's getting hurt yet. On the other hand, you have the Park family who are rich and openly recoil at those beneath them, even insisting that the Kim family all have a certain smell that defines them \u2013 a call back to the stench of the stink bugs eradicated earlier in the film. And yet, the Parks are not bad people, they love their son and daughter \u2013 like Ki-taek, Dong-ik (Lee Sun Kyun) simply wants the best for his family, and he gives them that with the money he earns. As the film reaches its wild finale, the grin that started the film shifting into a grimace, the answer to which family is the parasite becomes even harder to reach.\n\nAs with the best of Bong, there is magic to the way everything comes together. Parasite is much more than an entertaining genre mash-up with a brilliant script. It's a crisp and clean clockwork machine, made up of ideas all working together and executed seamlessly to create an indefinable but very special whole. The title is metaphorical, something that Ki-woo reiterates throughout, but Parasite could equally apply to the way the spaces of the Park home get inside of you before you even realise the camerawork is doing anything special. The house is a stunning creation with all the intricacies and character of a stage play, of which Parasite was once planned to be, but Bong scrapped that when he began writing the script and could only see the possibilities of an expertly placed camera. He was right and cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, fresh from Burning, and in another career highlight, defines every single space in the Park home with the same love and attention that's gone into the script. None of this is explicitly done. It all happens through the introduction of the different characters and their interaction with each layer of the house. Everything has been thought out and how the families occupy the space, from the cosy but cramped Kim home to the wide-open Park house, which has its basement entrance cast in permanent darkness against the bright glow of the kitchen lights, as if anything below this level of the house is a home for something evil. Yeon-Kyo suggests as such by telling Ki-jung that her son's trauma came from there. Again, everything in the film, from its script to its set design, feeds back to its themes of class warfare.\n\nNobody can stop talking about Parasite, and nobody should. It's the rare film that is both an absolute riot and a complicated dissection of current real-world issues. It's funny, sad, uncomfortable and violent. It's a Bong Joon Ho film, it's his best yet, and nobody is doing cinema quite like this.\n\nhttps://reelrunner.wordpress.com/2020/02/04/parasite-review-bong-joon-hos-impeccably-designed-social-satire-is-a-riot/", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 13, 2020", "text": "This genre is finally getting its due!

I just finished watching it and I don't know if I can properly articulate how good it is or why because I'm running on such a high right now. It's all good. Everything. The writing, the acting, the directing, the framing, the editing, the plot, the dialogue; there literally isn't a single fault. It's perfectly executed and I love it\n\nEverything it says about society and culture: the way we idolize the wealthy, how apathetic they are to our struggles, how a proximity to wealth can make us turn on our own in pursuit of status, how capitalism works to dehumanize us, how our own advancement comes at the expense of others, how the rich live and the poor merely survive, how the wealthy force us into competition with each other, how expendable we are to the bourgeois class in a capitalist society, how distant our two worlds can seem from each other even if they're only a few subway stops away. I can write an extensive essay on any one of those points. It's smart, it's funny, it's dark, it's deep, it's philosophical, it's tragic; it's all the things.\n\nI was engaged from the first scene to the last. The family was so easy to root for because anyone who's ever lived through hardship can relate to what they're going through. Every poor person has dreamed about being a rich person. To live how the other half lives, even if just for a moment. They get a nice gig, but it ends up being too good to be true. My heart was racing for basically the last hour of the film because something happens that I can't say and the story goes from a light-hearted romp about a family cleverly scheming their way into a better situation to something completely different in an instant.\n\nI honestly can't say too much more without giving anything away, but god do I want to make everyone I know watch it so I can talk about all the great themes. The beautiful, beautiful themes! I can't recommend it highly enough. If subtitles normally deter you, give it a chance anyway. Like Bong Joon Ho, the writer/director of the movie and winner of many Oscars, said, \"Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films\". This has actually inspired me to watch more foreign language media going forward, which I've always hesitated to do. Because if my prejudice has kept me from seeing gems like this all these years, then I want to correct that as soon as possible. \n\nYou can rent it on Amazon Prime for $4, so I suggest you do that and see it immediately.

Biting social subtext, brilliantly layered editing, masterful and witty dialogue, a perfectly utilized score, and impeccable directing created one of my favorite films ever. One should go into this film with at least a basic understanding of the current socioeconomic climate of South Korea. The fundamental issue at hand is the immense discrepancy between the resources and fiscal opportunities available to the lower class and the lavish lives of the wealthy. Throughout the film, the Kims (lower class) and the Parks (upper class) are masterfully juxtaposed through both overt and subtle means in order to best emphasize the class strife present in South Korea. One such instance was the monsoon sized rain storm towards the end of the film. The Parks see the rainstorm as beautiful and their son even camps outside in a clearly expensive tent. The Kims, however, return to the sub-levels of their residence to find their beloved basement home irreparably damaged and flooded. In the wake of this disaster, the Parks opt to celebrate and throw a party for their beloved son and ask that the Kims, who are sleeping in a public rec center, (unbeknownst to the Parks) to attend. This stark contrast underscores the animosity and resentment felt by the lower classes as their struggles are completely ignored and tossed aside by the wealthy, a situation not at all dissimilar from the current socioeconomic conditions in the United States. Bong Joon Ho deserved every bit of lauding and praise that he received for this masterpiece. His extensive story-boarding paved the way for a masterclass in editing by Yang Jin-Mo, whose 'frankensteinish' work with some scenes gave the best representation of the actor's gripping performances. Bong Joon Ho's masterful directing is on full display throughout the whole film but is best represented by one sequence. All I ask is that you watch the roughly five-minute long 'peach' sequence and tell me this movie isn't at the apex of cinema today. The editing, directing, score, and acting were... impeccable. The passage of time felt like a breeze despite the immense weight and importance of the sequence to the overall narrative. Callbacks to earlier moments in the SEQUENCE (not even the film itself) were incredible and rewarding. If you didn't notice, play close attention to the hot sauce packets used during the sequence and you'll see what I mean. The entire cast was superb and their win for best ensemble at the BAFTA's is unfortunately the most award recognition they will receive for their effort. Seriously, if you haven't seen this film, do yourself a huge favor and watch it by any means possible.

On a level all their own, a masterful level. That their vision is one of a kind. *Parasite* was that powerful to me and I had that strong of a reaction to it. Because it's so well layered, gut punch powerful and masterfully crafted that it cannot be denied; and it's impossible to look away, even when the tides turn in unexpected directions you may not have seen coming.

It's even rarer for a foreign film to earn Academy Awards nominations for Best Foreign Language (now called International) film and Best Picture, but Parasite has managed to join this exclusive club. Director Bong Joon-ho has long been turning out top quality, intriguing work (I'm a big fan of his melancholy 2003 film Memories of Murder, about a years long hunt for a serial killer). Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won's Oscar nominated original screenplay switches tones and even genres so abruptly and successfully, it makes Parasite a unique movie to say the least. Combined with a stellar cast, excellent cinematography, production design, and pacing, Parasite becomes a thoroughly engrossing, extraordinary experience. Movies like this in any language are rare indeed.\n\nParasite begins as a dark comedy and sharp satire about economic inequality and class disparity. The Kim family lives in a shabby basement apartment. The street level window provides them a view of ankles and urinating drunks. They work short term odd jobs and hunt around their apartment for a spot with Wi-Fi. A change in luck comes when a friend of their teenage son recommends him as a tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. The son, Ki-woo, reluctantly accepts though he is under qualified. Soon the Kim family schemes to replace each of the Park family servants with themselves though they pose under false identities. The 20-ish Kim daughter, Ki-jeong, provides the family with false credentials. Things take a fateful and irreversible turn when the Kims decide to have a night in luxury while the Parks are away for the weekend.\n\nThat plot description seems to make the title describe the Kim family. As you watch them work their way into the home of the Park family, you may find the title applies more to the Parks whose lifestyle requires people like the Kims. The differences between a family that is oblivious of their wealth and a family that schemes to get stable, working-class jobs is apparent. But then, the film reveals layers and depth that make it truly profound. When the film becomes a riveting thriller, it does not eschew its themes and substance. I cannot recall the last time I had no idea where a film was going, not because of incompetence, but because I was watching the work of a master filmmaker.\n\nThe entire ensemble is terrific. Each role is well cast and there's a great chemistry between the members of the respective families. The stand outs for me, however are Song Kang-ho as the Kim family patriarch and Park So-dam as his clever daughter. Cho Yeo-jeong as the daffy and gullible Park matriarch is great comic relief.\n\nWhat sets Parasite a step above other socially conscious films is it does not sacrifice entertainment for the sake its social commentary or vice versa. It never pontificates or pretends to have any didactic solution. It is like a classic Twilight Zone episode, up front about its themes but in such a way that doesn't speak down to audience and feels detached and immediate simultaneously. There is not a single pandering moment in the entire film. Parasite uses the real problems and concerns of modern society to tell a compelling and universal story that causes us to reflect on our world. That can be the definition a great film and great art.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 09, 2020", "text": "As excellent as everyone says.

Weeks after watching Parasite in full color, I watched it again in black & white. I prefer the color version and the movie left a lot for the audience to reflect on afterwards. Relatable in the sense that the rich get richer and the poor are left to fend for themselves, it can also reflect on country relationships between S. Korea and other Asian nations alongside the US. South Korea has come a long way in terms of its economic advances but you take the magnifying glass and will realize that many young people there are still not able to get jobs and richer people have access to resources and tutoring programs that make a huge difference in advancement such as tough college entrance exams. Both SK and US have questionable leaders of both countries where it is uncertain if they lead on the interest of its citizens or the interests of their own party/financial interests. In an age where anyone can google, gullible characters fall for a multi-phased manipulative plans initially seeming innocent enough. There's references to \"crossing the line\" meaning class clashes between character families. The class difference is noted via \"smell\" which is akin to sub basement dwellings or the subways. There are some reflective moments of happiness in the movie where characters look at the sky from home, relax at a modern home which is not theirs \"this is our home right now\" or share laughter over family meals in tiny kitchens or taxi driver restaurants. It's almost like the director is teaching us to enjoy the moment and the little things because it is all so fleeting. The struggling daughter pleads with her father to \"just worry about us\" which could be in reference to international relations or an omen for upcoming provocation. Planning is a key theme throughout the movie where initial plans fall into multiple phases. The struggling father eventually notes that no plan makes for no disappointment or a plan that never fails- which seems to me like just giving up. Hasn't he heard the saying that a poor plan is better than no plan? Water represents a lot in the movie from pouring rain to flooding. Flooding occurs where the struggling daughter climbs up to the highest point in her family apartment which happens to be a toilet spewing sewage. She climbs on top of the toilet seat and holds it down as she smokes a cigarette and sewage seeps through the lid under her legs. There's this landscape rock the struggling family receives as a gift and it represents the possibility of wealth. It's used as a weapon and then finally laid back on a river bed where water washes over the rock. Perhaps this means that to this struggling family, wealth may seem attainable but there  are layers of water between them and the rock. The struggling son also notes that the rock tends to follow him. The high point of the struggling family is when all four are hired to work. It makes you wonder how much the rich family pays for them collectively. But also what does it means at a country level because who really is getting the short end of the stick? Who's the fool? Or are we all fools? Who's the bad guy or are we all bad? Only the youngest child in the movie seems to have any semblance of normalcy where he plays freely (but gets criticized for it) and where he feels and reacts (but then gets labeled as traumatized for it).

He keeps the Parks, the Kims, and the audience separate from each other. You see the struggles the Kims go through everyday, but you don't really feel sorry for them. Then you have the Parks. They're the victims and they don't deserve what happens to them, but they deserve so much more. For the audience, Ho takes you on a roller coaster. He shows you the peaks you can have when you're on top. Then within seconds show the valleys of poverty. Which creates the struggle inside you. Ho keeps letting you get close to connecting to any character then pulls you back to neutral. That makes for a fantastic watch. You're on the edge of your seat from the start.

By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.\n\nBong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.\n\nThen the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.\n\nFrom a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!\n\nThe cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles.

However, I believe I've seen a film that just might be worthy of the term. So, here's my spoiler free Parasite movie review explaining why it just might be a masterpiece.\n\nParasite is a film that manages to be funny, creative, unpredictable, heart wrenching, and is extremely thought-provoking. Additionally, it's able to balance multiple tones successfully at the same time with great performances. \n\nI love how this film pulls common elements used in comedies, dramas, and moments of suspense. Then, mixes them effectively to specific moments to make us feel different emotions throughout the film. It's as if the story is more concerned with being as real, and transparent as humanly possible. It can connect to us on multiple levels instead of focusing on just one emotion or genre. I also love this aspect because as humans we don't operate on one emotion at a time. Sometimes it can be mixed, and sometimes it can vary from moment to moment. So, Parasite balances this perfectly.\n\nAfter the film was over, I was left sitting there while the credits rolled to let the film completely overtake me. I reflected on all of the themes, story, plot, characters, and etc that really impacted me. Parasite is truly a rare experience that stayed with me for several weeks afterwards even after the credits rolled.\n\nGoing into this film I didn't know much about the Director, Bong Joon-ho. However, I want to see more of his filmography as his directing in Parasite is just immaculate.\n\n*Since this review I've seen Snowpiercer, and Okja. Both films are incredible, and Bong Joon-ho is climbing up the chart as one of my personal favorite Directors.\n\nThematically, I found this film to be one of the most relatable films of 2019. It explores universal themes of poverty, wealth, and family which may seem simple on paper, but the plot of the story is what makes it interesting. Side note, it's also best that I don't say much about the plot because I think it's best to go into this film not knowing much. So, as a result, it made the film unpredictable which is extremely difficult to accomplish. With that being said, the story, and the plot is able to apply the themes creatively without feeling like it's beating you over the head to get the message across.\n\nParasite has performances that are amazing. Each actor and actress are able to organically go through different emotions as if these characters are real people. The family felt like a real family, and I felt like I knew each member of the family individually due to each being well developed. This is also because we get to spend a good amount of time with each family member.\n\nThe music is incorporated perfectly for scenes that were intended to be funny, serious, and suspenseful without being pretentious. The music also doesn't overshadowing the performance.\n\nWhat do I mean by a perfectly unscripted script? Well, to me. Parasite was so well crafted that I truly didn't know what would happen next. That's a rare feeling that I crave in a film and Parasite is so refreshing in that regard. This also speaks to the originality of the script as well. The first act sets us up for a great payoff. The script has great symbolism and metaphors without overly complicating it with dialogue. The plot services the characters development throughout the story. Then, what I love the most is that it truly feels like a story going from one event to the next without a plan. That is the pinnacle of amazing writing, and the following quote from the film explains the narrative perfectly.\n\n\"You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan at all.\"\n\nI highly enjoyed this film so much I could literally write much more, and I still wouldn't be able to explain how great this film is.

Some unique Korean cultural differences could get lost to many Western audiences. Reflecting on them is the main goal of this writing. Remember, these are one person's opinions, take them or leave them. Spoiler alerts. If you haven't seen the movie, then go watch it and then read this afterward.\n\nThe biggest shock to most Westerners when they see the two poor families at each others' throats is, why not work together in order to fulfill each of their purposes to get wealthy and be comfortable? There is enough wealth for everybody.\n\nIt's an excellent question. One of the cultural distinctions of Korea is that there are many ways that people find their identity. It can be in a family, a circle, a class, etc. But if there is neither a history of Jeong  (Shared heart), or Hahn (Shared suffering), then it's hard for strangers to connect empathetically.\n\nYet one might ask: both families are poor; surely the Kim family should be able to feel \"Hahn\" for the other family. Maybe so, but consider that the Kims are in a semi-basement (some have described as Purgatory), whereas the old man is living in the basement bunker (Hell), they are in very different places where the Kims are still able to look down on them both socially and geographically.\n\nAnother observation is the city of Seoul comes across as being very \"post-Christian\"~ very much a secular city. Nietzsche wrote that when God is dead; man is dead; the universe is unchained; one is left staring into a dark abyss. The only thing left to exercise is the will to power. We see this in the movie.\n\nThere is no morality. One can freely print up a fake university diploma off of the Internet and Photoshop it to one's own liking. One is free to be the impostor and just \"fake it until you make it\".\n\nSome others have made the observation that the rain water (and the sewage) flows downward; that Global Warming has caused the poor down below to become flooded out of their homes\u2026 and the rich way up above are oblivious to it\u2026 Just like back during the French Revolution, you can hear Marie Antoinette saying the proverbial \u2026\"Let them eat cake!\"\nNoticing some of the cultural differences can be a challenge. \"Parasite\" is a wonderful dark comedy that is very unique. It's surprisingly anxiety-provoking and enjoyable. It is also thought-provoking.

Or the inconsiderate rich putting up with the poor whom they hire at low wages to do one form or another of their dirty work? Or yet again, are the family of four who work for the rich family, and the former housekeeper and her hubby who is hiding in the basement illustrating yet another kind of parasite: the poor sucking blood off of the poor? When the rich family went camping, and the four related servants took over the living room and lived if for a short time like the rich, in their house on the hill, the crystal palace with a whole wall of glass looking out onto the green of a well-kept yard, you just knew they would screw this up by drinking, eating, excess and messing up the place. Shouldn't they have been more careful not to jeopardize their dishonestly won jobs in the mansion? Alas, therein lies their fatal flaws. People don't always take care to think of everything, maybe those poorer less than others, due to bigger worries, like how to eat, or attitudes born of the big stresses of living on the edge. Beneath the surface, things are boiling so badly, that when the man in the cellar,  whose wife is abused by the servant family, emerges into the daylight, it is with a knife with murder on his mind, and he does kill the young woman in the servant family. But more surprisingly, her Dad then stabs and kills the rich guy who employs him as a driver. The guy in the cellar of the mansion? A perfect symbol of a stratified society with the rich in the upstairs quarters, a poor man in the downstairs. And when the two-dead birthday party incident plays out in the lush back yard with dozens of guests, the mom and son in the servant family end up on probation for offenses of tricking the rich family into hiring all four in the family, the daughter is dead, and the Dad, now a fugitive from justice for having killed his rich boss, has assumed the position as the cellar dweller in the rich people's house. Upstairs, downstairs again, ship of fools.  At the end, the aspiration of his son is to get rich, buy the house, and let Dad come into the upstairs quarters with him and mom, smash that rich/poor line. It is done as a dream, as in, dream on, that won't ever happen. The class split and the economic roles are too baked in the cake -- in Korea or Pittsburgh. A key line comes from the servant mom who is the housekeeper. Hubby calls the rich woman nice. And she says: \"She's nice because she's rich.\" The rich guy tells his wife that the driver doesn't smell good but that when he talks, he \"does not cross the line.\" The line between rich and poor, boss and help.

This movie is seriously overhyped. I think many film critics and fans who knew nothing about the culture in South Korea just enjoyed the suspense thriller without putting any thought or analysis to why they liked it. No one's expecting a documentary when you're watching a suspense thriller but so many aspects of the plot were beyond contrived. I am going to post some spoilers in the next paragraph to point this out so please avoid the rest of this review if you don't want to know what happens. It is absolutely shocking this awful film is up for best picture of the year ### So we meet the Kim family, destitute & living in a cramped basement apartment. The mother father and their two adult children, none of them have a full-time job despite being educated, at least the children are. This is completely unrealistic in a modern city like Seoul. instead the family works together to fold pizza boxes to make their living? Ridiculous. The Park family has all this opulence and wealth, yet they seem completely incapable of getting any referrals or references for the various positions they need filled in their home? there's no way they would allow a family of grifters to come in and literally manipulate the family and get all the positions. to this end, this contrived plot line that Mrs Park is worried about her son and sees his art as a cry for help based on the fact that supposedly he saw a ghost when he was six in the house was nonsense. This film was popular among those who like to see class warfare. The poor Kim family appears to be not responsible for their crimes and it shows them as scrappy survivors who can outsmart and out manipulate the Park family when it suits them. One of the most ridiculous aspects of this, is that they're not successful or smart enough to fit into modern Korean society yet they have the sophistication and the planning to go into this elaborate lie and manipulation with the Park family? Near the end of the film, there is a huge rainstorm. Supposedly it is so bad, that the poor areas in Seoul are completely flooded out, including raw sewage being sprayed all over the Kim's apartment. This isn't 1960s South Korea and this is literally impossible in modern-day Seoul. It's sad and pathetic that this filmmaker, who's from the city, decides to put this metaphor into the plot as if the poor and downtrodden in the city are crapped upon by the elite. So in the middle of the night there's this horrible rain storm and the Kim family sneaks out in the middle of the night to go back to their own home. They did this without transportation walking or running in the streets assuming it's not such a short distance from the opulent neighborhood the Parks live in. after showing scenes of them in the home and trying to rescue some other things suddenly they're in some sort of city evacuation center with others spending the rest of the night? I don't think there's enough time in a day let alone the middle of the night to move around like this! The Park family wakes up and spontaneously decides to have a birthday party during the day for their son? No planning whatsoever and yet they get on the phone and tons of people show up along with catered food and musical accompaniment? Of course that morning they're also able to get the entire Kim family to come back to help out with the party? Could it get any more ridiculous? The filmmaker continues his thinly veiled hatred towards people of success by having the Park family have a native american-themed children's party for their son. with Mr Kim and the father supposedly dressed in his Indians with tomahawks to attack Kim's daughter as she brings out the cake in front of everyone...\ud83d\ude44 Suddenly, there's a lot of chaos and violence, which I'll leave mostly unexplored in this review, yet Mr Kim is insulted when Mr Park takes offense to the way another poor person smells and he decides to kill Mr Park! There's a whole other aspect to the film with a secret bunker under the home that the Park family is completely unaware of. considering there would be a real estate transaction for this home, there's no way they would be unaware of this major apparatus complete with running water and electricity below their own home that's accessible through a cabinet in their finished basement. This whole film is just an allegory by the director on how much hatred and contempt he has for people of success and wealth. He's crafted a film that has very little meaning, little purpose, inconsistent tone, and very basic acting that's not nearly as nuanced or interesting as others make it sound to be. For this film to be nominated for a best picture award and to win lots of other awards at other film competitions is a testament to how politics seeps into reviewers' minds. This director Bong Joon-ho has truly very little talent, yet the critics loved his film of a few years ago called Okja too. I really challenge anyone to watch that film as well as this one and conclude this filmmaker has anything worthy of sharing with an audience. Right now, Korean music, food, and culture are trendy, and I get it as there are many wonderful aspects to this country's rich and interesting traditions. yet a film like parasite is so polarizing and so preachy with its class warfare messages that the filmmaking seems completely secondary.", "score": 1.5}, {"date": "Feb 04, 2020", "text": "This movies is literally one of the best movies I've watched in my whole entire life.

Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki-woo (Choi Woo-Shik) scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected (or underprotected) wi-fi to steal as the unemployed family can't afford phone service and they need it to find work. Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood. When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes, they can't seem to get it right for some reason. Their luck changes when Ki-woo's friend Min (Seo-joon Park) passes his tutoring job on to him. I little fib and a lot of confidence, and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family. But then he sees an in for his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park). I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked, so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck. Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity. Before long the family is doing things so atrocious, I started borderline hating the film. Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile. To be sure, I loved the parasite allegory. One gets in, starts multiplying, eventually severely damaging or destroying the host. That last part I was dreading the most. Yes, I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered. But I felt really bad for the mother (Yeo-jeong Cho) who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home. She was just trying to do what any mother would - what's best for her kids. Her only fault - she wasn't too bright. Of course, I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all. But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators, the \"host\" family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant, at worst - funny. And they are the ones who did nothing wrong. Except for being rich - I suppose that automatically makes them villains. It was really bothering me. But that wasn't the only problem I had with the film. It didn't make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme, when they couldn't even assemble pizza boxes right. And if they are this smart, how is it possible that even the two young ones can't get work? Is Korean economy that bad? Another problem was that interesting things were introduced, but dropped without explanation. Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged. Or what Ki-woo was planning to do with the lucky stone. And that wonderful allegory that existed so naturally in the first half of the movie?

When it comes to dark comedic thrillers, Korean cinema in one year releases more originality than Hollywood could hope to churn out in a lustrum. And from that enchanting land, Bong Joon-ho, one of the country's most celebrated directors, has a series of incredible films under his belt, several of which I have had the pleasure of viewing.\n\nFirst, The Host (2006) was a different take on B-grade 1950s style monster movies, where sludge which is radioactive, toxic and vile, creates a creature feature wreaking havoc on Tokyo\u2026er, Seoul. This is the biggest money-making movie in S. Korean history, and did very well for a short run here in the States. Just a few months after seeing The Host, a pal recommended to me Snowpiercer (2013), which has a ridiculous premise: all of humanity is on a train which travels around the planet, taking 1 year for each circumnavigation. My response: WTF? But my pal was right on, and Snowpiercer is brilliant; full of deep social commentary and a (rather) believable train system isolated and self-perpetuating for humanity's long haul through a frozen world. Oh, and it stars Captain America.\n\nNow Bong Joon-ho's Parasite has crawled into theaters, and instead of creating sci-fi or mild horror, he has fully immersed himself in the dark comedy and dramatic thriller themes with several horrifying moments. Without giving anything away, a stroke of luck for a young man who should have been in college turns out to be, one-by-one, a stroke of luck for his sister, father and then mother. The whole family slyly takes over the important roles \u2014 tutors, driver and cook \u2014 of a credulous family of very wealthy snobs with their single-family enclave home built by a famous architect. Yet the home has secrets, and we see that the wealthy family's beaming innocence means they pass over crazy enigmas by, for instance, not even investigating what they call faulty wiring. Since it doesn't directly effect the shallow parents, these non-normal problems in the home hide sinister slumberings beneath the modern veneer.\n\nAt just the point where I began to ask myself where this film is going, a doorbell rings, and within moments all craziness breaks out, with around 30 minutes of close calls and comedic visualizations bested only by Roman Polanski's Fearless Vampire Killers (1967). Briefly, calm returns to the cast before the corkscrew ending, a bizarre sequence of uptight calumnies, 2 murders, a newsworthy missing person story, and an adventure in the value of being a Cub Scout.\n\nBlending comedy and wound-up suspense is difficult for filmmakers to master, but Joon-ho is obviously a meticulous crafter, and the blending is balanced and feels natural. His well designed photographic sequences make for a blend of vibrancy and subtlety, each where needed.

Bong's stylish direction gives Parasite a brisk pace and makes a 132 minute long film feel like 20 minutes. Parasite features hilarious joke after joke played with a deadpan lethargy like the horrible people acting out awful deeds just bare a nonchalant attitude about it all. I cannot overstate how refreshing Parasite is both as a genius piece of arthouse cinema, but also a very contemporary comedy of errors.\n\nBong's direction is fun and playful as he successfully subverts what the audience is expecting with outrageous twists and shocking reveals. The house escape sequence is painstakingly crafted and suspenseful like an old Hitchcock classic. Meanwhile, Bong's dry humor befits his sweeping and precise direction for the comedy scenes, like the poverty flood sequence, wherein absurdist nonsense occurs all to convey Bong's overarching metaphor of this South Korean family leeching off of an affluent and apathetic wealthy household like a parasite themselves.\n\nBong's scathing satire is entertaining in his near surreal sense of humor to his biting social commentary on South Korea's income inequality. He effortlessly juxtaposes a carefree family living in an opulent manor atop a hill within an expensive neighborhood with the poor family's destitute existence barely surviving within their messy semi-basement home at the bottom of the hill. Hong Kyung-pyo's cinematography feels like every shot was thought out beforehand with endless precision and care. Yang Jin-mo's editing is so precise and wicked as he flies the audience all around this luxury home with cunning cuts. I really like Jung Jae-il's score of beautiful harmony and dissonant disruptions.\n\nYou will want to kill the rich as your indignation for the upper classic grows with every shallow pointless move made by the lucky few, while the many impoverished characters literally fight for survival with desperate cunning and ruthless ambition only possible by living in abject poverty. Bong makes his rich into people living in light and comfort, while the poor are subservient insects that crawl around like worthless bugs. Parasite is so sublime because it can be watched for pure entertainment value of a sly poor family manipulating gullible elites into paying them for various services, but Parasite also wades in deep waters of sympathy for its poor desperate souls.\n\nI could go on about the masterful craftsmanship of Parasite, but I really want to mention the phenomenal cast of Parasite. They each play very particular roles and deliver precise and riveting performances with a memorable charm and playful deviousness. Song Kang-ho kills it as Kim \"Mr. Kim\" Ki-taek. His versatile portrayal ranges from casual relaxation, paternal care, to vicious desperation. Song is just too funny to me. His every facial expression is carefully chosen and executed like a comedic pendulum. Lee Sun-kyun is loathsome as the callous and ignorant Park \"Mr. Park\" Dong-ik. Likewise, Choi Woo-shik is hilarious in his lackadaisical leading performance as Ki-woo a.k.a. \"Kevin.\" You are endeared to him immediately, but it's his acting fascinates you with every moment and word. I must commend Chang Hyae-jin for her tough and fearsome performance as the fearless mother Chung-sook. By the same note, Lee Jung-eun is fun as the spiteful and two-faced Moon-gwang.\n\nCho Yeo-jeong is hilarious as the gullible and ignorant rich wife Yeon-kyo \"Madame\". She effortlessly plays the overly worrisome and obnoxious fake with a stunning flabbergasted face. She truly beautiful in Parasite, but it's her genuinely laugh out loud funny performance that had me constantly roaring. I adore Choi Se-yeon's stunning costumes for Cho Yeo-jeong. Similarly, Jung Ji-so is wonderful as the sweet and gentle daughter Da-hye. I must admit I completely fell in love with Ki-jung a.k.a. \"Jessica from Chicago\" played by the lovely Park So-dam. Her flawless performance in Parasite is my favorite aspect of this delightful indie film. Park is so charming, endearing, and sly as a fox with her quick-thinking, criminal chameleon.\n\nOverall, Parasite is an outstanding South Korean dark comedy that will stand up to the ages as Bong Joon-ho's immaculate direction and scorching script alone with preserve Parasite. Let alone Parasite's god tier ensemble of talented actors and actresses transforming themselves into clever charlatans and the disgustingly affluent.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Feb 01, 2020", "text": "A rollercoaster of a movie experience, I never knew what to expect next.

Go watch.\n\n*SPOILER FILLED REVIEW BELOW*\nThis should win the Oscar for the best Picture. Hands down. There is no other movie nominated that says so much, with so much depth to it's message. The cast is so impeccably acted, and The Score is John Williams-esque. It is as close to a perfect movie as I've seen since Mad Max: Fury Road, or Moonlight, or maybe Lady Bird(alright I guess I'm diminishing it, but those movies are fucking good is all I'm saying!). \n\nThis movie is a movie about income inequality plain and simple. It's pretty obvious, it doesn't try to pretend to be pretentious or im14andthisisdeep. You start off with an extremely poor family who live in what seems to be the slums of South Korea. The first act is giving you an idea of this family's dynamics, everyone's role. The cast has such incredible chemistry, not in a million years would you be able to guess  they weren't a real family if they were put in a police lineup and then were to go on about their day as everyone watched. \n\nYou would think nothing would ever break this family apart. and that's kinda the point. This family aspires desperately for a wealthier future, but given the choice between wealth and family, they would always pick the latter. Basically, the Son has a friend he grew up with who is going to study abroad. His family is wealthy enough to go to university and he wanted to give his old tutoring job to the son. \nAt first, you think, \"What a good friend. He basically gave this easy tutor job to his down on his luck childhood friend since the tutoring is for a young girl whose family is extremely well off\". \nThe friend then explains he's been tutoring this young girl for 2 years. Meaning she was in 8th grade (Junior High in the US) when he started tutoring her as he was in college. The protagonist asks why would he offer him this opportunity and not a friend from college who has the type of resume they would be looking for? \n\nIn his explanation, you begin to see a beginning to the conflicts within this film. He first seems to be thoughtful because he doesn't want to his rich fratty/douchy friends getting anywhere near this sweet, innocent young girl. He goes on to say, he wants to ask her out when he gets back from abroad, because she will be in college then. He won't have to worry about the protagonist stealing this girl from him.\n\nShowing what he truly thinks of his childhood friend, explaining how the mother is \"simple\" so you won't have to try very hard to get the job. Now this doesn't seem to be ill-guided, I don't think he meant anything by it at all. This is just the first example the movie shows of the gap between the rich and the poor. \n\nI'm not gonna explain the whole movie, but the protagonist and his family go on to con the rich family into having all of their caretaker, driver, and tutoring jobs. Unknown to the rich family that they are all related or even know each other. \n\nAny problem the rich family may encounter from the poor family or any outside conflicts, it's as simple as a phone call, request, or an extra tip to \"the help\" and their worry is gone. \n\nWhere as the poor family is at a constant battle or struggle to keep the facade up while they have the first well paying jobs in years. Any conflict or problem faced by the poor family is a level of stress that the rich family would never bother to imagine due to the privilege they have lived. \n\nAs the movie goes on, every family member in the rich family, life gets better with the help of the protagonists family. The father learns to be a better husband and father. The mother has a better relationship with her husband and children. \n\nWithout a single inkling of the con the poor family has pulled. \n\nEvery single time the poor family's lives seem to be on the up and up, something drags them back down. Something being the solution to the rich family's problem or annoyances. \n\nIn the end, it doesn't matter how nice the rich family is, how friendly, how much they tip, how much they offer. It's not a solution to problems plaguing the poor or impoverished. It's simply an out, a way to make themselves get satisfaction of being a \"good\" person. \n\nIt's like seeing a homeless person and you think it's sad or depressing. You assume they are a drunk, an addict, or a criminal, that's how they got there. *I* wasn't the reason he's there. *I* didn't do that to him. *I* gave a nice tip to the taxi driver, or the waiter, or the guy busking by the subway the other day. \n\nAnd that's the main idea here. No one wants to take the blame, and at this point, you can't blame people who aren't the richest of the rich. This stuff started A LONG time ago... but does that mean you get to sit around and do nothing about it? I mean *You* didn't put those people there, right? \n\nClimate Change wasn't *me*, that was the big oil corporations. What am I supposed to do about that? \n\nWell, maybe if that is the answer you keep getting. I think this film wants us to stop asking that same question. Maybe it's time for us to ask, \"why does it have to be this way?\". Maybe if we start asking that, then *WE* can start to under what we are supposed to do about it.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Jan 31, 2020", "text": "Funny in a sad way.

That scamming family really was horrible, they really were parasites.

The brother was a scumbag. He was entrusted the HS girl by his buddy who gave him the rock gift and introduced the job opportunity to him.

The father's whole philosophy about having no plan being the infallible plan I disagree with, that's just an excuse for being impulsive and lazy, which is what they are- complete losers. In fact all of the philosophy of that movie I disagree with- that poverty is an excuse for moral depravity. Morality is absolute, not situational and not relative. I got the deeper philosophical point of the movie, I just disagree. The crazy basement guy had motive other than being crazy. And the father had even less logical reason to go berserk. Sure maybe he was upset that his daughter was hurt and Mr. Park only cared about his family and his son, but if his main concern was his daughter he would've grabbed the keys and the daughter and driven her off- not tossed the keys and stabbed the guy and made things worse. It just seemed like gratuitous violence for the sake of empty shock value.

My father, who was practically an amateur critic, would showcase and present me his favorite feature films that he had progressed and expanded in his life of several decades. He rates movies and declares on watching them in a conceited method. Using movie ratings, any movie that seems to have approached over 80% on Rotten Tomatoes, he would give it a watch. Any movie over 90%, he would definitely watch. Any movie under any of those ratings, he believes it as waste of time. With this unhealthy mentality being exposed to me ever since I was a kid, my criticism for films has come to become overwhelmingly harsh. My ratings for films would be far lower than the average viewer that I conversed/interacted/viewed. I would dock points and be disappointed for a film if I had noticed a flaw of any kind, small or big. For almost 18 years, I have watched films. And I have begun to think that I had the special mind of a \"critic\" where it was far more challenging to impress me in any aspect compared to the average viewer. Sure, this mentality may cause many people to think that I was simply a picky, foolish teenager that was far too cocky with their tastes. I have recognized this. But it was reasonable to a certain extent. I tend to think about films as they progress and surprisingly, 100% of all films I have watched, I would always be left slightly or far disappointed because I was able to predict/expect how the film was to reach its peak or how it was to end. A clear example is the film Knives Out. A mystery film released in late 2019, it has received spectacular reviews. Many say that it was one of the best films they have watched in their life. I had the chance to watch it the past week with high expectations. My experience was a complete contrast to that of the reviews. Unfortunately, I was practically able to depict how the film was going to resolve, who the \"perpetrator\" was, and so on much before its climax. Maybe if I had watched the film without analyzing every shot, I would have enjoyed the film. But this is who I am. I do this and that is how I watch films. Of course, the film industry has evolved into a market that is pervaded with halfwitted big-budget CGI films for viewers with quite simple mindsets of having an effortless fun experience at the movies with friends or family, which I cannot stress, is perfectly fine. But for viewers such as me, who love to analyze films and watch them like it if it was a form of art, the modern generation of filmography has become far bland, with most being - ahem* excuse me - shit. From big-budget, low effort Chinese funded films to \"popular\" trendy \"superhero\" films, the market has evolved into something that was not a delightful experience for me. This directly connects to my initial mentality. I have watched many many classics ranging from a multitude of genres. With a father with a strict process of watching and rating films, I have fetched a similar mentality, possibly far more stern and harsh than one of my father's. But because our generation of films has degraded in quality, in the artistic aspect anyway, it is rare for me to have given a film that is over a 9/10 on my rating scale. In fact, I have practically accepted that a movie that was so perfect to have received a 10/10 on \"my\" scale would be virtually infeasible. In the hundreds of reviews I have written for films, there was some sort of negative nitpicking that had left me unsatisfied \"perfectly\". This, as a result, has left me to accept that I could never be fully 100% satisfied with any film in the upcoming future or in the near past.\n\nBut today, everything has changed. A few hours ago, I was able to receive the opportunity to watch the film Parasite directed and written by Bong Joon-Ho. I have watched many of Bong's films from the classic The Host - which I can confidently recommend to many people - to Okja, his most recent film, linked and partnered with Netflix. After watching Okja, I was left immensely disappointed and I am quite guilty to say that I had lost all respect for Bong's spectacular storytelling and cinematography. But after watching Parasite today, I could accept that is by the far the best film I have watched in my life and I have gained this newfound respect, far massive than something I had before.\n\nI went inside the theaters with exceedingly high expectations and as it began, I formed many scenarios of how it was to resolve and thinking of how I could match this film to a genre. Not once in my life, even after watching hundreds of classics that so-called \"revolutionized\" the film industry, have I became so immersed with the film to have been left disappointed that the film had ended. It was almost as if I was able to finally \"feel\" the great emotion of being amazed by a film, so much that it would leave me with \"no words\". As the film caught on, I completely forgot about my habit of \"analyzing\" due to the immense immersion I was in and for the first time, I was able to have the reaction to that of the average viewer. I believe that the Parasite is far superior to any classic film that people believe that revolutionized Hollywood. Many resort to saying that Hitchcock was the ultimate film director, completely revolutionizing cinematography using his new-wide skills of contemporary film shots and robust scenarios. But what Bong did was something much more than that. In a generation where everything has been discovered and finding a new creative method to film something is unrealistic, that is what Bong has done with Parasite. What Bong did was that rather than creating a simple \"good\" film with fine acting and fine screenplay writing and fine cinematography, he has invented a new genre of films. He has truly revolutionized the modern film industry, something that I believed was simply irrational to even consider. Parasite has defeated me. I could not predict it not once. I could not even consider how it was to go on. The only question I had the entire film was \"Okay, what the hell is next? Where is this going? How the fuck can you even end this?\". But in fact, he did end it. And it was not a disappointing one. It left me with an open mouth. No words. I would sit through the entire credits without saying or moving. I was just thinking to myself \"Holy fucking shit.\". On the drive home, I was thinking \"Holy fucking shit.\". For many hours at home after, I was thinking \"Holy fucking shit.\".\n\nI did have one disappointing thought about the film. And it was not about the film at all. As a Korean-American, who is very very familiar with Korean culture and being able to fluently speak it as well, I was able to watch it with ease without translations. Parasite is a Korean film. And because it was a Korean film, it was a film derived from Korean culture. As I watched the film, I could only be left disappointed that for some scenarios, the translations strayed away from its original meaning. But I cannot complain, some parts of Korean culture and language are just not possible to translate on paper perfectly for American viewers. That is my disappointment. I am sad that American viewers, who do not understand the Korean language or culture, cannot spectate the film as I have, who fully understood the hints that only one of a Korean viewer could catch. (As a side note for American viewers who were unfamiliar with Korean language or culture and you happen to learn or become familiar with Korean culture or language, I highly recommend that you watch it once more, it just makes the film so much better and polished.)\n\nRegarding the film, I could write pages and pages about my internal thoughts about the film. In fact, I am confident that I could write an entire book regards to my reaction and thoughts about the film. But it is pointless. When you attempt to explain this film to another, you cannot. The only way to know is to have watched it yourself. I cannot review this film. I cannot explain this film simply as a viewer. I cannot talk about how \"good\" the plot was or how \"good\" the screenplay was. It was none of those things. It was just\u2026.how would I say it\u2026..a film made by Bong and only Bong. My final thought? The only thing I can say is to fucking watch it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRating: 10/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: I have noticed that it has been nominated for Oscar's best picture as well. I have watched every nominee film (except for Little Women which I will hopefully be able to watch before the Oscar's). Any other film, in comparison to the Parasite is complete child's play. It is like comparing a film made by a high school freshman to that of a professional. While I am aware that the chances of a foreign film winning an Oscar Best Picture are very slim, I hope it holds out as I believe that the traction it may cause may once again inspire the film market to create new contemporary films so that I can once again, possibly rate another film a 10/10 in the future. Parasite has given me hope that film can evolve once more. I am selfish. And once could perceive me as cocky and a brainless immature teenager. But I could not give one fuck.

It seems that at the same time as the characters of the film took other people's social places, the same happened with the screenwriter: someone slammed him and tried to finish what was started. The first 20 minutes were really good, there was subtlety, surprise, interest. The final might not have been bad, but it didn't. But what happened from 21 minutes to the final credits was clearly done by a stupid layman who hastily wanted to cut down easy money: there is no plot, there is no development, there is no idea, at least there is no sense either. There is bad humor, prolonged inappropriate vulgarity and stupid performance. This part is a parasite of the first 20 minutes. It is stupid, meaningless, not funny, not sad, not professional, does not give reason to think about anything, and leaves nothing in the soul. A complete zero. 1.5 hour part of the stupid action just takes screen time. It is all far-fetched and lumped together with the ending invented by the real (killed earlier) screenwriter.\nSpoilers: Four antipodes hide under the table while the rich unsuspecting owners try to have sex in the same living room (the camera focuses the viewer's attention on the erogenous zones of men and women, probably so that the audience does not forget where someone has what button, there is no spiritual background, there is no need to stretch this scene), several times incomprehensible additional characters roll down the stairs (a three-time reference to Hitchcock, aliluya!), what else was there? Oh, Yes, the storm-sewer flow, as the reality of the lower \"basement\" social society, returned the heroes from heaven to earth! That's all, nothing else.\nTo give this nonsense at least some meaning, the parasites of the film business called the resulting film a \"Social satire\".\nIf the point is hidden precisely in making fun of the audience, showing that parasites are not only heroes, but also the script, then you can probably appreciate this work: the Cannes Palme d'or, five Oscar nominations. While it may be the purpose of high honors is to support the development koreyskogo cinema.

Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.\n\nHowever, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place.\n\nBut the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious \"haves vs. have-nots\" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain.\n\nBelieve the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "Jan 25, 2020", "text": "This movie is phenomenal.

There is nothing particularly original about the plot or the characterizations. The acting and direction are fine. The settings are interesting to say the least. The film unfolds somewhat like \"Shoplifters\"--impoverished but clever people who are holding the short end of the stick under our world-wide inequitable economic and social systems. The families in both films scrape by through guile while existing in a semi-underground setting (literally--their living quarters are below street level--and socially, they are disconnected from the fruits of bourgeois society, with no apparent prospects of climbing the ladder). \"Parasite\" begins well enough but soon drifts into an atmosphere of tension fostered by the creepy machinations of the family members--who seem to have no compunction in betraying the family friend who provides the reference affording them access to the wealthy household. The marks in their con game seem like decent enough folk given their typical (for their class) obliviousness to the inequities in the socioeconomic system that has rewarded them with luxury while forcing the less fortunate to grub out whatever existence they can manage. The film establishes no real basis for the destitute family's turn to enmity, or for that matter to abject stupidity with a beggars banquet farce that sets off the cataclysmic climax. The revelation of the safe room/fall-out shelter with its demented underground occupant may constitute a plausible metaphor for a number of things, including a rage that could rightfully simmer in the consciousness of exploited and repressed humanity. The cowboy and Indian farce no doubt has its own intended symbolic import. But the homicidal melee that concludes the film's action unfortunately reflects a deficit of imagination, at the same time suggesting the filmmakers' possible contempt for an audience that has been drawn in with a plot that early on masquerades as social comedy. The characters devolve into stick-figures in what amounts to little more than a nihilistic allegory.", "score": 2}, {"date": "Jan 21, 2020", "text": "Very interesting movie about the social environment we have around the world.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "Jan 21, 2020", "text": "Best movie this year by a mile .. easily makes my top ten best ever .. absolute masterpiece ", "score": 5}, {"date": "Jan 21, 2020", "text": "Utterly brilliant.

In this offbeat film our out of work, lower class protagonists do commit crimes by fraudulently claiming to have credentials that they do not possess but present themselves as tutors and cooks not drug dealers or pimps. We are inclined to be sympathetic to these people who are terribly disadvantaged and struggle to make a living but they are conniving and cruel to those lower than them when given the slightest taste of power. This forces us to consider whether to take on some rather indefensible moral positions or realize that there are few moral absolutes when it comes to matters of class warfare.\n\nThe Kim family live in one tiny house together in a neighborhood full of other unemployed people who are looked down upon by the nearby upper class. Their lives change when their intelligent son Ki-Woo, Choi Woo-Shik, is offered a job by his friend as a tutor for a member of the Park family, the wealthy Da-hye, Jeong Ji-so, who is the daughter of entrepreneur Dong-ik, Lee Sun-kyun. He has his crafty sister Ki-jeong, Park So-dam, create a fake university diploma for him and takes up the job after fooling her gullible mother Yeon-gyo, Cho Yeo-jyong. Soon the family decides that they will have to remove the existing employees of the Parks so that they can obtain jobs. They lie to them and claim that they are not related but when they remove longtime housekeeper Moon-gwang, Lee Jung-eun, she returns to help her husband Geun-sae, Park Myung-hoon, who has been secretly hiding in a bunker under the house for years. This causes conflict between the two families and when a party is held tensions erupt between the three different groups.\n\nThe title of the film was deceptive in a way as I expected this film to be a traditional horror in which an animal takes hold of the bodies of several people and tries to take over the world but the film was far from that. Yet the title still fits as without knowing it the Parks and their mansion is slowly infected by this lower class family who may seem benevolent and unassuming but present a real threat when left to their own devices. The somewhat dim Yeon-gyo is a product of her upbringing as we assume she has always been a member of the idle rich and has never been forced to claw her way up the food chain in order to gain wealth or security. Ki-Woo's mother Chung-sook, Chang Hyae-jin, is exactly the opposite as she has been forced to scrounge for whatever money she can get and actively pressures those around her to provide for her. This desperation may not be becoming but if we are honest it is what most poor people who were able to become wealthy by some miracle probably had. One must be ruthless in most situations to come out on top and when we meet Chung-sook and her family they have already experienced so much horror than they are completely cynical.\n\nThese qualities make it hard for us to like them as while Yeon-gyo is rich and an airhead she does not appear to take advantage of anybody and her ignorance is perhaps her worst trait. It is when the poor family find themselves with a measure of wealth and power when the Parks vacate their home for a few days that their true colors come out. With the return of Moon-gwang and the discovery of her husband in the bunker Chung-sook is given the option of either helping somebody in need of a break or handing her over to the police so that she and her family can enjoy the luxuries of the house alone. She takes the first option and is cruel to the former housekeeper even when she begs on her knees for some mercy. Then the tables are turned and there is a delicious moment in which the begging Moon-gwang gains the upper hand and her entire demeanor changes. These shifts in power occur throughout the film and allow us to consider what power does to people as they seem to lose their empathy when they gain it.\n\nThere are points where the film drags a little bit and I do not know if I would have made the epilogue quite so lengthy but the film is fascinating to dissect and deserves to be one of the most discussed of the year.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "Jan 20, 2020", "text": "Stunning!

I am reviewing a seamless, masterful medley of different genres of film all rolled into one. Parasite has elements of sidesplitting comedy, seat-clenching thriller, riveting drama and more. And they all have their time in the sun thanks to the spectacular juggling act by Bong Joon Ho. The filmmaker is so present in every scene- nay, in every shot. All of the film's technical elements meshed together in one of the most well-oiled machines I have ever seen on screen. I'll break down some of these in detail, but it bears repeating that Bong displays master craftsmanship in this textbook definition of a passion project.\n\nThe foundation of every film is its screenplay, and this one by Bong and Han Jin Won is exceptional. Aside from the aforementioned genre blending, this script tackles ever present themes of class warfare, social mobility, greed, manipulation, and power, to name a few. The icing on this cake is the highly witty and clever dialogue, which expertly delivers humor and theme at the same time. \n\nThe ensemble cast deserves far more recognition and praise than it is currently receiving. There was truly not one weak link. Every actor had shining moments where they displayed a layered, highly developed character. The standout is clearly Song Kang-ho, playing the father of the Kim family (arguably the protagonist). He displays the most vivid and defined character arc throughout the cast. A personal favorite of mine has to be Park So-dam, who played Ki-jung (Jessica) also of the Kim family. Her scenes earned well deserved laughter from the audience in my theater; the way she repeatedly bowls over Mrs Park is hilarious and memorable.\n\nOf all the masterful technical elements, the one that is most deserving of praise is the production design by Lee Ha-jun. The sets were so crucial to the storytelling and themes, and the detail that went into them provided so much. It bears mentioning that both the dirty alleyway of the Kim's home and the gorgeous home of the Parks were both built *entirely* from scratch. These two locations provided great insight into the circumstances of the two families, and the contrast between the two was thematically brilliant. The Park home in particular was superb; the cinematography (Hong Gyeong-pyo) completely immersed the audience in an intimate way. Alongside the design is the excellence of the editing. Mark my words- the montage where the Kims are plotting against the Parks' maid will be in film school masterclasses for decades to come. Finally, the music by Jung Jae-il greatly assisted in the film's constant shifting between moods and tones. \n\nThe one qualm I have with this film is that the rewatchability is somewhat low. But this is acceptable, given that the first time watch value is so incredibly high. Parasite is a technical marvel as well as a downright entertaining roller coaster. If you see only one film this awards season, make it Parasite.\n\n10/10.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Jan 17, 2020", "text": "Parasite is a brilliant film.

It's a rollercoaster ride with incredible screenplay and directing.

Song Kang Ho showcases such genuine emotion that you forget that this is a fictional script. All actors and actresses fervently commit to their roles and you see them as genuinely human. There are no villains here, which is why it makes the film so captivating. You don't know who you are rooting for or who you should be rooting for. The set of the movie is also noteworthy\u2014they created the poor neighborhood and the rich house from scratch!\n\nWhile this movie is in Korean, the movie explores a theme centered around class-struggle that is universal. The movie is centered around a rich family and a poor family, and how their lives eventually intertwine. You get to understand their family dynamics, economy, and their hopes (and also hopelessness). Even if you're not Korean, you will connect to this film. It's a film about people and socioeconomic classes, among other things.\n\nYou'll do yourself a disservice if you don't watch this movie!

I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.  \n\n\tAs I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.\n\n\tThe first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen. \n\nParasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.\n\nGrade- A+  \n\nBrody's TAKE 5", "score": 5}, {"date": "Jan 10, 2020", "text": "you can't really argue this", "score": 5}, {"date": "Jan 09, 2020", "text": "I\u2019ve been feeling very underwhelmed by films in general theses last few years.

Arguably the best film I have seen in 2019, Bong Joon Ho fills this masterpiece with metaphors throughout and utilizes mise-en-sc\u00e8ne to add depth and symbolism to the film's theme, story and ultimately to help guide the audience to the message he wants to convey.\nThe film's expertly written script has the right type of story beats to add layers to the world we see on screen and to introduce the inciting plot element at the right moment. The script builds off of that point in the film and smartly keeps the audience guessing and processing the events as they unfold on the screen. It all comes full circle in the film's final act that paints a rather harsh but truthful reality that many of us sometimes have to come to grips with in life.\nThought provoking and pulse pounding, Parasite is a film that deserves to be seen by all on the big screen.

Incisive, wicked, intelligent, dark (and funny)\u2026 one of the best films in years.\n\nif you haven't seen Parasite, go see it. It's a stunning achievement and one of the tightest, most sophisticated, clever, and intimate films of the 2010s, if not further. It's clear that director Bong Joon Ho had a vision, one that he expertly and concisely executed: One part struggle between the haves and have-nots (less economic anxiety and more class mobility), and one part darkly intrinsic look at family, society, and belonging. Without spoiling much that isn't in the trailers\u2026\n\nThe film follows the impoverished Kims, living in the underbelly of Seoul\u2014father Ki-Taek (Kang-Ho Song), mother Chung Sook (Hye-Jin Jang), son Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi), and daughter Ki-Jung (So-Dam Park)\u2014taking whatever odd jobs they can (the film opens on one\u2014folding pizza boxes). But a chance opportunity for Ki-Woo to tutor a wealthy family's daughter sets the stage for the film. It's not spoiling to say that the entire Kim family soon weasels their way into service for the wealthy family, the Parks, and more specifically the mother, Yeon-Kyo (Yeo-Jeong Jo).\n\nWatching the Kims infiltrate the Park household during the first half of the film is a sight to behold: Darkly comedic, whip smart, and incredibly incisive in its observation of both family's worldview. \"They are rich, but still nice,\" quips Ki-Taek. \"They are nice because they are rich,\" retorts his wife. A lesser movie would devolve into a clumsily depiction of a class war (eat the rich!), but the nuance and shades of grey Director Bong uses to create his characters and their world is as thought-provoking as it is entertaining.\n\nRather, Parasite becomes something else entirely\u2026 something darker. From the turning point\u2014you'll know it when you see it\u2014Director Bong really begins to twist audience expectation. In a relatively quick timeframe (in-movie time), the Kims, the Parks, and others find themselves in a series of incidents that are equal parts thrilling, vicious, and deeply saddening. The thrill ride the Parasite takes you on in the second half is indescribable without spoiling, but know that it's edge of your seat gripping, while still managing to keep its darkly humorous tone. By film's end, Parasite leaves you utterly floored and slightly hopeful, but only just so.\n\nThroughout the 131 minute runtime, but most vividly in the second half, Director Bong is working at the height of his powers. Without any fat or indulgence, Parasite is laser-focused on its satire of socioeconomic disparity. It doesn't beat the audience over the head with a hammer (like other notable 2019 films\u2026 cough, Joker), rather it surgically penetrates your psyche. It isn't black and white, there are no good or bad. There are only people. People in two distinctly different worlds. And ultimately, the choices these characters make to create their version of existence.\n\nHighlights: The camerawork, storytelling, and set design are astounding: No wasted space, no self-indulgent sets, and no extraneous storytelling. This entire film is a master at work. Parasite bursts with so much that it's impossible to highlight without spoiling.\n\nMVP: Park So-Dam turns in an aloof, yet charismatic performance as Kim Ki-Jung. And Yeo-Jeong Jo as Park Yeon-Ko dazzles as the bored, eager-to-please, worrying mother.\n\nShould you see it: You shouldn't be reading this, you should be buying a ticket right now. 10/10.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Dec 07, 2019", "text": "Like nothing you'll ever see.

The economic inequality between people from different social classes is played out so enticingly well. The thoughts and behaviors that connect people and promote closeness among their personal interactions within their class is examined and shown so clearly. The ending is so perplexing.

Outstanding acting and beautiful blocking allow Parasite to fill above and beyond the usual film, but what really shines is the script. A story difficult to place in terms of genre, it manages to lead the viewer towards each designed motion.

Heavily infused with social commentary and satire, yet subtle enough to avoid any preachiness, this is the story of two families: the unemployed Kims are the lower class who lives in a tiny, literally sub-street level, apartment while the wealthy, upper class Parks luxuriate in a huge modern designer house. When an opportunity arises for Kim's son to tutor the Park's daughter, the Kims begin an elaborate plan to infiltrate the Park family. Just as you think you are settling in for an invasion thriller, the film pivots into an unexpectedly revelatory and gripping middle section that plays out like a tense hide-and-seek heist and culminates in an exquisite finale so jaw-droppingly outrageous that it can only happen in a Korean film. Using every cinematic language available dextrously to deliver something complex and thought-provoking, its cinematography is awe-inspiring (and pops even more on the big screen) and every screen composition and production design is brimming with meaning and specific significance. Minor contrivances in the plotting aside, the cleverly constructed script not only juxtaposes well the manner the Kims connive to better themselves with the Parks' obliviousness and inability to appreciate what they have, but refuses to give in to simple characterisations or resolutions. The Kims may be devious and ruthless but they are also aspirational and hard workers and good people at heart.

NOTE: 8/10", "score": 4}, {"date": "Nov 20, 2019", "text": "Parasite is a fascinating film because, while it consistently maintains focus on the same topic, it is constantly changing the style and genre of the film. At times it\u2019s a comedy, then it\u2019s a thriller, then it\u2019s a con-artist/hustler movie, then it\u2019s a horror film, etc. There are surprises around every corner in this movie, and that made it riveting to watch. I never once felt that I knew what was going to happen next, and that is such a freeing experience. I also have to commend Parasite for threading the needle and making a movie with protagonists who are unlikable, but getting me to care about them. It\u2019s weird, but the way the film sets up their plan, it has just enough comedy that I kind of enjoy watching the devious plot unfold. There\u2019s a twisted pleasure in seeing people that are clever enough to be a few steps ahead of everyone, even if their intentions are selfish. The cast of the film was wonderful, and many of them had to take on complex roles where they basically require 2 distinct personalities. However, Parasite wasn\u2019t pure joy for me. I got annoyed later in the film that these people who seem so savvy start to behave like morons. The one thing that I could clearly predict in the film was something that they didn\u2019t even seem to consider as a possibility. It isn\u2019t a huge fault in the story, but it seems inconsistent with the characters that we see carefully planning so many details. I also thought at times Bong Joon-Ho went a little overboard with messaging in the movie. While it\u2019s fairly obvious that the entire film is focusing on the differences in classes within Korean culture, it\u2019s not like I need multiple scenes of people peeing in the streets to show the lousy living conditions of some people. There\u2019s even a massive flood that doesn\u2019t play into the plot in any way but to show the night-and-day difference between these two families. Despite any minor complaints, Parasite is a truly unique film, and one I can\u2019t wait to watch again in order to pick up on all the details I missed the first time.

It was a struggle for me to keep myself as far away as I possibly could from reviews and articles about the film, but I am glad I did so, because I truly believe the best way to see it is to know nothing about it beforehand. \nParasite revolves around two families, one living in poverty, barely having enough money to eat every night, and the other, spoilt for riches, struggling to decide what to eat each night. The first half of the film shows the families interacting through an elaborate scheme that sees the entirety of the poverty-stricken family working under the same roof as the wealthy family.\n It is hard to reveal any more about the story without taking the experience away from the viewer, but what I can say is, the complete shift of tone halfway through turns this film from a dark comedy into a thrilling drama. It is a true testament to director Bong Joon-Ho that the film can change tone so frequently without creating unrest. Every tonal shift brings the audience along with it; you will be laughing one minute and in complete shock the next. Every scene is important to the direction the film takes, even the numerous, lengthy tracking shots have significant meaning behind them. There is one scene in particular, where the gradual build-up of tension explodes into one of the captivating twists that you will see this year.\nThe cinematography, production design and directing piece together the two halves of the world perfectly. The juxtaposition of the two houses that the characters reside in, are almost characters in themselves. The characters personalities change depending on which house they are positioned in, and the natural events occurring in the world can have significant repercussions on one house, but would leave the other unscathed. \nThere really isn't much you can say wrong about this film. It is one of the best films I have seen this year and perhaps even this decade.\nBong Joon-Ho gives such a unique take on poverty and the class differential that occurs worldwide.

Joon-ho and Han Jin-won's screenplay (in addition the former's understated directing job) is excellent with perfect pacing that beautifully flows from scene to scene, and once he's done laying all his cards on the table, Joon-ho springs a set of vicious narrative traps that escalate into a thrilling, almost totally new film whose every minute is better than the last.\n\nWhether it's a casual passing remark, joke, or calculatingly placed visual, every single detail gradually coalesces into an immaculately tight piece about the relational tension between society's haves and have-nots. It's flooring not just how much, but how synergistically and open to interpretation Joon-ho crafts his film, particularly in his impressive ongoing visual motif contrasting the power disparity between high and low height levels.

Now I would personally recommend going into this knowing nothing, but if you insist on having a small inkling, this is about a family of four, all of which are unemployed.  They get gifted with a rock that is said to bring its owner fortune, and they find themselves gradually becoming gainfully employed by a wealthy family under false pretenses.  How long will they be able to keep the ruse up?  Like I said before, I went into this knowing as little as possible about this on purpose.  What little I had seen recommended that I approach it in such a fashion, and Joon-Ho Bong is such a talented director that I heeded the warning.  I watched a trailer and that was about it, and I was careful to avert my eyes if anything popped up on social media.  I wasn't even sure what genre this would fall under, and that is the best way to take this movie in if at all possible.  Now what I most appreciated about Parasite is how many layers it has to it.  Sure, you can view this as a microcosm for a capitalistic society, and that all works, but even if you don't do that extra legwork, you can still get behind this twisty story as it is presented to you.  It is so rare that a movie can actually pull a surprise in this day and age, and even when you are sensing something big is about to happen, Parasite is excellent at constantly catching you off guard in a way that you don't see coming.  Even very early on with this, something is off and the story won't allow you to quite put your finger on it.  It pulls you in with this heist-like setup, and then it flips the script entirely.  Much like this family, it has got you hook, line and sinker, and you have an inherent need to see how this story is going to play out.  I never knew really at any point where this movie was going to end up, and for somebody who watches as many movies as I do, it made for a completely engrossing experience.  I just saw this three days ago and I can't stop thinking about it.  Joon-ho Bong blends genres seamlessly, and this covers comedy, thriller, mystery, and horror in the best way possible.  The dynamics of the story are always changing which is sure to make it an absorbing watch.  This was one of the few movies of 2019 that I went into with high expectations and they were all met.

Caught in the wildly unpredictable intersection of two South Korean families, we flow, over 132 roller coaster minutes, from slice of life satire to laugh out loud comedy to murder mystery to thriller to horror. We first meet the Kim family: former Olympian medalist, no-nonsense mom, philosophic dad and their twenty-something children, a clever, jaded daughter and a cagey, articulate son. Together they live in a cramped subbasement with a single window opening to an alley frequented by urinating drunks. Cobbling together pay-as-you-go jobs, the destitute family of four assemble pizza boxes and post advertisement fliers but still can\u2019t stretch their collective earnings to prevent cellphone shutdown. I was instantly empathetic as they doggedly scramble about their tiny, cluttered basement quarters looking for an unprotected neighborhood wireless signal to hijack. Who amongst us can\u2019t identify with the duress and agitation of no internet? I remember wandering around my backyard one blustery night during a power outage holding up my open laptop searching for a signal and happily tucking myself in the corner woodpile to draft off a neighbor\u2019s service. We are won over by these Kims, a likable and resourceful pack, resigned to underclass status, not from lack of will or skill, but as victims of ravaging unemployment. Marked by a distinct working class odor from subway travel and basement travails, let\u2019s call them \u201cdown but not out.\u201d Next up, their polar economic opposites, the Park family: fashionable, fretting mom, high tech dad, preening adolescent daughter and hyperkinetic young son. This family of four live in 1% luxury, their home a gated modern mansion of renown architectural pedigree, tended by a chirpy Brady Bunch Alice-type maid and chauffeured in a top of the line classic black Mercedes-Benz. We common folk cruise along voyeur-like momentarily drinking in the fascinating lifestyle of fame and fortune. As most of us are interlopers to the decadence spawned by riches, the Park family are never in danger of generating empathy, but neither do they stir antipathy. A family of nouveau wealth, deemed \u201cof course\u201d entitled to servants, they deflect lurking presumptions of elitism by pointing out that they pay their staff more than the market rate. Call them \u201cnice.\u201d From the introductory phase of meet the Kims, greet the Parks, the plot flirts with a quasi Prince and Pauper remix, here a twist, there a turn, here a sting, there a caper. Out with the old (the Park support staff), in with the new (the Kim conniving crew). We enjoy the antics of the two families bizarrely blended by means and needs, schemes and scams. It\u2019s a fun frolic! Then ominous storm clouds roll in, thunder booming as the Park\u2019s original merry maid stages a dramatic return, throwing a lighting bolt of double dealing deception causing the walls of hoax and trickery to come a-tumbling down. It\u2019s not fun anymore. It\u2019s frightening and vicious. The once comedic clash between social classes turns into a literal flood of ugly, cruel, vindictive and murderous rage. Suddenly, I\u2019m watching a cinematic detonation, the black comedy explodes into thriller, then slasher, splaying the complex social, cultural and economic layers wide open, leveling the playing field of the haves and the have nots in an astonishing, jaw-dropping final\u00e9. Don\u2019t let anyone persuade you that Parasite represents a societal showdown between good and evil.

It\u2019s best to go into \u201cParasite,\u201d the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you\u2019re about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it\u2019s the story of two families of four. You\u2019ll watch knowing you\u2019re in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it\u2019s over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo\u2019s father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can\u2019t imagine (or don\u2019t care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that\u2019s been boiled. Ki-woo\u2019s family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie\u2019s themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song\u2019s stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun\u2019s swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi\u2019s eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust. At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one\u2019s family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It\u2019s explosive filmmaking on every level.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Nov 06, 2019", "text": "Insightful, unexpected, several movies in one.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Nov 06, 2019", "text": "One of the best movies of the year.

I am not a huge foreign movie guy, but I am absolutely trying. I saw The Farewell earlier this year, I saw Pain & Glory (review coming soon) and I saw Parasite. Parasite is the newest movie from acclaimed Director Bong Joon-ho. I was excited to learn about this guy and I will be diving into his filmography soon because I LOVED this movie.\n\nParasite is a story about a family who slowly embeds themself with a wealthy across the town. The do this by slowly taking over all the positions in the household. They maneuver the son to become the tutor, they maneuver the daughter as another tutor, they bring in their dad as the driver and the mom as the maid. Now they have to do some bad (but sometimes funny) things in order to achieve this, but the movie does a great job of making it seem natural.\n\nThe true greatness in this movie though lies in the tone. The way Joon-ho maneuvers your emotions from laughing to freaking out between scenes is unlike you see in very many movies. The way it is paced only only helps that tone because they never linger on anything which makes bouncing from the suspense to the comedy so easy. The tone also helps balance the class commentary throughout the movie. Clearly the director wants people to understand natural life in Korea and commenting on the classes was the best way to do that.\n\nStock Watch\n\nStock Up \u2013 Bong Joon-ho made waves with Okja and he is continuing the hot streak as I said above. This guy just seems like a Kubrick type where his movies really try to put a spin on genres, from what I have read. This was a masterclass in filmmaking and I will watch anything he does from now on. I mean look at him he clearly has cool friends\u2026\n\n*A couple other tidbits\n\nWhen you first see the maid hanging from the wall pushing the bookcase you are like WTF. Easily second best WTF moment this year behind Midsommar.\n\nThe romance between the son and daughter of the two families was a little weird.\n\nParasite is easily the biggest surprise of the year for me, and I honestly wish people could make more movies like this. Yeah its not 100% perfect but its original and was gripping from start to finish. This is me telling you Parasite is a good movie\u2026\n\nJuice Rating:\n92/100", "score": 5}, {"date": "Nov 05, 2019", "text": "Parasite is the kind of movie that lingers with you for days, months, if not years.

The multiple layers of struggle placed upon each character only adds to the brilliance of the story and culminates with an even greater crescendo when their whole lives start falling apart.

This is a movie that will make you think long after the movie is over (and it's a long one).", "score": 5}, {"date": "Nov 03, 2019", "text": "SEOUL SURVIVORS - My Review of PARASITE (4 1/2 Stars)\n\nIt would be understandable to watch the first ten minutes of Parasite, the new film from Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, The Host) and think you've stumbled into an alternate universe version of Shoplifters.  Both feature an Asian family of grifters living in a hovel and preying on people with money.  Both won the prestigious Cannes Film Festival's top prize a year apart.  While both excellent films, Parasite is to Shoplifters what No Strings Attached was to Friends With Benefits. I won't chase comparisons any further than that, because Parasite is a staggering work of art worth putting on its very own pedestal.  \n\nBong Joon Ho has delighted in subverting our expectations within specific genres, whether it's a monster movie, a chase film, or an environmental issues farce.  His films have often explored the marked differences between the haves and the have nots.  With Parasite, he and co-writer Han Jin Won bring this social dichotomy to the world of the home invasion thriller, creating a masterful, screw-tightening, devastatingly powerful gut punch of a movie.  \n\nI'll set up the basic premise but spoil nothing in this review, as the surprises merit fresh eyes.  The Kim family live in a damp basement apartment which affords them a view of drunken men urinating right outside their street level window.  They subsist on odd jobs like folding pizza boxes and dream of better lives which they can see on their iPhones whenever they're able to piggyback onto their neighbor's WiFi.  This foursome, played by Kang-ho Song, a Bong Joon Ho regular, as the father Ki-taek, Hye-jin Jang as the mother Chung-sook, Woo-Sir Choi as the young son Ki-woo and So-dam Park as the daughter, deserve a break.  \n\nGood fortune strikes them one day when Ki-woo's friend tells informs him he's traveling overseas and needs him to cover for him as an English tutor for the daughter the wealthy Park family of four.  Ki-woo impresses the parents, who live in a sleek modern mansion in a well-to-do section of Seoul.  The father, Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee) owns a tech company and has the shuffling gait of a man used to his creature comforts.  The mother, Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo) oozes compassion and beauty despite not always being aware of her surroundings.  They raise their young children in a bubble which gets burst wide open with the arrival of Ki-woo.  Soon, enough, the rest of the Kim family insidiously infiltrates the Parks' lives, and my story description ends here.  \n\nNeedless to say, Parasite draws you in with its basic premise and then, like the best of Hitchcock and Kubrick, turns it on its ear and makes you gasp.  The majority of the film delights in revealing every little shift which occurs in that gorgeously stark home until you slowly realize that everything has changed.  In an instant, however, things go bonkers (you'll know it when you see it), but it doesn't so much feel like a tonal shift as it feels like an organic extension of our poor family's desperation.  The film doesn't feature a human antagonist.  The Kim's do what they need to do to survive in a tough world, and the Parks are mostly kind to their employees, although they do separate themselves a bit by noticing that poor people have certain smells.  It's enough of a detail to evoke a ton of empathy for the Kims.\n\nMake no mistake.  This is a movie-movie.  It has grand set pieces and almost unbearable suspense.  I've never before witnessed the preparing of a ramen type dish in the context of a nail-biting moment, but there it is for Bong Joon Ho to mess with his audience for several agonizing minutes.  Same goes for a sliding shelf door, a living room table, a light switch, a flooding apartment, and an innocent enough outdoor party.  What the filmmaker seems to be saying is that what separates the classes is merely a thin veneer.  We're all one tiny moment away from losing everything.  \n\nIt doesn't hurt that the assembled cast shines.  I especially loved the interplay between Kang-ho and Hye-jin as the parents.  Their increasingly dire circumstances bring them closer together with each showing the other tenderness despite the mayhem. I also loved Yeon-kyo's guileless performance as the too-easily impressed mom.  Had she done a little Googling, she may have prevented what ensues, but she seems to love people, so it's hard to hate her.  \n\nFor a moment near the end, the air leaks out of the tires with a sequence slightly out of step with what precedes it.  I should have known better to question it, as Bong Joon Ho is a master filmmaker.  Of course it would swing around again to produce an unforgettably heartbreaking final moment.  It's up there with the great movie endings.  \n\nBong Joon Ho uses everything in his powers to achieve this instant classic. His cinematographer, Kyung-pyo Hong, understands how to present space in a frame and how to mine suspense out of every slight camera move.  Ha-jun Lee's production design presents a vivid contrast between the two main homes.  Jail Jung's orchestral score gives the film an appropriate heft, worthy of such big flights of musical fancy.  Parasite is a movie of its time as each of us circle around the ever-diminishing musical chairs.  We don't know when the music will stop, but when it does, some of us are in for a world of hurt.

The movie opens with a four-piece family (husband, wife, son, daughter) shackled to poverty, all unemployed, making do with what they can get, when, suddenly, through the kindness of a friend, the son acquires a job tutoring the daughter of a very wealthy, identically four-pieced family. The newly hired son, together with his jobless sister, father, and mother, then concoct an elaborate scheme to get all of them, one by one, hired by the rich family, with the sister posing as an art tutor for the rich family's \"ingenious\" little boy, the father becoming the new chauffeur (after framing the old one), and the mother enlisting as the new housekeeper (after taking advantage of the old one's particular allergic reaction). This is only the basic setup of the movie; there is much, much more that happens afterward, and it only keeps getting better. The movie is simply fantastic, not just because of its exhilarating plot or its multi-angled perspective on class and societal dynamics, but also due to its impeccable acting.

The story centers around a disenfranchised, and disaffected young man and a hapenstannce invitation to tutor an extremely rich family's daughter from a friend. The means by which he gains the position are dubious at best, utilizing forgery, lies and deception of a bumbling grifter.

The cinematography while masterful also blocks characters within each shot to create an almost imperceptible yet effective implied line that furthers the films tense feel as it approaches it's climax/resolution. The final act of the film is where Bong's directorial style and underlying message straight up sucker punches you in the gut. Gone is the light-hearted humor that we see from the onset and now in full force is a completely different story of a family hanging onto financial and familial stability that is only afforded to the elite in this world that is terrifyingly reminiscent of our current society. Who is the true parasite? The wealthy who have no conception of their fortune or the lying conartist that  take advantage of that blas\u00e9 attitude to gain purchase in a broken economy? While this change in thought and mindset clearly strikes the viewer as bleak there still is humor in this shift, just of a more cynical and dark nature.

The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Oct 30, 2019", "text": "Awesome flick.

Movie should go down in history as one of the best films of the decade.", "score": 5}, {"date": "Oct 28, 2019", "text": "Director Bong Joon Ho has been on my radar for years now, as I believe him to be one of the best storytellers out there right now. Admittedly, I haven't seen the majority of his films but his two most recent works in Snowpiecer and Okja were among the best films of their consecutive years. I thought both of those films were great, so I was very eagerly awaiting his newest film, Parasite. After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen.\n\nTo go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension.\n\nThe biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is.\n\nWonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way.\n\nIt's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it. I will just say that certain aspects may not work for everyone. Parasite is a perfect example of why I love movies so much. A great, engaging story that surprises you from start to finish, along with one of the best crews to work on a film yet this year. I can't praise this film enough. This Korean language film has broken through and I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if it takes home the award for best foreign film and even a nomination for best picture.

In a way, it's also his defense mechanism, because it guards him from feeling like a failure or deluding himself into thinking he's someone he's not. \n\nKi-taek (Song Kang Ho) is a weary-looking man of about 50 whose main source of solace is his family, and like many like many men living in his scruffy neighborhood, which sits at the bottom of a hilly city in South Korea, Ki-taek has fallen on harsh economic times. He lives in a low-ceilinged, elbow-to-wall apartment with his wife Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) and their two twentysomething children\u2014son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam). \n\nAs a family, the Kims are close, resourceful and band together to make ends meet, such as tapping into nearby Wi-Fi networks for free Internet access and performing odd jobs like folding mounds of pizza boxes for a meager paycheck they all share. Naturally, the Kims desire a higher standard of living, and so when Ki-woo's college-educated friend, Min (Park Seo-joon), suggests Ki-woo take over his job as English tutor for the daughter of an affluent family, the other members of the Kim household think it could be an opportunity for all of them to reap the benefits of a rich lifestyle.\n\nAnd so, one by one, the Kims scheme their way into the employ of the rich Park family, whose posh, modern mansion sits high above the city slums. Their serene home is everything the Kim's is not, with 10-foot high ceilings; shiny, wooden floors; large, classy furniture; a fully stocked refrigerator and pantry; a heavily fortified garage; and a fully enclosed backyard with green grass and lush, perfectly maintained landscaping. Who wouldn't want a piece of this luxury pie?\n\nShortly after Ki-woo impresses Mrs. Park (Cho Yeo-jeong) with his tutelage skills and entices her and her business tycoon husband (Lee Sun-kyun) to hire him as the new English teacher for their daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), Ki-jung manages to get hired as the art teacher and child therapist to the Park's rambunctious son, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Ki-jung then plants a piece of incriminating evidence that gets the current chauffer fired, allowing Ki-taek to promptly fill the position, in spite of his notable stench. They then work on getting the longtime, dedicated housekeeper (Lee Jung-eun) canned, and who should come along at just the right time but Chung-sook. Soon enough, the entire Kim clan, each assuming a fake identity, makes up the Park's household staff and are quickly basking in the rich family's amenities, going so far as to ransack their fridge, get drunk, and squat in their house when the Parks decide to go camping for the weekend.\n\nGiven this somewhat silly and lighthearted setup, why isn't it until late in the film that we come to learn of Ki-taek's solemn \"no plan\" policy? Because up until about the halfway mark, \"Parasite\" functions as sort of a whacky, slightly over-the-top dark comedy and edgy social commentary about the absurd and drastic differences between the rich and poor. It's a funny, scathing, and often punchy look at the effects of an unfair and unbalanced economy that's felt the world over, and even though the Kims act immorally in the way they get the Park's current employees fired and exploit the family's trust and possessions, they're essentially likable and relatable people and we understand their motivations. They simply want to feel comfortable and worthy, and we can hardly blame them for that.\n\nJoon-ho initially seems intent on telling an amusing, almost slapstick story, especially when the Kims have to act quickly when Mrs. Park calls Chung-sook from her car and instructs Chung-sook to start boiling water for udon, because the Parks have decided to cut their camping weekend short and they'll be home in eight minutes! Suddenly, the Kim's weekend of decadence and lazing about becomes a mad dash to save their jobs and protect their true identities. \n\nYou might expect the film to become more screwball at this point, but instead of staying a flippant course, Joon-ho and Han Jin-won's ambitious screenplay takes an unexpected turn. The film remains punchy, but it now packs a different kind of punch, and what was a medium-hearted, sometimes vulgar comedy has suddenly become a violent, disturbing dramatic thriller, one that's sad, downbeat, cynical and eventually tragic.\n\nIt's hard to go into detail without spoiling the film's many shocks and surprising developments, but what I can tell you is that no matter what filmic persona \"Parasite\" assumes, it keeps viewers in its grasp and glued to the screen, no matter how preposterous it may seem. If the first half made us laugh and perhaps even hope for these down-on-their-luck characters, the second makes us think, sympathize and either cover our eyes or rub our heads in despair.\n\nI'm tempted to tell you more, but I really should leave it at that. Just know the film reveals a hidden layer, both figuratively and literally, when it introduces a new character with a heartrending yet perfectly credible history, and the story works to remind us, all the way up to its horrific and chaotic climax, that at the end of the day, it's in our nature to protect our families first, no matter the cost to others or ourselves.\n\nIf this has got you curious about where \"Parasite\" goes, that's the point, and I would advise you to go into it as cold as possible and simply allow it to enwrap you. Perhaps then you'll see why the film has garnered so much praise and attention since its release, not least winning the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. \n\nWhile I agree \"Parasite\" is certainly worthy of its acclaim, I think it's important to remember it's not just the film's provocative final act and somber ending that lend it its value, even though it will likely be these elements that leave the greatest impression on viewers. As powerful and effective as they are, I found its simple observations of its characters' everyday behaviors, as well as the juxtaposition of a rich and poor lifestyle, even more engaging, because it's these grounded, less theatrical aspects that inspire us to reflect on our own humanity and realize it's our quotidian, mundane actions that define who we are, for they are our means of survival. Long before its story turns dark, gruesome and emotionally charged, \"Parasite\" reiterated in me that not everyone has the same opportunities and resources, and therefore we must be mindful, compassionate and respectful of others as we go about our dull, daily routines because they can be drastically different for everyone, right down to finding food and shelter.\n\nIt shouldn't take violence and high emotions for us to see how imbalanced the world has become. As we persevere through an increasingly cynical and divisive world climate\u2014politically, economically, socially\u2014the lighter and more jocular first half of a film like \"Parasite\" should be enough to stir and impact us.

The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.\n\nHowever, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!\n\nAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.\n\nThis film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!", "score": 5}, {"date": "Oct 19, 2019", "text": "\"You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.\"\n\n'Parasite' is absolutely fantastic. I'm still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.\n\nI admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', but in my personal opinion those don't match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn't a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and 'Parasite' proves it.\n\nThe movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.\n\nThe performances from everyone was brilliant and there's so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it's the reason why I was engaged throughout.\n\nI highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.\n\nOverall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air.

The contrivances are piled on at such a rate towards the end I literally couldn't believe it. The film and its climaxes kept going on and on, feeling like almost three hours.

One action remains eating at my brain because it made no sense whatsoever.

Everything runs smoothly until one of the displaced servants shows up unexpectedly when the Kim family is away on a camping trip. The movie is fantastic; the performances by all are great, but what most stands out for me are the screenplay and the staging of the scenes. The screenplay is sharply written; the dialog is tight, incredibly funny, and dark at the same time. One of the things I liked about Snowpiercer, his previous film, is its take on class and class difference; the director elevates this to a new high in this film, where the differences become more and more apparent as the film progresses. The scenes are shot in a way that accentuates the disparateness of the two worlds reflected by the families. I cannot recall a film where I was so aware, in nearly every scene, the magnitude of the differences in how the rich and the poor live and experience life. The film is full of surprises; you are carried along with one expectation, then the next scene does something that jerks you into a different emotional reality. When the former servant arrives, you are yanked from what starts off as a hilarious social satire into a whole different world that is oddly funny, much, much darker, and yet even sharper in its message about class differences.

The filmmaker has never settled down in any genre and often goes for broke when it comes to embracing whatever genre he is dabbling in and then subverting, accelerating, and broadening that territory to show an audience what a master can do with these storytelling parameters. No movie under Bong Joon-ho's guidance is ever limited by its genre. Needless to say, I've been highly anticipating Parasite, even more so since the critics started bandying about terms like \"masterpiece.\" Simply put, Parasite is a miraculous movie.\n\nWe follow the Kim family who live in a scummy basement apartment on a filthy street known for public urination. They scam free wi-fi off their neighbor and badly fold pizza boxes for little money. They're barely hanging by on the outer edges of society when opportunity comes knocking. A rich family, the Parks, is in need of a new English tutor for their teenage daughter, and Ki-woo Kim (Choi Woo-sik) has the connection. He will pose as a college-educated English teacher, recommended from his friend, the departing tutor. He gets the job and sees further opportunity, eventually scheming to get each member of his family hired; sister Ki-jung Kim (Park So-dam) as an art therapist for the Park's troubled son, father Ki-taek Kim (Song Kang-ho) as the personal driver to the family, and mother Shung-sook Kim (Jang Hye-jin) as the housekeeper and personal assistant for the family. The Kim family gains further leverage as they worm their way inside this house, but there are secrets that will force them to readjust how far they are willing to go to service this bourgeois family and keep their good lies rolling.\n\nParasite just unfurls with such natural ease, building and developing outward, building its characters, their problems and deceptions, and then, like that, it effortlessly turns gears toward another tone, and you weren't even aware it was happening until after the fact. Bong Joon-ho's film is so exact and impeccable and calculated that the pieces are move in tandem like a well-oiled machine. The synchronicity is so amazing that I often had to acknowledge how effectively the movie had surprised or satisfied me. There isn't a wasted moment in the 130 minutes here, which begins as a fun con game between one family of shady grifters working their way inside a rich family's trust. From there, the movie gets even darker, more mysterious, outlandish, and even more mournful and delightful. There are moments of slapstick comedy that had me howling, divine sequences of tension that felt ready to explode, and regular emotional punches to the system that reminded you that despite everything these are still people capable of great suffering and great feeling. Parasite is a rare movie that works on near every level, each facet of filmmaking operating at such precision that it blends together to create a masterwork of tone and tenor that is universally accessible, brimming with menace and glee.\n\nThere's a simple pleasure to be had watching a con artist at play, so there's even more amusement when we're watching a family of con artists all spinning lies in tandem. The process of escalation is so clean and believable in the world's universe, with the first family member using their position of influence to manipulative the family into hiring the next family member, even if that means scheming to get rid of the Park family servant already occupying that desired position. The Park family matriarch is all about personal recommendations and using a tight circle of trust; however, the Kim family exploits the obvious loophole of what if the initial link in that chain is untrustworthy him or herself? Initially I thought the movie was going to be watching this one family worm their way into the lives of the rich and powerful and take over, and while that is true to a certain extent, the movie is thankfully even more than that. Still, the con aspect alone is highly entertaining and so naturally plotted, with each new addition feeling organic from the last. There are natural complications that provide new challenges for the family of con artists to maintain their shifting covers and having to think on their feet, and there isn't a moment relating to these antics where Parasite is not completely compelling and darkly funny even as it veers into extremes.\n\nIf you're thinking that the Kim family is the obvious target of the movie's parasitic titular allusion, slow down, my friend. While the Kim family is more obvious about their deceptions, the Park family too is filled with the deception of civility, kindness, and graciousness. At first, we laugh at them because of a general naivete that allows the Kims to flourish. As the Kims successfully roust different servants, they are routinely dismissed without much thought. Some of these people have been with the family for years and otherwise have spotless records, but all it takes is one whiff of impropriety and the Parks are already scrambling to cut them loose, usually very unceremoniously and immediately, with the misplaced idea that this will somehow be the \"nice\" and \"respectful\" way of handling a dismissal. They're so quick to turn on people they feel are disloyal or incompetent, but really, it's the disloyal aspect, that they can be manipulated so easily by the Kim family's suggestions and assertions. Never once do Mr. and Mrs. Park ask for their servants' side of the story; they accept the accusations with minimal evidence are gung-ho about removing their formally trusted help as if they have been waiting for these moments.\n\nThe movie becomes a parable of exploitation and the consequences of avarice, and I'm going to do my best to dance around some significant spoilers that reshape the film in its second half. At one point the Kims have all made themselves at home in the luxury of the Park estate while the family is away on a camping trip. It's carefree wish fulfillment, lapping in the excess, and then over a drunken family dinner, Mrs. Kim says that if she had this kind of money that she would be as nice as Mrs. Park (appears). For her, money is like an iron and irons out all the problems of life, and as a family that has constantly been hustling for their next dollar, to be free of cares and worries would be the ultimate luxury. However, there is naturally more to this estate and the Park family, and the movie takes some dark turns into a battle over status and how far people will go to protect what they feel belongs to them. This is acted out in very personal ways and also in larger metaphorical waves, which adds to the overall class warfare satire. What starts off as a spiky little con comedy becomes something deeper and more challenging, expanding its targets to indict everyone jockeying for position in a system that seems corrupted to a fault.\n\nEven as the Kim family is scheming and conniving, there are still moments that remind you that they aren't these smooth, amoral con men of the movies and are real human beings with real feelings and real insecurities. There's one moment Mr. Kim overhears his boss casually talking about him, and it's very complimentary except for one admission. Apparently, Mr. Kim has an odor to him that the rich man finds to be rather unpleasant (he describes it like an old radish). No matter the suits he puts on, no matter the politeness and charm he manifests, no matter his skills when it comes to being a dutiful driver, no matter the gaps that Mr. Kim feels he is surpassing, there will always be something innate to him that stops him from being accepted and integrated in this cherished, cordoned-off land of the rich. His very smell is offensive to the noses of the rich, and this is something so personal, so nasty, that it genuinely wounds the man and we feel for him. Bong Joon-ho asks his audience to embrace all sorts of uncomfortable positions, taking characters you found despicable and asking to see them as real human beings capable of great loss and shame. It stops the movie from feeling like it's treading into cartoon territory even as its violence and physical comedy ramps up in the second half. It never loses a sense of its soul.\n\nKi-woo Kim asks his father, after several setbacks, what their plan is next, how they will persevere against the latest setback. Mr. Kim answers that his trick is to never have a plan, because plans will inevitably fail. This is a nice character moment but also an insight into a perspective that leads to what I would argue is the emotional climax of the movie, where Ki-woo pledges to save someone through an elaborate and years-in-the-making plan. In that moment, is he rejecting his father's philosophy and driving forward on what will be at minimum years of hard work to reach his goal, which is motivated through reclamation and salvation rather than personal gain? Or is the very fact that he is committing such an elaborate plan an act of folly he knows will never materialize because that is the nature of plans? I love that the film leaves you, the viewer, to determine whether this assertion is optimistic or pessimistic and how that paints the film's message.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the movie is another showcase of how Bong Joon-ho is brilliant at visually communicating his wonderful stories. The editing is so tightly precise to maximize tension and comedy, and sometimes both simultaneously. The photography is gorgeously composed with the use of space in the frame excellently communicating character relationships. The geography of the home is nicely utilized to ratchet up the tension of escaping around corners and hiding around furniture. There are moments that just made me want to applaud the filmmakers for their top-level craft.\n\nParasite is an effortlessly impressive movie that blends tones, insights, and entertainment to create one of the more unique and pleasing film experiences of the year. Bong Joon-ho once again shown himself to be a masterclass filmmaker who can tackle just about any subject and any genre and make it sing. I'd advise to avoid specific spoilers to maintain the surprise factor; however, this movie is so well executed, so astonishingly developed with precision and attention given to each of the characters and their individual whims and problems, that even knowing every single plot beat in this movie will not diminish the enjoyment factor. That's because Parasite is a rare movie that is so sumptuously put together, so seamlessly calibrated, that to watch the movie is to simply sit in awe of how talented the filmmakers are at weaving their tale.

", "score": 5}, {"date": "Oct 11, 2019", "text": "I usually like to make sure the films I give this rating to are at least a year old. Since I'm confident enough that this one will stay this high though, I'm going to leave it like this. Like Burning, another recent South Korean film which I love, this one is best to go into without knowing much about the plot, so I'm not going to say too much about it. What I will say though is that it's a multi-layered, fascinating film which took the themes of another one of Joon-ho Bong's films which I consider to be great and actually managed to perfect them to something far more shocking and enthralling as multiple developments of them are daring to the point that the film constantly runs the risk of falling apart, yet thanks to Bong's direction, everything is held together quite flawlessly and, as a result, the entire film makes for a truly breathtaking feat. With that out of the way, I'll also add that the comedy is well-written and funny, yet it never manages to undermine the more serious elements to the film, the cinematography/framing is quite good, the final act is outstanding, and the final minute or so is truly sublime. Make sure to keep an eye out for this one.", "score": 4.5}, {"date": "Oct 11, 2019", "text": "Parasite is a meticulously crafted and superbly staged film from the Korean master Bong Joon Ho. It is clever, enlightening, funny and always captivating. A film that is tightly directed and written so that nothing ever feels remotely out of place. Set in Korea, it tells the tale of two families from opposite ends of the income scale. The poor family lives in a semi basement packing pizza boxes to make ends meet. The rich family live in a beautiful architect designed home with all the mod cons you could ask for. When their daughter needs a tutor a fortuitous break sees the son of the poorer family claim the job. Soon the family is plotting a scheme to have all four members find their way into employment in the richer household. This film is beautifully crafted, each scene is a gateway to the next. It's darkly funny but also dramatically rich. The third act gives many twists and turns that will keep you guessing through out. The film also makes some keen social commentary on the disparity between rich and poor. Just another layer to what is already a multi layered and successful film.", "score": 4}, {"date": "Oct 11, 2019", "text": "The first three quarters of the movie is cinematic perfection with an intriguing plot and extremely entertaining and unexpected plot twists.
