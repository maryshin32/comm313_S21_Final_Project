    "# Analysis of Critic Reviews from Nexis Uni\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello! In this data analysis notebook, I am going to explore and analyze the critic reviews that I downloaded, cleaned, and organized from Nexis Uni. \n",
    "\n",
    "Background info: I was originally planning on web scraping the critic reviews from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) and [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/), however, when I tried doing this, many of the links to the full critic reviews were either blocked with a paywall or the pages did not exist anymore. Therefore, I made the conscious decision to retrieve my critic reviews from [Nexis Uni](nexisuni.com.proxy.library.upenn.edu), which is an easy-to-use academic search engine that delivers relevant content to make scholarly research more efficient, through my UPenn student account. For the specific search queries and the steps I took on how to collect this data for both movies, please refer to the following 2 notebooks: `nexis_host_critic` and `nexis_parasite_critic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook here will be split into 2 parts, the first part for sentiment analysis and the second part for word and n-gram frequency list analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "With each part, the analysis will be carried out for critic reviews of _The Host_ and of _Parasite_ , and hopefully I can gain some insight into whether reviews of _Parasite_ generally express higher sentiment scores than those of _The Host_ . My end goal is also to compare the sentiment scores among critic reviews and user reviews. It will be intriguing to see whether there is a difference between the two groups. \n",

    "Let's get started!"

       "[{'text': 'Mar. 8, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- \\n If there.s one film that will plant South Korean cinema into the mind of the American public, The Host is it. Bong Joon-ho.s lively feature provides all the thrills and sensation of the average American summer spectacle, except that it does so while still remaining a good movie. It.s got heart, hilarity, triumph and tragedy as it gives us a fractured family that finally sets aside their differences and unites towards a common goal. It.s also got a giant mutant fish-monster that tries to eat everything in its path.\\n\\nStill with me? That.s the kind of film that The Host is - able to shift tones on a moment.s notice (often within the same scene), Bong uses all his formidable talents to bring respect to a disreputable genre. And thanks to his sure hand, somehow it all comes together.\\n\\nThe genesis of this giant mutant fish-monster comes in the year 2000 prologue, when an American government official, over the objections of his Korean subordinate, orders the disposal of several hundred bottles of formaldehyde (they were dusty). Flash forward to the present, when the monster crawls out of the Han River one fine summer day and wreaks a whole ton of havoc. \\n This is a spellbinding sequence - the first glimmer of the rampage comes when layabout snack-booth merchant Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) casually turns to his left and sees the beast running full bore at him, trampling or swallowing everyone in between, and the rest of the sequence has that same disbelieving, half-glimpsed quality about it. Most effective is the first tail whip, which would be played as a major shock-cut in Hollywood but here is viewed from a distance, which makes it somehow both more horrifying and weirdly funny. \\n\\nThe attack is all the more impressive for coming not fifteen minutes into a two-hour film; in lieu of arduous story setup, Bong quickly introduces the members of the Park family and jumps straight into the action, leaving the rest to be filled in on the fly as the remainder of the film proceeds. A significant portion of the family is elsewhere at the time -- Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) is on television attempting to win a gold medal in archery, while Nam-il (Park Hae-il) we learn of only in Gang-du.s conversation with his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung) about his showing up at parent-teacher day in place of the shiftless, borderline-narcoleptic Gang-du. \\n Among other things, Bong demonstrates with The Host that he.s adept at the art of storytelling shorthand. In this early scene alone, he gives us quick sketches of five characters without feeling expository or leaving the snack shack run by Gang-du.s father Hie-bong (Byoen Hie-bong), while simultaneously emphasizing the spatial separateness that is reflected by the family.s emotional divisions. Both of these gulfs are closed in short order by a horrific event, and that.s when the meat of The Host arrives on the scene.\\n\\nIt.s a hell of an event, too: During the opening monster mash, Gang-du loses sight of where he.s going, stumbles and accidentally lets go of Hyun-seo.s hand. Just as he realizes his error, he turns to see Hyun-seo being swept up and carried away by the monster.s tail. \\n Initially thinking her dead, the family is crushed. One night, though, Gang-du gets a call; the reception is full of static and the voice on the other end is difficult to hear, but it.s definitely Hyun-seo. Before her cell phone dies, she manages to get across that she.s alive in a sewer somewhere. The family then resolves to band together and save her... but first, they have to get out of quarantine. See, Gang-du got monster blood on him, and the monster might be carrying a new virus, so...\\n\\nAs you can see, there.s a lot going on in The Host. I haven.t even touched upon the political dimensions present within the progression of the plot -- it was, after all, the order of an American soldier that caused the mutation in the first place, and as the crisis spins out further, there.s talk of direct intervention. Bong isn.t just indulging in America-bashing, though; the Korean government is consistently displayed as corrupt, inefficient, and incompetent (example: the scene where Gang-du and Hie-bong talk their way through a guard post using quick words, a stolen van, and a bucketful of change). The further along things go, the less willing anyone in charge is to admit mistakes, which leads to some unforeseen narrative complications. By the climactic showdown, the Park family appears to be the only hope for humanity - where the institutions fail, the family will persevere.\\n\\nLest I lose sight of my target, though, I might as well confess that this is all thematic gravy and the foremost intent of The Host is to entertain. Bong succeeds in this aim grandly. He throws so many balls in the air that it seems inevitable that some will fall, and while a couple subplots go unresolved, on the whole Bong keeps an admirable balance. \\n He.s also not afraid to puncture the creeping seriousness of the situation with absurd comedy, such as the mourning scene degenerating into a thrashing slugfest between Nam-il and Gang-du or the hazmat-suited soldier who, in the middle of Hie-bong.s vow of vengeance against the beast that assumedly killed his granddaughter and apropos of nothing, slips and falls.\\n\\nThe action scenes are also well-handled. While nothing quite tops the jaw-dropping frisson of the monster.s introductory romp, Bong moves the film along at a crisp pace and keeps the tension at a rolling boil. Whether it.s Nam-il giving an impromptu demonstration of his escape artist skills, Nam-joo attempting to get off an arrow at the monster before it runs her over, or Hyen-seo struggling to sneak out of the monster.s lair without attracting attention, The Host keeps the excitement coming.\\n\\nIt.s the finale, with its confrontation between an exhausted monster and a determined Park family, that drives home the true measure of Bong.s achievement. The mutant fish is a means, not an end. While it.s lots of fun to watch a big ugly something chow down, there needs to be something else down the line if a work of art is going to be more than a forgettable diversion. By not losing sight of the humanity of the situation, The Host succeeds in ways most genre efforts wouldn.t think to consider. \\nSteve Carlson has been running his website The Ongoing Cinematic Education of... for over five years. He likes caffeine. And alcohol.\\n\\u2028Notes\\n\\n\\n\\nThe views expressed on blogs distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (\"Blogs via Newstex\") are solely the author\\'s and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

       " {'text': 'Mar. 9, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- \\n A nifty little monster movie with post-modernist touches that both add and detract from its effectiveness, writer-director Bong Joon-ho\\'s The Host gets right to the good stuff. After a quick introduction to Gang-du, who works at his family\\'s food stand (sort of a mini 7-Eleven), and his spunky young daughter Hyun-seo, the movie shifts immediately to a strange sight nearby, drawing a crowd to the bank of Seoul\\'s Han River: something is hanging off a bridge right in the middle of its span. \\n Suddenly, it drops into the water, swimming, and the excited crowd watches its approach. They start to throw food -- and cans of beer -- at the shape in the river. But when that shadow comes to the surface, the playful tone shifts, and the film quickly gets scary as hell: the shape is not the least bit friendly, and it immediately starts chasing, and eating, humans.\\n\\nThe Korean title translates as Creature, and indeed the creature is the single most accomplished thing in the movie: a co-creation of two special effects houses, The Orphanage (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Superman Returns) and Weta Workshop (The Lord of the Rings). This very frightening beast is part giant cockroach, part carnivorous tadpole, with the terrifying multiple fanged mouths of Alien\\'s alien, plus a really long tongue. Whenever It is on screen, or even threatening to appear, this is a splendidly effective scare picture.\\n\\nBut Bong Joon-ho has other things on his mind. The store-owning family members are a vivid group of eccentrics, and they become outlaws on the run after one of them is snatched by the creature and the authorities refuse to help them rescue her. The family escapes from the quarantine that has been imposed, and ventures out to find the monster\\'s lair. The American title, The Host, is ironic: the behavior of the police and the national health officials is handled with sometimes bitter satire, as they come to the conclusion that the creature has introduced a deadly new virus into the world. The authorities (and a mob of conformists following their orders) become co-villains in the story -- but they act out of blind stupidity, while the creature itself is only doing what comes naturally.\\n\\nIn its mix of superb film craft with sophomoric jokes, slapstick, shocking violence and sometimes satirical social commentary, The Host reminds me of another recent movie from Korea, Park Chan-wook\\'s Lady Vengeance. The disparate elements don\\'t always gel, and American genre fans expecting an ordinary sort of action picture are likely to be unhappy with some of the odd, and sad, plot twists -- but after seeing either The Host or Lady Vengeance, you know you\\'re in the presence of a major talent. (Both of these movies played at the New York Film Festival, and roused crowds accustomed to rather more sedate fare. Bong\\'s earlier film, Memories of Murder, available on DVD, is also a genre picture with downbeat twists, and it has some interesting similarities to, and differences from, the new film Zodiac.)\\n\\nThe photography and editing of The Host are top-notch. The Han River location is vividly evoked, and the chases that take place near -- and beneath -- the river bank are breathtakingly well done. The Park family\\'s journey isn\\'t very long geographically, but it takes on the nature of a heroic quest, even though as heroes they have their ups and downs. Gang-du\\'s sister Nam-joo (played by Bae Doo-na) is a champion archer (well, a bronze medalist) whose Achilles heel is being a little too&hellip; slow to let the arrow fly -- and this becomes a witty visual joke at various points in the movie. Their brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il) seems at first a worthless, belligerent young drunk, but he proves his worth as the adventure continues. Gang-du himself is a bit of a goofy, shiftless layabout, but as events give his life a grim purpose, actor Song Kang-ho skillfully transforms the character into a real hero of sorts. (Actors Park and Song were also in Memories of Murder.)\\n\\nThe plot is sometimes sketchy, unc onvincing, even silly, as is the satirical way the army and health officials are portrayed. But the movie has enough energy to ride over these faults. When the family\\'s quest takes a tragic turn, however, it feels like a miscalculation -- the tone has been mostly fast and smartass up to that point, and one may not know how to react to the jarring shift. This may be just what director Bong has in mind, however, being a bit of an absurdist, gleefully mixing the comic and the sad.\\n\\nSo you may or may not feel completely satisfied by the story itself. But if you\\'re a monster movie aficionado, this is a monster you won\\'t want to miss. And if you\\'re interested in the Asian movies that have been expanding and subverting genres, such as Lady Vengeance and Infernal Affairs (the Hong Kong film on which The Departed is based), Bong Joon-ho is a director to watch -- and The Host is a good place to start. \\nHandyguy (aka Randall Byrn) is a marketing director at a business magazine\\'s conference division in New York. A transplanted Southerner, he has been a movie buff since birth. He\\'s always secretly wanted to be Pauline Kael, and blogcritics gives him an approximation of that, or so he likes to fantasize at least. Handy has a film degree from USC.\\n\\u2028Notes\\n\\n\\n\\nThe views expressed on blogs distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (\"Blogs via Newstex\") are solely the author\\'s and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

       " {'text': 'Apr. 27--Science gone wrong!\\nA military mobilized!\\nAn (Asian) nation terrified!\\nA creature who would not die!\\nWith 1,000 teeth! 10,000 eyes!\\nFrom the ocean floor!\\nSigh.\\nAs a moviegoer who grew up on Boston\\'s Creature Double Feature (back-to-back marauding-giant-monster movies, every Saturday afternoon on a scratchy UHF channel), as a rational adult who pays taxes and buys milk, as a journalist who goes to movies for a living, I must say, it is one of the disappointments of my professional life that big green slimy beasts, with legs as thick as redwoods and claws that tear up pavement, climbing from a toxic river to lay waste to a feckless mankind, are far too rare.\\nI see 17 talking animal cartoons a year. I watch 34 odd serial killer pictures, and catch a baker\\'s dozen of war movies and my share of films about horny teenagers. I sit though 73 films every 12 months with Judi Dench and/or Jude Law -- but the descendants of Godzilla have remained, oddly, trapped in the primordial ooze from whence they came.\\nLaugh, snicker -- put The Queen at the top of your Netflix queue for all I care!\\nA puckish new South Korean export, The Host, which opens in Toledo today, makes a convincing, and playfully deranged, argument that the giant-monster genre is far more malleable than we imagined.\\nYes, it\\'s a monster movie, first and foremost, sure. But oh, it argues, your typical Asian monster mash can be a dysfunctional family drama, or a political satire, a cautionary environmental warning, or a straight-out comedy, a governmental farce about ineffectual bureaucrats, or a metaphor for the American military presence in South Korea, or a reminder of the ingenuity of children -- and so on.\\nDirector Bong Joon-ho, who indeed grew up not far from a U.S. military base, picks all of the above. As messy as the overall shebang may be -- here is a picture in a constant pitched battle over what mood or point it wants to convey -- it\\'s not overstating to say it handles every last one of those far-flung goals, individually, with equal wit and grace. In fact, that shaggy, loose-limbed quality is what makes it more than a monster movie. It\\'s got charm to spare. Since its premiere last year in South Korea, The Host has become the biggest smash in that country\\'s history, a literal Bong hit; and when I saw it last October at the New York Film Festival (I\\'ve since seen it two more times), the crush of highbrow cinema snobs pushing to get into a midnight screening threatened to become a black-rectangular-eyeglass-frame battle royale.\\nStill not convinced?\\nTwo images stick.\\nThe first is the initial, lyrical sighting of the monster -which is something else, let me tell you. We are witness to a Day Everything Changed, though it starts out a Day Like Any Other. Families picnic and dogs bark and the sun shines along the Han River, a wide strip of water that cuts through downtown Seoul. A line forms at the family-run snack van, until someone shouts, \"Hey, what\\'s that?\" And someone else shouts, \"It\\'s moving,\" and now everyone in the park is standing and pointing and gasping, and the tension ratchets up with each passing second: Hanging from the steel beams of a huge bridge that spans the Han, maybe a hundred yards away, is a long dollop of ... something ugly, a large fluttering tonsil of sorts.\\nIt unfurls its body, back-flips cleanly from girder to girder, and jackknifes into the water with barely a splash. The crowds ahhs. A few snap photos with their cell phones. The creature glides just under the water\\'s surface, along the bank. Nobody breathes. Then someone hits it with a beer can. Great. It leaps from the Han. It\\'s full-grown and irate. It resembles a large tadpole with legs, like the result of sex between a rhinoceros and a school bus.\\nThe other image comes in the end -- actually, it\\'s the last shot (but it gives nothing away). The family who runs that snack van is sharing a meal. They\\'ve been through a lot. Summer\\'s gone and winter\\'s arrived. The camera pulls back until their tiny home is now a tiny island, the warm yellow glow of the light in the window, a swirl of snow gusting across the ground, and nobody else in sight.\\nGodzilla never had ennui.\\nBut then The Host is the last thing you expect: a monster movie with a soul, a creature feature that uses the creature to get at something unexpected -- a snapshot of generations struggling to pull together. It starts with a familiar B-movie set-up, though, one with pointed political purpose: An American scientist orders his Korean assistant to pour 200 gallons of formaldehyde down the drain. The underling protests. But the scientist cuts him off: \"I am not used to repeating myself!\" Ah, the folly of man!\\nWill they never stop meddling with nature!?!\\nCut to six years later, and we meet the Park family. Grandpa is a timid provider, weak in the knees, quick to bow to anyone in a uniform. His children are adult failures: There\\'s the college graduate who can\\'t get a job and dreams of his Molotov cocktail pro-democracy riot days (he may get a chance to re-live those); there\\'s the professional archer (always handy in a monster movie) who always chokes, and there\\'s the oldest, with a bad dye job, forever falling asleep when you need him. No one gets along. The one family member who isn\\'t a mess is the grandchild, Hyun-seo (play by an exquisite young actress named Ah Sung Ko). But when monster meets matriarch, to the grief of the family, Hyun-seo is captured. The Parks mount a rescue attempt. Or rather, they try.\\nFrom here, like many a South Korean film, The Host spreads out in as many directions as that monster\\'s jaw -- which unfolds like a malevolent flower. But the emotions are real and the focus is squarely on the characters. The film sags in its midsection, but that\\'s out of ambition and willingness to chase an idea. The government overreacts and falls back into old authoritarian habits. Unlike old monster movies, in the new ones, like this one, the authorities are not your first choice when disaster strikes. The Parks wind up facing a bureaucracy as brutal as the beast. The military scapegoats. The visiting authorities (that\\'s us, the U.S.) stonewall. If Godzilla was born of a nuclear blast, here is a monster born of new anxieties, and of course, we get the scary creature we deserve.\\nContact Christopher Borrelli at: cborrelli@theblade.com or 419-724-6117.\\nCopyright (c) 2007, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News.

One night, though, Gang-du gets a call; the reception is full of static and the voice on the other end is difficult to hear, but it.s definitely Hyun-seo. Before her cell phone dies, she manages to get across that she.s alive in a sewer somewhere. The family then resolves to band together and save her... but first, they have to get out of quarantine. See, Gang-du got monster blood on him, and the monster might be carrying a new virus, so...\\n\\nAs you can see, there.s a lot going on in The Host. I haven.t even touched upon the political dimensions present within the progression of the plot -- it was, after all, the order of an American soldier that caused the mutation in the first place, and as the crisis spins out further, there.s talk of direct intervention. Bong isn.t just indulging in America-bashing, though; the Korean government is consistently displayed as corrupt, inefficient, and incompetent (example: the scene where Gang-du and Hie-bong talk their way through a guard post using quick words, a stolen van, and a bucketful of change). The further along things go, the less willing anyone in charge is to admit mistakes, which leads to some unforeseen narrative complications. By the climactic showdown, the Park family appears to be the only hope for humanity - where the institutions fail, the family will persevere.\\n\\nLest I lose sight of my target, though, I might as well confess that this is all thematic gravy and the foremost intent of The Host is to entertain. Bong succeeds in this aim grandly. He throws so many balls in the air that it seems inevitable that some will fall, and while a couple subplots go unresolved, on the whole Bong keeps an admirable balance. \\n He.s also not afraid to puncture the creeping seriousness of the situation with absurd comedy, such as the mourning scene degenerating into a thrashing slugfest between Nam-il and Gang-du or the hazmat-suited soldier who, in the middle of Hie-bong.s vow of vengeance against the beast that assumedly killed his granddaughter and apropos of nothing, slips and falls.\\n\\nThe action scenes are also well-handled. While nothing quite tops the jaw-dropping frisson of the monster.s introductory romp, Bong moves the film along at a crisp pace and keeps the tension at a rolling boil. Whether it.s Nam-il giving an impromptu demonstration of his escape artist skills, Nam-joo attempting to get off an arrow at the monster before it runs her over, or Hyen-seo struggling to sneak out of the monster.s lair without attracting attention, The Host keeps the excitement coming.\\n\\nIt.s the finale, with its confrontation between an exhausted monster and a determined Park family, that drives home the true measure of Bong.s achievement. The mutant fish is a means, not an end. While it.s lots of fun to watch a big ugly something chow down, there needs to be something else down the line if a work of art is going to be more than a forgettable diversion. By not losing sight of the humanity of the situation, The Host succeeds in ways most genre efforts wouldn.t think to consider. \\nSteve Carlson has been running his website The Ongoing Cinematic Education of... for over five years.

       " 'text': 'Mar. 8, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- \\n If there.s one film that will plant South Korean cinema into the mind of the American public, The Host is it. Bong Joon-ho.s lively feature provides all the thrills and sensation of the average American summer spectacle, except that it does so while still remaining a good movie. It.s got heart, hilarity, triumph and tragedy as it gives us a fractured family that finally sets aside their differences and unites towards a common goal. It.s also got a giant mutant fish-monster that tries to eat everything in its path.\\n\\nStill with me? That.s the kind of film that The Host is - able to shift tones on a moment.s notice (often within the same scene), Bong uses all his formidable talents to bring respect to a disreputable genre. And thanks to his sure hand, somehow it all comes together.\\n\\nThe genesis of this giant mutant fish-monster comes in the year 2000 prologue, when an American government official, over the objections of his Korean subordinate, orders the disposal of several hundred bottles of formaldehyde (they were dusty). Flash forward to the present, when the monster crawls out of the Han River one fine summer day and wreaks a whole ton of havoc. \\n This is a spellbinding sequence - the first glimmer of the rampage comes when layabout snack-booth merchant Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) casually turns to his left and sees the beast running full bore at him, trampling or swallowing everyone in between, and the rest of the sequence has that same disbelieving, half-glimpsed quality about it. Most effective is the first tail whip, which would be played as a major shock-cut in Hollywood but here is viewed from a distance, which makes it somehow both more horrifying and weirdly funny. \\n\\nThe attack is all the more impressive for coming not fifteen minutes into a two-hour film; in lieu of arduous story setup, Bong quickly introduces the members of the Park family and jumps straight into the action, leaving the rest to be filled in on the fly as the remainder of the film proceeds. A significant portion of the family is elsewhere at the time -- Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) is on television attempting to win a gold medal in archery, while Nam-il (Park Hae-il) we learn of only in Gang-du.s conversation with his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung) about his showing up at parent-teacher day in place of the shiftless, borderline-narcoleptic Gang-du. \\n Among other things, Bong demonstrates with The Host that he.s adept at the art of storytelling shorthand. In this early scene alone, he gives us quick sketches of five characters without feeling expository or leaving the snack shack run by Gang-du.s father Hie-bong (Byoen Hie-bong), while simultaneously emphasizing the spatial separateness that is reflected by the family.s emotional divisions. Both of these gulfs are closed in short order by a horrific event, and that.s when the meat of The Host arrives on the scene.\\n\\nIt.s a hell of an event, too: During the opening monster mash, Gang-du loses sight of where he.s going, stumbles and accidentally lets go of Hyun-seo.s hand. Just as he realizes his error, he turns to see Hyun-seo being swept up and carried away by the monster.s tail. \\n Initially thinking her dead, the family is crushed. One night, though, Gang-du gets a call; the reception is full of static and the voice on the other end is difficult to hear, but it.s definitely Hyun-seo. Before her cell phone dies, she manages to get across that she.s alive in a sewer somewhere. The family then resolves to band together and save her... but first, they have to get out of quarantine. See, Gang-du got monster blood on him, and the monster might be carrying a new virus, so...\\n\\nAs you can see, there.s a lot going on in The Host. I haven.t even touched upon the political dimensions present within the progression of the plot -- it was, after all, the order of an American soldier that caused the mutation in the first place, and as the crisis spins out further, there.s talk of direct intervention. Bong isn.t just indulging in America-bashing, though; the Korean government is consistently displayed as corrupt, inefficient, and incompetent (example: the scene where Gang-du and Hie-bong talk their way through a guard post using quick words, a stolen van, and a bucketful of change). The further along things go, the less willing anyone in charge is to admit mistakes, which leads to some unforeseen narrative complications. By the climactic showdown, the Park family appears to be the only hope for humanity - where the institutions fail, the family will persevere.\\n\\nLest I lose sight of my target, though, I might as well confess that this is all thematic gravy and the foremost intent of The Host is to entertain. Bong succeeds in this aim grandly. He throws so many balls in the air that it seems inevitable that some will fall, and while a couple subplots go unresolved, on the whole Bong keeps an admirable balance. \\n He.s also not afraid to puncture the creeping seriousness of the situation with absurd comedy, such as the mourning scene degenerating into a thrashing slugfest between Nam-il and Gang-du or the hazmat-suited soldier who, in the middle of Hie-bong.s vow of vengeance against the beast that assumedly killed his granddaughter and apropos of nothing, slips and falls.\\n\\nThe action scenes are also well-handled. While nothing quite tops the jaw-dropping frisson of the monster.s introductory romp, Bong moves the film along at a crisp pace and keeps the tension at a rolling boil. Whether it.s Nam-il giving an impromptu demonstration of his escape artist skills, Nam-joo attempting to get off an arrow at the monster before it runs her over, or Hyen-seo struggling to sneak out of the monster.s lair without attracting attention, The Host keeps the excitement coming.\\n\\nIt.s the finale, with its confrontation between an exhausted monster and a determined Park family, that drives home the true measure of Bong.s achievement. The mutant fish is a means, not an end. While it.s lots of fun to watch a big ugly something chow down, there needs to be something else down the line if a work of art is going to be more than a forgettable diversion. By not losing sight of the humanity of the situation, The Host succeeds in ways most genre efforts wouldn.t think to consider. \\nSteve Carlson has been running his website The Ongoing Cinematic Education of... for over five years.

       "{'text': \"Jan 27, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite[1] is taking Hollywood by storm[2] this award season. In fact, the South Korean release is gearing up as a Best Picture frontrunner[3] heading into Oscars 2020. Director Bong Joon-ho's latest film defies genre to tell a complex story about two interconnected families and, by extension, delivers some crucial social commentary[4].With Parasite#8216;s success, we're sure moviegoers will be interested to see some of Bong's previous work. Prior to his Oscar-nominated hit[5], the director had made six films. Here's a quick breakdown of the features he has directed throughout his career. \\n Bong Joon-ho and the cast of #8216;Parasite' at the Screen ActorsGuild Awards | John Sciulli/Getty Images for Turner#8216;Barking Dogs Never Bite' (2000)Barking Dogs Never Bite (Trailer)[6]In his 2000 directorial debut, Bong already aimed to combine genres in an innovative way. This dark comedy-drama follows an unemployed college professor (Lee Sung-jae) who begins abusing and kidnapping dogs the barking dogs in his apartment building. At the same time, a young woman (Bae Doona) takes note of his activities, launching an investigation into the surge of missing dogs. Despite its bizarre-sounding premise, Barking Dogs Never Bite gave Bong the chance to try his hand at directing a feature. Prior to this film, the [7]Parasite[8] filmmaker[9] had only directed three short films. However, he previously earned writing credits on 1997's Motel Cactus and 1999's Phantom: The Submarine. #8216;Memories of Murder' (2003)Memories of Murder (2003) - movie trailer[10]In his 2003 sophomore effort, Bong landed his first collaboration with Song Kang-ho. The actor delivers a critically acclaimed standout performance in [11]Parasite[12]. Song has sustained an ongoing collaboration with Bong over the course of both their careers.In Memories of Murder, the actor andKim Sang-kyung play two detectives trying to solve the real-life case of Korea's first serial murders. The investigation continued from 1986 to 1991, and the film — based on a 1996 play — earned strong reviews for its depiction and performances. #8216;The Host' (2006)The Host (2006) #8212; Trailer[13]Memories of Murder gained Bong international acclaim. But The Host solidified him as a commercially successful filmmaker. The film follows a man's (Song) effort to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped by a giant monster.At the time of its release, The Host became the highest-grossing South Korean movie of all time. Although mainstream success in the United States eluded Bong, this film was a critical step in establishing his reputation for offbeat, inventive genre projects.  #8216;Mother' (2009)Mother Official HD Trailer - From the Director of THE HOST[14]No, this one has nothing to do with either the 1996 Albert Brooks film or the 2017 Darren Aronofsky release[15]. Rather, this Mother follows a mother's (Kim Hye-ja) search for the killer responsible for framing her son (Won Bin) for murder.It might not have received as much attention stateside as some of Bong's other films. However, Mother was still a critical smash in South Korea and beloved by critics. As has become Bong's trademark, the movie expertly combines a number of genres, including family drama, horror, and comedy. #8216;Snowpiercer' (2013)Snowpiercer Official US Release Trailer #1 (2014) - Chris Evans Movie HD[16]Bong made his English-language directorial debut with this dystopian sci-fi thriller. Led by Chris Evans, the film features an all-star cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Ed Harris, and — of course — Song. It's also the most expensive Korean production in history.Snowpiercer is set aboard the titular train, which carries the last remnants of the human race. The film tackles key issues such as climate change but does so in a way that never fails to be thrilling. In fact, its success — much like that of [17]Parasite[18] — has inspired a new TV series[19]. #8216;Okja' (2017)Okja | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix[20]This Netflix film might be a lot of moviegoers' first exposure to Bong. Part of that comes from its accessibility on the streaming service. Yet, Okja — Bong's second consecutive English-language release[21] — is just as much in line with his distinctive sensibility as his other films.The movie centers on a genetically modified creature named Okja, its friendship with a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun), and her efforts to protect it. Okja also features an international cast which combines South Korean performers with stars like Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and Swinton.

       " 'text': \"Jan 27, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Parasite[1] is taking Hollywood by storm[2] this award season. In fact, the South Korean release is gearing up as a Best Picture frontrunner[3] heading into Oscars 2020. Director Bong Joon-ho's latest film defies genre to tell a complex story about two interconnected families and, by extension, delivers some crucial social commentary[4].With Parasite#8216;s success, we're sure moviegoers will be interested to see some of Bong's previous work. Prior to his Oscar-nominated hit[5], the director had made six films. Here's a quick breakdown of the features he has directed throughout his career. \\n Bong Joon-ho and the cast of #8216;Parasite' at the Screen ActorsGuild Awards | John Sciulli/Getty Images for Turner#8216;Barking Dogs Never Bite' (2000)Barking Dogs Never Bite (Trailer)[6]In his 2000 directorial debut, Bong already aimed to combine genres in an innovative way. This dark comedy-drama follows an unemployed college professor (Lee Sung-jae) who begins abusing and kidnapping dogs the barking dogs in his apartment building. At the same time, a young woman (Bae Doona) takes note of his activities, launching an investigation into the surge of missing dogs. Despite its bizarre-sounding premise, Barking Dogs Never Bite gave Bong the chance to try his hand at directing a feature. Prior to this film, the [7]Parasite[8] filmmaker[9] had only directed three short films. However, he previously earned writing credits on 1997's Motel Cactus and 1999's Phantom: The Submarine. #8216;Memories of Murder' (2003)Memories of Murder (2003) - movie trailer[10]In his 2003 sophomore effort, Bong landed his first collaboration with Song Kang-ho. The actor delivers a critically acclaimed standout performance in [11]Parasite[12]. Song has sustained an ongoing collaboration with Bong over the course of both their careers.In Memories of Murder, the actor andKim Sang-kyung play two detectives trying to solve the real-life case of Korea's first serial murders. The investigation continued from 1986 to 1991, and the film — based on a 1996 play — earned strong reviews for its depiction and performances. #8216;The Host' (2006)The Host (2006) #8212; Trailer[13]Memories of Murder gained Bong international acclaim. But The Host solidified him as a commercially successful filmmaker. The film follows a man's (Song) effort to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped by a giant monster.At the time of its release, The Host became the highest-grossing South Korean movie of all time. Although mainstream success in the United States eluded Bong, this film was a critical step in establishing his reputation for offbeat, inventive genre projects.  #8216;Mother' (2009)Mother Official HD Trailer - From the Director of THE HOST[14]No, this one has nothing to do with either the 1996 Albert Brooks film or the 2017 Darren Aronofsky release[15]. Rather, this Mother follows a mother's (Kim Hye-ja) search for the killer responsible for framing her son (Won Bin) for murder.It might not have received as much attention stateside as some of Bong's other films. However, Mother was still a critical smash in South Korea and beloved by critics. As has become Bong's trademark, the movie expertly combines a number of genres, including family drama, horror, and comedy. #8216;Snowpiercer' (2013)Snowpiercer Official US Release Trailer #1 (2014) - Chris Evans Movie HD[16]Bong made his English-language directorial debut with this dystopian sci-fi thriller. Led by Chris Evans, the film features an all-star cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Ed Harris, and — of course — Song. It's also the most expensive Korean production in history.Snowpiercer is set aboard the titular train, which carries the last remnants of the human race. The film tackles key issues such as climate change but does so in a way that never fails to be thrilling. In fact, its success — much like that of [17]Parasite[18] — has inspired a new TV series[19]. #8216;Okja' (2017)Okja | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix[20]This Netflix film might be a lot of moviegoers' first exposure to Bong. Part of that comes from its accessibility on the streaming service. Yet, Okja — Bong's second consecutive English-language release[21] — is just as much in line with his distinctive sensibility as his other films.The movie centers on a genetically modified creature named Okja, its friendship with a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun), and her efforts to protect it. Okja also features an international cast which combines South Korean performers with stars like Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and Swinton.

    "* We probably cannot make any extensive or significant observations due to the fact that there's a big discrepancy in the data sizes. However, this in and of itself is a noteworthy observation: there is a lot more \"buzz\" around _Parasite_ , hence there are hundreds of reviews written about this 2019 film across newspapers, blogs, magazines, and more. On the other hand, the fact that _The Host_ was not written about as much, tells us that there was arguably less attention devoted to this 2007 film by film critics. "

       "  'text': 'Mar. 8, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- \\n If there.s one film that will plant South Korean cinema into the mind of the American public, The Host is it. Bong Joon-ho.s lively feature provides all the thrills and sensation of the average American summer spectacle, except that it does so while still remaining a good movie. It.s got heart, hilarity, triumph and tragedy as it gives us a fractured family that finally sets aside their differences and unites towards a common goal. It.s also got a giant mutant fish-monster that tries to eat everything in its path.\\n\\nStill with me? That.s the kind of film that The Host is - able to shift tones on a moment.s notice (often within the same scene), Bong uses all his formidable talents to bring respect to a disreputable genre. And thanks to his sure hand, somehow it all comes together.\\n\\nThe genesis of this giant mutant fish-monster comes in the year 2000 prologue, when an American government official, over the objections of his Korean subordinate, orders the disposal of several hundred bottles of formaldehyde (they were dusty). Flash forward to the present, when the monster crawls out of the Han River one fine summer day and wreaks a whole ton of havoc. \\n This is a spellbinding sequence - the first glimmer of the rampage comes when layabout snack-booth merchant Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) casually turns to his left and sees the beast running full bore at him, trampling or swallowing everyone in between, and the rest of the sequence has that same disbelieving, half-glimpsed quality about it. Most effective is the first tail whip, which would be played as a major shock-cut in Hollywood but here is viewed from a distance, which makes it somehow both more horrifying and weirdly funny. \\n\\nThe attack is all the more impressive for coming not fifteen minutes into a two-hour film; in lieu of arduous story setup, Bong quickly introduces the members of the Park family and jumps straight into the action, leaving the rest to be filled in on the fly as the remainder of the film proceeds. A significant portion of the family is elsewhere at the time -- Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) is on television attempting to win a gold medal in archery, while Nam-il (Park Hae-il) we learn of only in Gang-du.s conversation with his daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung) about his showing up at parent-teacher day in place of the shiftless, borderline-narcoleptic Gang-du. \\n Among other things, Bong demonstrates with The Host that he.s adept at the art of storytelling shorthand. In this early scene alone, he gives us quick sketches of five characters without feeling expository or leaving the snack shack run by Gang-du.s father Hie-bong (Byoen Hie-bong), while simultaneously emphasizing the spatial separateness that is reflected by the family.s emotional divisions. Both of these gulfs are closed in short order by a horrific event, and that.s when the meat of The Host arrives on the scene.\\n\\nIt.s a hell of an event, too: During the opening monster mash, Gang-du loses sight of where he.s going, stumbles and accidentally lets go of Hyun-seo.s hand. Just as he realizes his error, he turns to see Hyun-seo being swept up and carried away by the monster.s tail. \\n Initially thinking her dead, the family is crushed. One night, though, Gang-du gets a call; the reception is full of static and the voice on the other end is difficult to hear, but it.s definitely Hyun-seo. Before her cell phone dies, she manages to get across that she.s alive in a sewer somewhere. The family then resolves to band together and save her... but first, they have to get out of quarantine. See, Gang-du got monster blood on him, and the monster might be carrying a new virus, so...\\n\\nAs you can see, there.s a lot going on in The Host. I haven.t even touched upon the political dimensions present within the progression of the plot -- it was, after all, the order of an American soldier that caused the mutation in the first place, and as the crisis spins out further, there.s talk of direct intervention. Bong isn.t just indulging in America-bashing, though; the Korean government is consistently displayed as corrupt, inefficient, and incompetent (example: the scene where Gang-du and Hie-bong talk their way through a guard post using quick words, a stolen van, and a bucketful of change). The further along things go, the less willing anyone in charge is to admit mistakes, which leads to some unforeseen narrative complications. By the climactic showdown, the Park family appears to be the only hope for humanity - where the institutions fail, the family will persevere.\\n\\nLest I lose sight of my target, though, I might as well confess that this is all thematic gravy and the foremost intent of The Host is to entertain. Bong succeeds in this aim grandly. He throws so many balls in the air that it seems inevitable that some will fall, and while a couple subplots go unresolved, on the whole Bong keeps an admirable balance. \\n He.s also not afraid to puncture the creeping seriousness of the situation with absurd comedy, such as the mourning scene degenerating into a thrashing slugfest between Nam-il and Gang-du or the hazmat-suited soldier who, in the middle of Hie-bong.s vow of vengeance against the beast that assumedly killed his granddaughter and apropos of nothing, slips and falls.\\n\\nThe action scenes are also well-handled. While nothing quite tops the jaw-dropping frisson of the monster.s introductory romp, Bong moves the film along at a crisp pace and keeps the tension at a rolling boil. Whether it.s Nam-il giving an impromptu demonstration of his escape artist skills, Nam-joo attempting to get off an arrow at the monster before it runs her over, or Hyen-seo struggling to sneak out of the monster.s lair without attracting attention, The Host keeps the excitement coming.\\n\\nIt.s the finale, with its confrontation between an exhausted monster and a determined Park family, that drives home the true measure of Bong.s achievement. The mutant fish is a means, not an end. While it.s lots of fun to watch a big ugly something chow down, there needs to be something else down the line if a work of art is going to be more than a forgettable diversion. By not losing sight of the humanity of the situation, The Host succeeds in ways most genre efforts wouldn.t think to consider. \\nSteve Carlson has been running his website The Ongoing Cinematic Education of... for over five years.

       "  'text': 'Mar. 9, 2007 (Blogcritics.org delivered by Newstex) -- \\n A nifty little monster movie with post-modernist touches that both add and detract from its effectiveness, writer-director Bong Joon-ho\\'s The Host gets right to the good stuff. After a quick introduction to Gang-du, who works at his family\\'s food stand (sort of a mini 7-Eleven), and his spunky young daughter Hyun-seo, the movie shifts immediately to a strange sight nearby, drawing a crowd to the bank of Seoul\\'s Han River: something is hanging off a bridge right in the middle of its span. \\n Suddenly, it drops into the water, swimming, and the excited crowd watches its approach. They start to throw food -- and cans of beer -- at the shape in the river. But when that shadow comes to the surface, the playful tone shifts, and the film quickly gets scary as hell: the shape is not the least bit friendly, and it immediately starts chasing, and eating, humans.\\n\\nThe Korean title translates as Creature, and indeed the creature is the single most accomplished thing in the movie: a co-creation of two special effects houses, The Orphanage (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Superman Returns) and Weta Workshop (The Lord of the Rings). This very frightening beast is part giant cockroach, part carnivorous tadpole, with the terrifying multiple fanged mouths of Alien\\'s alien, plus a really long tongue. Whenever It is on screen, or even threatening to appear, this is a splendidly effective scare picture.\\n\\nBut Bong Joon-ho has other things on his mind. The store-owning family members are a vivid group of eccentrics, and they become outlaws on the run after one of them is snatched by the creature and the authorities refuse to help them rescue her. The family escapes from the quarantine that has been imposed, and ventures out to find the monster\\'s lair. The American title, The Host, is ironic: the behavior of the police and the national health officials is handled with sometimes bitter satire, as they come to the conclusion that the creature has introduced a deadly new virus into the world. The authorities (and a mob of conformists following their orders) become co-villains in the story -- but they act out of blind stupidity, while the creature itself is only doing what comes naturally.\\n\\nIn its mix of superb film craft with sophomoric jokes, slapstick, shocking violence and sometimes satirical social commentary, The Host reminds me of another recent movie from Korea, Park Chan-wook\\'s Lady Vengeance. The disparate elements don\\'t always gel, and American genre fans expecting an ordinary sort of action picture are likely to be unhappy with some of the odd, and sad, plot twists -- but after seeing either The Host or Lady Vengeance, you know you\\'re in the presence of a major talent. (Both of these movies played at the New York Film Festival, and roused crowds accustomed to rather more sedate fare. Bong\\'s earlier film, Memories of Murder, available on DVD, is also a genre picture with downbeat twists, and it has some interesting similarities to, and differences from, the new film Zodiac.)\\n\\nThe photography and editing of The Host are top-notch. The Han River location is vividly evoked, and the chases that take place near -- and beneath -- the river bank are breathtakingly well done. The Park family\\'s journey isn\\'t very long geographically, but it takes on the nature of a heroic quest, even though as heroes they have their ups and downs. Gang-du\\'s sister Nam-joo (played by Bae Doo-na) is a champion archer (well, a bronze medalist) whose Achilles heel is being a little too&hellip; slow to let the arrow fly -- and this becomes a witty visual joke at various points in the movie. Their brother Nam-il (Park Hae-il) seems at first a worthless, belligerent young drunk, but he proves his worth as the adventure continues. Gang-du himself is a bit of a goofy, shiftless layabout, but as events give his life a grim purpose, actor Song Kang-ho skillfully transforms the character into a real hero of sorts. (Actors Park and Song were also in Memories of Murder.)\\n\\nThe plot is sometimes sketchy, unc onvincing, even silly, as is the satirical way the army and health officials are portrayed. But the movie has enough energy to ride over these faults. When the family\\'s quest takes a tragic turn, however, it feels like a miscalculation -- the tone has been mostly fast and smartass up to that point, and one may not know how to react to the jarring shift. This may be just what director Bong has in mind, however, being a bit of an absurdist, gleefully mixing the comic and the sad.\\n\\nSo you may or may not feel completely satisfied by the story itself. But if you\\'re a monster movie aficionado, this is a monster you won\\'t want to miss. And if you\\'re interested in the Asian movies that have been expanding and subverting genres, such as Lady Vengeance and Infernal Affairs (the Hong Kong film on which The Departed is based), Bong Joon-ho is a director to watch -- and The Host is a good place to start. \\nHandyguy (aka Randall Byrn) is a marketing director at a business magazine\\'s conference division in New York. A transplanted Southerner, he has been a movie buff since birth. He\\'s always secretly wanted to be Pauline Kael, and blogcritics gives him an approximation of that, or so he likes to fantasize at least. Handy has a film degree from USC.\\n\\u2028Notes\\n\\n\\n\\nThe views expressed on blogs distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (\"Blogs via Newstex\") are solely the author\\'s and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

       "  'text': 'Apr. 27--Science gone wrong!\\nA military mobilized!\\nAn (Asian) nation terrified!\\nA creature who would not die!\\nWith 1,000 teeth! 10,000 eyes!\\nFrom the ocean floor!\\nSigh.\\nAs a moviegoer who grew up on Boston\\'s Creature Double Feature (back-to-back marauding-giant-monster movies, every Saturday afternoon on a scratchy UHF channel), as a rational adult who pays taxes and buys milk, as a journalist who goes to movies for a living, I must say, it is one of the disappointments of my professional life that big green slimy beasts, with legs as thick as redwoods and claws that tear up pavement, climbing from a toxic river to lay waste to a feckless mankind, are far too rare.\\nI see 17 talking animal cartoons a year. I watch 34 odd serial killer pictures, and catch a baker\\'s dozen of war movies and my share of films about horny teenagers. I sit though 73 films every 12 months with Judi Dench and/or Jude Law -- but the descendants of Godzilla have remained, oddly, trapped in the primordial ooze from whence they came.\\nLaugh, snicker -- put The Queen at the top of your Netflix queue for all I care!\\nA puckish new South Korean export, The Host, which opens in Toledo today, makes a convincing, and playfully deranged, argument that the giant-monster genre is far more malleable than we imagined.\\nYes, it\\'s a monster movie, first and foremost, sure. But oh, it argues, your typical Asian monster mash can be a dysfunctional family drama, or a political satire, a cautionary environmental warning, or a straight-out comedy, a governmental farce about ineffectual bureaucrats, or a metaphor for the American military presence in South Korea, or a reminder of the ingenuity of children -- and so on.\\nDirector Bong Joon-ho, who indeed grew up not far from a U.S. military base, picks all of the above. As messy as the overall shebang may be -- here is a picture in a constant pitched battle over what mood or point it wants to convey -- it\\'s not overstating to say it handles every last one of those far-flung goals, individually, with equal wit and grace. In fact, that shaggy, loose-limbed quality is what makes it more than a monster movie. It\\'s got charm to spare. Since its premiere last year in South Korea, The Host has become the biggest smash in that country\\'s history, a literal Bong hit; and when I saw it last October at the New York Film Festival (I\\'ve since seen it two more times), the crush of highbrow cinema snobs pushing to get into a midnight screening threatened to become a black-rectangular-eyeglass-frame battle royale.\\nStill not convinced?\\nTwo images stick.\\nThe first is the initial, lyrical sighting of the monster -which is something else, let me tell you. We are witness to a Day Everything Changed, though it starts out a Day Like Any Other. Families picnic and dogs bark and the sun shines along the Han River, a wide strip of water that cuts through downtown Seoul. A line forms at the family-run snack van, until someone shouts, \"Hey, what\\'s that?\" And someone else shouts, \"It\\'s moving,\" and now everyone in the park is standing and pointing and gasping, and the tension ratchets up with each passing second: Hanging from the steel beams of a huge bridge that spans the Han, maybe a hundred yards away, is a long dollop of ... something ugly, a large fluttering tonsil of sorts.\\nIt unfurls its body, back-flips cleanly from girder to girder, and jackknifes into the water with barely a splash. The crowds ahhs. A few snap photos with their cell phones. The creature glides just under the water\\'s surface, along the bank. Nobody breathes. Then someone hits it with a beer can. Great. It leaps from the Han. It\\'s full-grown and irate. It resembles a large tadpole with legs, like the result of sex between a rhinoceros and a school bus.\\nThe other image comes in the end -- actually, it\\'s the last shot (but it gives nothing away). The family who runs that snack van is sharing a meal. They\\'ve been through a lot. Summer\\'s gone and winter\\'s arrived. The camera pulls back until their tiny home is now a tiny island, the warm yellow glow of the light in the window, a swirl of snow gusting across the ground, and nobody else in sight.\\nGodzilla never had ennui.\\nBut then The Host is the last thing you expect: a monster movie with a soul, a creature feature that uses the creature to get at something unexpected -- a snapshot of generations struggling to pull together. It starts with a familiar B-movie set-up, though, one with pointed political purpose: An American scientist orders his Korean assistant to pour 200 gallons of formaldehyde down the drain. The underling protests. But the scientist cuts him off: \"I am not used to repeating myself!\" Ah, the folly of man!\\nWill they never stop meddling with nature!?!\\nCut to six years later, and we meet the Park family. Grandpa is a timid provider, weak in the knees, quick to bow to anyone in a uniform. His children are adult failures: There\\'s the college graduate who can\\'t get a job and dreams of his Molotov cocktail pro-democracy riot days (he may get a chance to re-live those); there\\'s the professional archer (always handy in a monster movie) who always chokes, and there\\'s the oldest, with a bad dye job, forever falling asleep when you need him. No one gets along. The one family member who isn\\'t a mess is the grandchild, Hyun-seo (play by an exquisite young actress named Ah Sung Ko). But when monster meets matriarch, to the grief of the family, Hyun-seo is captured. The Parks mount a rescue attempt. Or rather, they try.\\nFrom here, like many a South Korean film, The Host spreads out in as many directions as that monster\\'s jaw -- which unfolds like a malevolent flower. But the emotions are real and the focus is squarely on the characters. The film sags in its midsection, but that\\'s out of ambition and willingness to chase an idea. The government overreacts and falls back into old authoritarian habits. Unlike old monster movies, in the new ones, like this one, the authorities are not your first choice when disaster strikes. The Parks wind up facing a bureaucracy as brutal as the beast. The military scapegoats. The visiting authorities (that\\'s us, the U.S.) stonewall. If Godzilla was born of a nuclear blast, here is a monster born of new anxieties, and of course, we get the scary creature we deserve.\\nContact Christopher Borrelli at: cborrelli@theblade.com or 419-724-6117.\\nCopyright (c) 2007, The Blade, Toledo, Ohio Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News.

In fact, the South Korean release is gearing up as a Best Picture frontrunner[3] heading into Oscars 2020. Director Bong Joon-ho's latest film defies genre to tell a complex story about two interconnected families and, by extension, delivers some crucial social commentary[4].With Parasite#8216;s success, we're sure moviegoers will be interested to see some of Bong's previous work. Prior to his Oscar-nominated hit[5], the director had made six films. Here's a quick breakdown of the features he has directed throughout his career. \\n Bong Joon-ho and the cast of #8216;Parasite' at the Screen ActorsGuild Awards | John Sciulli/Getty Images for Turner#8216;Barking Dogs Never Bite' (2000)Barking Dogs Never Bite (Trailer)[6]In his 2000 directorial debut, Bong already aimed to combine genres in an innovative way. This dark comedy-drama follows an unemployed college professor (Lee Sung-jae) who begins abusing and kidnapping dogs the barking dogs in his apartment building. At the same time, a young woman (Bae Doona) takes note of his activities, launching an investigation into the surge of missing dogs. Despite its bizarre-sounding premise, Barking Dogs Never Bite gave Bong the chance to try his hand at directing a feature. Prior to this film, the [7]Parasite[8] filmmaker[9] had only directed three short films. However, he previously earned writing credits on 1997's Motel Cactus and 1999's Phantom: The Submarine. #8216;Memories of Murder' (2003)Memories of Murder (2003) - movie trailer[10]In his 2003 sophomore effort, Bong landed his first collaboration with Song Kang-ho. The actor delivers a critically acclaimed standout performance in [11]Parasite[12]. Song has sustained an ongoing collaboration with Bong over the course of both their careers.In Memories of Murder, the actor andKim Sang-kyung play two detectives trying to solve the real-life case of Korea's first serial murders. The investigation continued from 1986 to 1991, and the film — based on a 1996 play — earned strong reviews for its depiction and performances. #8216;The Host' (2006)The Host (2006) #8212; Trailer[13]Memories of Murder gained Bong international acclaim. But The Host solidified him as a commercially successful filmmaker. The film follows a man's (Song) effort to rescue his daughter after she is kidnapped by a giant monster.At the time of its release, The Host became the highest-grossing South Korean movie of all time. Although mainstream success in the United States eluded Bong, this film was a critical step in establishing his reputation for offbeat, inventive genre projects.  #8216;Mother' (2009)Mother Official HD Trailer - From the Director of THE HOST[14]No, this one has nothing to do with either the 1996 Albert Brooks film or the 2017 Darren Aronofsky release[15]. Rather, this Mother follows a mother's (Kim Hye-ja) search for the killer responsible for framing her son (Won Bin) for murder.It might not have received as much attention stateside as some of Bong's other films. However, Mother was still a critical smash in South Korea and beloved by critics. As has become Bong's trademark, the movie expertly combines a number of genres, including family drama, horror, and comedy. #8216;Snowpiercer' (2013)Snowpiercer Official US Release Trailer #1 (2014) - Chris Evans Movie HD[16]Bong made his English-language directorial debut with this dystopian sci-fi thriller. Led by Chris Evans, the film features an all-star cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Octavia Spencer, Jamie Bell, John Hurt, Ed Harris, and — of course — Song. It's also the most expensive Korean production in history.Snowpiercer is set aboard the titular train, which carries the last remnants of the human race. The film tackles key issues such as climate change but does so in a way that never fails to be thrilling. In fact, its success — much like that of [17]Parasite[18] — has inspired a new TV series[19]. #8216;Okja' (2017)Okja | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix[20]This Netflix film might be a lot of moviegoers' first exposure to Bong. Part of that comes from its accessibility on the streaming service. Yet, Okja — Bong's second consecutive English-language release[21] — is just as much in line with his distinctive sensibility as his other films.The movie centers on a genetically modified creature named Okja, its friendship with a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun), and her efforts to protect it. Okja also features an international cast which combines South Korean performers with stars like Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul Dano, and Swinton.

       "  'text': \"How does one get rid of a parasite?\\nBong Joon Ho sets the tone for the Oscar-nominated, Cannes Palme d'Or 2019-winner and Golden Globes 2020 Best Foreign Language Film-winner Parasite in the first scene itself. A family of four, living in a semi-basement level home, scouts the corners of their house to find WiFi signal. The neighbour must have changed the password, let's try 123456789 or in reverse. Still not working? Oops, no WhatsApp then.\\nKim Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho) leads an unambitious family with wife Chung-sook (played by Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Kim Ki-jeong (played by Park So-dam) and son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik). Their current source of income is folding pizza boxes for a pizza delivery joint, and it doesn't take someone solid knowledge in World Cinema to know that that money isn't going to be enough to feed four grown mouths. But, they have a plan, as Kim Ki-taek elaborates - it is to not have a plan at all. For then, the risk of anything going wrong is nil.\\nWatch the trailer of Parasite here:\\nParasite is, therefore, a story of submission. On one end of the spectrum, the Kim family has submitted to their condition never improving, of scavenging through life. On the other end of the spectrum, the Park family has submitted to never peeping out of their ivory towers. They don't need to. Their ivory towers are guarded with surveillance cameras and windows are sealed with tempered glasses, monitoring even the sunlight seeping in. Led by Park Dong-ik (played by Lee Sun-kyun) with wife Yeon-gyo (played by Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Park Da-hye (played by Jeong Ji-so) and son Park Da-song (played by Jung Hyeon-jun), the Park family doesn't live in a bubble; they live in a fortress, fortified by wilful ignorance.\\nRead: Why Bong Joon Ho's Parasite rises beyond the subtitle barrier\\nAnd then their worlds collide. The Kim family slowly and steadily creeps into the Park family, landing odd jobs with them, eliminating the competition as they move ahead. The son takes up the job of the English tutor replacing a friend, the daughter becomes the art teacher to the son, playing a hapless (and clueless) mother; the father lands the job of the driver replacing the older one, and finally, the older housekeeper is practically thrown out overnight and replaced with the mother. All this without letting the Parks catch a whiff that the Kims know each other, lest their finally steady quadruple income is snatched away. But the whiff is too strong, too strong coming from poverty.\\nThe more they collide, the more apparent their differences get. They are separated by class, a difference that is almost flowing in their bloodstreams now, they are basically sweating class difference. It appears the Kims have gotten so used to living in hiding that they'd prefer living the life of a parasite, rather than disclose they are related and have a fair chance at being judged on the basis of their good work. Even they don't think they are worth it. Of course, the Parks don't either.\\nThrough Parasite, Bong Joon Ho gives you a very clear picture of the South Korean society, or of any other place where unequal distribution and growth of wealth have resulted in the 'rich becoming richer, poor becoming poorer' model. This could very well be the story of a family living in the slums of Dharavi, juxtaposed against another living in that plush skyrise on Altamount Road, both in Mumbai. Which is why it hits so hard.\\nIn Parasite, the cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and editing by Jinmo Yang (nominated in the Best Achievement in Film Editing category at Oscars 2020) deserve a special mention. Staring out the window at Parks', you soak in the lush green of their front yard, while at the Kims', there's a drunkard peeing at the lamppost, who wouldn't stop even if you were to throw a bucket of water at him. But the visuals of those water droplets twinkling against the light from the lamppost, in slow motion, and the good laugh the have-nots like the Kim family share at that moment, is like poetry.\\nThe storytelling style of Parasite is also unique. Bong Joon Ho goes from dark comedy to absurd comedy, to simply dark, and then darker. Finally, it touches a point of hope, and while one could look at it as just hope, it could also be the point where the film reached its darkest - for there is no hope. Let's just submit to that, shall we?\\nBong Joon Ho had said at an interview that the idea for Parasite had been in his brain for a while - like a parasite, if you will. We're glad he didn't get rid of it, though.\\n(The Delhi premiere of Parasite was organised by the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in India.)\\n(Writer tweets as @NotThatNairita)\\nALSO READ |Joaquin Phoenix's Joker to re-release in India on February 14\\nALSO READ | Joaquin Phoenix on Joker leading Oscars 2020 nominations: Honoured by the Academy's recognition\\nALSO READ |Oscars 2020: 92nd Academy Awards full nominations list\\nALSO READ | Joaquin Phoenix wins Best Actor for Joker at Golden Globes 2020: The ascent after the descent\\nALSO READ | Joaquin Phoenix and director Todd Phillips may reunite for Joker sequel\\nALSO READ | Joker trailer out: Joaquin Phoenix film traces the origins of Batman's most terrifying enemy\\nALSO READ | Joker to now release in India on October 2, will clash with Hrithik Roshan's War\\nALSO WATCH | Joaquin Phoenix's Joker gets 8 minute standing ovation at Venice Premiere\\nLink to Image\\n\\u2028Graphic\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nParasite Movie Review: Bong Joon Ho film is like poetry\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Feb 10, 2020( The Cheat Sheet: http://www.cheatsheet.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  The Oscars certainly don't think Bong Joon Ho is an idiot. They honored him awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best International Feature[1] for Parasite. HBO doesn't either. They're developing a       \\xa0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bong-joon-hos-parasite-slated-for-hbo-show-what-we-know.html/TV serie[2]s based on the film. \\nHowever, not everyone making Parasite was so enamored with Director[3] Bong. The architect who built the house in which Bong set the film[4] had strong words for him. Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment Parasite is now available on DVD and Blu-ray[5]. In the bonus features, Bong gives a Q&A at a film festival screening. Here is the story of why the architect of the Parasite house called Bong an idiot. Bong Joon Ho built the house into the #8216;Parasite' script The Park family house was the central location of all the events in Parasite. The Kim family installs themselves as help in the Park house and that's where things get crazy[6]. The Parks' lavish house had to be built to spec for Bong. Park So-dam and Choi Woo-sik in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;Even since we began building the set for the rich house, I had a lot of requests. I already had a basic sketch of the house structure in mind when I was writing the script. Without that certain structure, it was almost impossible to tell the narrative. Also there are a lot of things that were necessary for the story in terms of the structure. If some characters are talking here, another character had to eavesdrop or peak. You had to be able to see the staircase through the front door. There were these several requirements I had.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayBong Joon Ho consulted a real architect for #8216;Parasite' Bong sent production designer Lee Ha-jun to meet with real architects about the Parasite house. The architects were not fond of the screenplay's demands. L-R: Choi Woo-Shik, Song Kang-ho, Chang Hyae-jin and Park So-dam in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;So the production designer actually sought out advice from actual architects to build this house. The production designer would take my request to the actual architect and the architect would be like, #8216;What kind of idiot would build houses this way? No one builds houses this way. So the architect would come back to me with those comments and I would still have all these things that I requested from him. So he really suffered between me and the architect. Ultimately the house came out beautifully. I was able to get all the structure and the blocking that the story required.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayOne scene that paid off the unorthodox in #8216;Parasite' An example of a scene that utilized the specific design of the house is one in which the Kims hide in the bedroom while the Parks have sex. Bong Joon Ho and interpreter Sharon Choi | Kevin Winter/Getty Images #8216;In reality it's very rare for the rich and poor to come so close to each other that they can smell one another. In this film you have situations where they come very close to one another through tutoring or housekeeping and driving. And that sex scene is sort of on the pinnacle of that strange intimacy. It's not really about the sex. It's about the family that's hiding under the table and peeping at that very intimate part of their private lives. So I thought it would give a really powerful tension in the film.#8217; Bong Joon Ho, Parasite DVD and Blu-rayBong Joon Ho built more than the house The Park house was the major build for Parasite, but Bong had to build a few other sets for other scenes in the movie. Lee Sun-kyun and Jo Yeo-jeong in Parasite | Neon CJ Entertainment #8216;Another thing that was difficult was the poor house and the neighborhood surrounding that house,#8217; Bong said. #8216;They were also sets that we built. Also because we had to flood the entire neighborhood, we built it in a giant swimming pool, a water tank and on the last day of shooting, we poured in sewage water. It looks like dirty water. It was very clean water for the actors. It had the face masks in the water, like mud face masks, very healthy and good for your skin.#8217; Read the original article from The Cheat Sheet[7] [ 1]: https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-makes-history-with-2020-oscar-nominations-best-picture.html/ [ 2]:       \\xa0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bong-joon-hos-parasite-slated-for-hbo-show-what-we-know.html/ [ 3]:       \\xa0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/oscars-2020-what-movies-has-parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-made.html/ [ 4]:       \\xa0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/beyond-fest-review-parasite-peachy-con.html/ [ 5]:       \\xa0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-is-the-oscar-nominated-film-based-on-a-true-story.html/ [ 6]:       \\xa0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-explains-the-cruel-and-sad-ending-of-the-award-winning-film.html/ [ 7]:       \\xa0    https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/parasite-director-bong-joon-ho-says-the-architect-of-his-movie-house-thought-he-was-an-idiot.html/\",\n",

    "For reviews of _Parasite_ the trigram frequency list shows a lot of emphasis on the awards that the movie won. So one theme in this list would be `win` or `awards`. As we can see, there are trigrams in the top 30 list that include:\n",
    "* `cannes film festival`\n",
    "* `the academy awards`\n",
    "* `film to win`\n",
    "* `best international feature`\n",

    "* `best original screenplay`\n",
    "* `win best picture`\n",
    "* `to win best`\n",
    "* `at the oscars`\n",
    "\n",
    "What's also very notable is that for the trigram frequency list again, we see more emphasis on the movie's presence in America, so the second theme would be `USA`. These include the following phrases in the top 30 list:\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I was able to run both sentiment analysis (using VADER) and frequency analysis on the critic reviews of both movies. Overall, the sentiment analysis shows that there were higher average positive sentiment scores for critic reviews of _Parasite_ than _The Host_ and this supports my hypothesis that _Parasite_ was more well-received. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing I'll have to note is that VADER does have its limitations, since it only focuses on individual words and therefore the context or nuances of language might be lost. Therefore, I'll try running the same kind of sentiment analysis for these reviews using another Python NLP processor called TextBlob, which has its own sentiment analyzer. I will explore this in the notebook titled `trying_TextBlob_SA`, so make sure to check that out too! \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook was helpful for making broad conclusions about the critic reviews. Let's move onto analyzing user reviews in the other notebooks with titles starting with `analysis`...! Thanks!"
