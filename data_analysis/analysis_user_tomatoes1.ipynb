    "# Analysis of User Reviews from Rotten Tomatoes Pt. 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "In my notebooks titled `tomatoes_host_user` and `tomatoes_parasite_user`, I went through the Rotten Tomatoes website (site that contains movie reviews) and scraped user reviews of [_The Host_](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_host_2007) and [_Parasite_](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/parasite_2019), respectively. After scraping, cleaning, and organizing the user review data for both movies, I wrote them out as JSON files so that I can run my series of analyses on the data! \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, similar to the steps I went through in the notebook called `analysis_user_metacritic`, I will be going through user review data of both movies, and again, the overall question I'm trying to answer is: **Was _Parasite_ more well-received (higher percentage of positively rated reviews, higher sentiment scores throughout reviews) than _The Host_**? \n",
    "\n",
    "I will split up my analysis into 5 parts, and only parts 1-2 are in this notebook. Analyses 3-5 are in the next notebook titled `analysis_user_tomatoes2`. Here is the full list of my analyses:\n",
    "1. Looking at positively, neutrally, and negatively rated reviews of each movie \n",
    "2. Keyness analysis & KWIC concordance analysis for pos and neg reviews\n",
    "3. Using VADER to run sentiment analysis round 1\n",
    "4. Using the NRC VAD Lexicon for sentiment analysis round 2\n",
    "5. Using the NRC Emotion Lexicon for sentiment analysis round 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the bulk of my project and what will help me answer my overall research question, relies on **sentiment analysis!** I'm very excited to see what results we'll end up with, and how we can better understand the public audience sentiment of both movies!\n",

       "  'text': \"Doing my best to keep this spoiler free, I would say that the film is watchable and it's probably worth seeing if only for social reasons as it does crop up here and there is most of my social circles that include movie fans.\\n\\nThe plot centres on the misfortunes of a family and their ability to take advantage of their son getting his foot in the door of a lucrative opportunity. It's then a story of how things can escalate when you get into a situation you aren't in control of to begin with and the stakes keep raising. There are no glaring problems with the plot or characters, unless (I'm told) you happen to be familiar with South Korean culture. And the film does a decent job of making you care about most of the characters in it as it appropriately develops most of the characters in it so you can understand them as people.\\n\\nThe problem comes in when you really start to pay attention to the characters and the decisions that they make. At it's core it poses the assumption that if you give someone an inch, they will take a mile. Which isn't unreasonable, until I add in that the mile would include driving over people, friends included, then it's a whole lot less reasonable and is only believable if we are talking about psychopaths.\\n\\nIn the same way while the situation might initially seem understandable you are doomed if you ever ask yourself the question; but would you? If you and your family were in a desperate situation would you risk it all for more when the chance of you getting busted is actually pretty high? Probably not. If you were to seemingly succeed, would you repeat the process? Well, maybe since you were daft enough to try it again, but really, why would you? The film makes no effort to explain why they keep choosing to escalate the situation when they seem to move out of the most desperate situation immediately after acquiring the first opportunity, which was given to them legitimately. Instead they plough ahead taking risk after risk, then pretty soon the characters seem to forget how precarious their position is and make several obviously terrible decisions which act as a catalyst for further escalating situations. Culminating into an entirely avoidable situation.\\n\\nThe biggest problem of all is that the means they use to go about setting up these further opportunities draw attention to how wicked they are as people and really sets you against them despite their own struggles. You then spend much of the film rooting for them to fail as much as you are hoping for everything to turn out alright, because although they were clearly desperate, it's equally apparent that they are bad people who don't hesitate to put other people in a situation as desperate as they have been in, so long as it's not them. I get the sense that this is supposed to be a duality within the film, but when one side completely overpowers the other, it doesn't work at all. The various bad circumstances that afflict the characters in no way comes even close to justifying their actions against others and just cements that fact that they are people who ultimately deserve to lose.\\n\\nThat being said, the acting, which I have seen criticised, isn't bad. It's not Hollywood A-list but then placing that kind of expectation on them is unreasonable and they easily outperform some actors/actresses in Hollywood who have had repeated work in the industry. The music is perfectly crafted to enhance the experience and it's clear no expense nor effort was sparing in the sets. It's an experience that is only harmed by how obscene the choices the characters make and keep making.\\n\\nWhile you are watching you could become engrossed enough to forget these kinds of details and considerations, and if you can do that you will enjoy it. If you have an eye for the particulars however, Parasite is fundamentally no different from a B-list horror movie where the situation only happens because of continued awful decisions on the part of the main cast. I don't feel that this fundamentally a bad movie, despite how much I may have gone on about its flaws, but it's not something you are every likely to watch twice and I seriously doubt it's something that will be remembered as anything other than 'that foreign film that won best picture that one time'\"}]"

    "* This is a stark contrast from the division between positive and negative rated reviews of _The Host_ ! For these user reviews of _Parasite_ that I've collected, it looks like they consist of overwhelmingly positive than negative or neutral scored reviews. \n",
    "* We can see that about 79.5% of reviews are positively rated (above 4 stars), versus about 20.5% of reviews are negatively (below 3 stars) or neutrally rated (between 3 and 4). \n",
    "* Another intriguing observation is that among negative or neutral reviews, there are more neutral reviews (1618) than negative ones (852) for _The Host_ whereas for _Parasite_ there are more negative reviews (538) than neutral (368) among this group. What this tells us is that for _The Host_ there were more neutral ratings and less polarization on either side of the rating spectrum, but for _Parasite_ we see that there is more polarization, since there's less neutral reviews and more on the extreme sides of the spectrum (pos or neg).\n",

I find it fascinating because this points directly to what Director Bong Joon Ho famously said: \"Once you overcome the 1-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.\" He was alluding to the American aversion to foreign movies because they have to watch dubbed versions or because they are averse to subtitles/translations, and this is what we start to see in the negative rated reviews. \n",
