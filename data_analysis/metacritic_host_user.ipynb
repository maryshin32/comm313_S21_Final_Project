The film depicts the after effects of a nuclear tests that has resulted in huge killer ants. Apparently, after years of being stepped on and killed with ant bait, the species was pissed at humans and were not afraid to show it. 52 years later, the same phenomenon arose in South Korea. Except, it presented the chance for fish to exact their revenge on humanity after millenia of being prey. And exact revenge is certainly the only thing this fish monster is interested in. Created as a result of an American scientist's unwillingness to properly dispose of formaldehyde, this fish is out to wreak havoc on the race that brought it into existence in the name of all of its fish friends. The Host is a truly thrilling, emotionally moving, oddly funny, and expertly executed science fiction film with clear political undertones.\r",
      " Often times, films such as that offer some emotional moments wind up being far too sentimental. Bong Joon-ho avoids this trap by showcasing real, raw emotion. The pain showcased by all of the characters and the family bonds that are tested through these traumatic events bring an incredible sense of realism. These moments are not overdone or overly emotional. Rather, they are impassioned, low-key, and subtle. What is not subtle, however, is the love held by Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) for his daughter Park Hyun-seo (Go Ah-sung). The two's love for one another as father and daughter is terrifically developed and feels authentic to the point that when things go awry for the two, your heart bleeds for them.\r",
      " The emotional authenticity is just one solid element of this film, as the entirety of the characters are well developed. Though there is not a ton of depth given the type of film this is, what is introduced is always purposeful and used later on in the climax. This is emblematic of how tight this film is with very little filler, both in dialogue and in the general plot. The film shows us what it needs to in order for us to understand what is occurring. There are very few, if any, moments that really feel out of place or do not add to the story. While every scene is obviously not perfect, they all have a purpose and flow together incredibly well. Heck, even the odd moments of comedy tossed in the film, particularly in the refugee camp, work out pretty well and do showcase elements of the characters.\r",
      " Cinematography-wise, there are a few scenes that stood out to me as being particularly well shot, namely the shot during the protest as agent yellow is released. The shot of the group of people standing with \"Free Park Gang-du\" shirts and being overtaken by agent yellow is tragic and beautifully executed. The shot itself is incredibly well framed with terrific use of color. Additionally, the final shot of the snack bar set against the ocean as snow falls to the ground was incredibly beautiful.\r",
      " Politically, the message is clear: Bong Joon-ho does not like American or outside influence in South Korea. The military, American personnel in Korea, the doctors, and even the CDC are all shown negatively for exploiting the Koreans and not caring about what happens to them. Instead, they are shown as being more obsessed with Americans, their needs, and how it will effect the United States should any possible monster or virus appear in North America. The name \"agent yellow\" especially drives this home as it draws a direct link to Agent Orange in Vietnam and the disastrous effects it had on the Vietnamese and Americans in the country. Though Americans may not be literally killing Koreans at this point, it is clear that Bong Joon-ho is fearful that if their present level of indifference continues, the day in which Koreans die because of Americans is not far off. Thus, the film is not explicitly anti-American to me. Rather, it is a warning of what could happen and something that both sides should be aware of and planned ahead for.\r",
      " As a whole, The Host provides thrills, emotion, and political overtones in this film about a fish monster killing people and taking them hostage (presumably to eat later). Though imperfect as it does have some iffy pacing at times and the ending feeling a little fortunate, The Host is still an incredibly tight and thrilling experience offered by Bong Joon-ho. Somehow, this is only my second film from him (Snowpiercer being the other). Clearly, I need to see more, even if Snowpiercer was just okay.… Expand\n",

This critique was done with a clever mixture of drama and comedy behind the backdrop of a monster story and filled with far more symbolism than I've ever seen in any European or American film. The cinematography and the special effects were also more than decent.\r",

This is monster movie making in the great Japanese tradition, although with better special effects. Like Godzilla, the monstrosity in The Host has been awakened and mutated by modern technology. This is what happens when you pollute the water! The film's best scenes are those involving Hyun-seo trapped in the creature's lair.

Indeed, most of the scenes involving the monster are riveting, especially its high energy first appearance and the tense final standoff. Every time the movie becomes somnambulant (a lapse that occurs too often), the creature makes an appearance to give a jolt of energy to the story and the audience.\\n\\nFans of B-grade monster movies will find things to appreciate about The Host, but even die-hards will notice how disjointed things become. I can accept the half-hearted attempts at character development (at least one of which, wherein the characters doze off, should have been cut) and the sometimes cheesy special effects, but the movie's attempts at humor are forced and the political aspects of the storyline bloat the running length to the point where The Host threatens to wear out its welcome.

    "Gross-out horror is never far from comedy and The Host, Bong Joon-ho's giddy creature feature, has an anarchic mess factor worthy of a pile of old Mad magazines. A broadly played clown show full of lowbrow antics, Bong's big splat is itself a sort of monster—the top grossing movie in South Korean history—and, since it surfaced at Cannes last May, festival audiences having been slurping it down like ramen.\n",
    "The Host's main attraction is a mutant carnivore-cum-somersaulting slimeball. As Mad once \"animated\" a garbage dump called the Heap, so The Host presents what might be a chunk of phlegm hawked from the maw of our despoiled earth. This killer tadpole can swim like a fish, scuttle like an insect, and run like a Spielberg raptor. Even more than the 1933 King Kong, Bong's creature is a surreal entity with no fixed size. As the materialization of dread, this nameless monster is harder to pin down than the radioactive, fire-breathing Godzilla. It's an \"It.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bong's allegory is deliberately free-floating; still, that the thing has its origins in American stupidity and hubris is made clear in The Host's prologue, set in a morgue on a U.S. Army base. Offended by the dust on some unused bottles of formaldehyde, an overbearing American officer orders a hapless Mr. Kim to dump gallons of toxic chemicals down the drain and into the Han River. A few years pass and two fishermen spot something gross swimming in the murk. . . . Cut to the wacky dysfunctional family who operate a riverside fast-food stand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Park clan consists of an elderly patriarch and his two deadbeat sons—one a slob, the other a drunk—and a daughter who is a championship archer with an unfortunate psychological hitch. There's also 11-year-old granddaughter Hyun-seo, courtesy of the slob—busy dishing out fried squid when he realizes that, down by the river, picnickers are transfixed by something suspended beneath the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The It falls into the water and swims over. Ordinary people, being what they are, merrily pelt the unknown creature with garbage until, with projectile force, it bounds ashore and the chase is on—thud, grab, leaping lizards! Establishing a galumphing tone of carnivalesque terror that trumps just about everything to follow, this picnic panic is a comic replay of 9/11 or even Sergei Eisenstein's \"Odessa Steps.\" Then the thing dives back into the river, scattering a gaggle of swan-shaped paddleboats, with little Hyun-seo in its fishy clutches. From then on, it's personal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the original, Japanese version of Godzilla, The Host gives catastrophe a naturalistic follow-through.

       "'\\n\"The Host\": It rose from American slime to destroy the Korean family! It must be destroyed!\\nYes, the fishy, flippery, 60-foot-long thingummy who emerges from the polluted waters of the Han River in central Seoul to terrorize the populace in \"The Host\" is the result of poison from an American military facility. Well, what the hell else would cause such a horrible mutation? The fertilizer off Uncle Hang-soo\\'s farm? I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nThere\\'s no question that Bong Joon-ho\\'s film, which is the most satisfying monster movie in many years, takes some easy shots at the American military-technological colossus, and at the Korean government\\'s sheepdog-like subservience to it. I\\'m inclined to interpret pretty much any junky old movie as a dialectical critique of whateverness, but in this case both the sanctimonious leftists and the contrarian critics are reading way too much into this simultaneously big-hearted and farcical adventure.\\n\\n\"The Host\" may have one foot in the allegorical and mysterious world of contemporary Asian horror cinema, but the other one is closer to the sentimental big-screen spectacles of Steven Spielberg, or even Frank Capra. Bong\\'s human villains are about as ambiguous as his monster: The Americans are diabolical Strangeloves and the Koreans are two-faced sycophants. His hero, on the other hand, is Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a middle-aged loser with a bad blond \\'do who slumbers away the days at his dad\\'s riverside squid shack. (That isn\\'t any kind of a joke: Koreans really, really like squid.)\\n\\nGang-du\\'s dad (Byeon Hie-bong) is a grump and complainer, his beautiful sister (Bae Du-na) is a champion archer who loses an international match through indecision, and his brother (Park Hae-il) is an embittered alcoholic. About the only sensible one is Gang-du\\'s daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung), a resourceful little person of about 9 who puts up with this family as patiently as she can manage. Do you suppose coming face-to-face with a giant mutant whatzit will give this struggling family a chance at redemption, or what?\\n\\nThere\\'s tragedy beneath the funniest bits of \"The Host\" and humor beneath the most serious passages, which is one reason why I don\\'t think it should be viewed as some earnest political parable. When the big kahuna emerges from the muddy Han and begins gnawing up picnickers, the resulting chaos is both upsetting and comic -- at least until it grabs Hyun-seo and disappears. Even then, the film\\'s tone is constitutionally unsettled: At the stage-managed ceremony of public grieving after the monster\\'s first attack, the entire Park family collapses in a slapstick heap. As a stern orange-suited bureaucrat seeks to quarantine those who (like Gang-du) have actually touched the beast -- reputedly the host of a dangerous virus -- he wipes out in a pratfall worthy of Oliver Hardy.\\n\\nHyun-seo is gone, all right -- but is she really dead? After Gang-du gets a cellphone call from somewhere deep in the Han River sewer system, there is hope. Of course, as Gang-du explodes to a sinister American doctor late in the film, \"Nobody ever fucking listens to me!\" But our plucky family of working-class washouts doesn\\'t give up easily. Infighting and bickering all the way, they take on the Korean cops and military, the evil and meddlesome Yanks (who want to release a poison gas called Agent Yellow in the city center), and, oh yeah, a hideous mutant creature who has their beloved Hyun-seo stashed somewhere for some future snacktime.\\n\\nWhile the ignorance, hypocrisy and lies on display in \"The Host\" may result from America\\'s increasingly clumsy quest to subjugate the earth in the name of freedom, those are the tools of authority in all historical eras and all nations. It\\'s always those at the bottom of the food chain (those whom nobody ever fucking listens to!) who must battle the mutant monsters. On the margins of high-tech consumer society, the squid-shack proprietors will always be with us (as Jesus observed). \"The Host\" is a thrilling ride and a sometimes dry, sometimes sweet comedy, but beneath all that is a humane and tragic view of life worthy of the greatest films. Even those without rubber monsters.\\n'"

    "There's no question that Bong Joon-ho's film, which is the most satisfying monster movie in many years, takes some easy shots at the American military-technological colossus, and at the Korean government's sheepdog-like subservience to it. I'm inclined to interpret pretty much any junky old movie as a dialectical critique of whateverness, but in this case both the sanctimonious leftists and the contrarian critics are reading way too much into this simultaneously big-hearted and farcical adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Host\" may have one foot in the allegorical and mysterious world of contemporary Asian horror cinema, but the other one is closer to the sentimental big-screen spectacles of Steven Spielberg, or even Frank Capra. Bong's human villains are about as ambiguous as his monster: The Americans are diabolical Strangeloves and the Koreans are two-faced sycophants. His hero, on the other hand, is Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a middle-aged loser with a bad blond 'do who slumbers away the days at his dad's riverside squid shack. (That isn't any kind of a joke: Koreans really, really like squid.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gang-du's dad (Byeon Hie-bong) is a grump and complainer, his beautiful sister (Bae Du-na) is a champion archer who loses an international match through indecision, and his brother (Park Hae-il) is an embittered alcoholic. About the only sensible one is Gang-du's daughter Hyun-seo (Ko Ah-sung), a resourceful little person of about 9 who puts up with this family as patiently as she can manage. Do you suppose coming face-to-face with a giant mutant whatzit will give this struggling family a chance at redemption, or what?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's tragedy beneath the funniest bits of \"The Host\" and humor beneath the most serious passages, which is one reason why I don't think it should be viewed as some earnest political parable. When the big kahuna emerges from the muddy Han and begins gnawing up picnickers, the resulting chaos is both upsetting and comic -- at least until it grabs Hyun-seo and disappears. Even then, the film's tone is constitutionally unsettled: At the stage-managed ceremony of public grieving after the monster's first attack, the entire Park family collapses in a slapstick heap. As a stern orange-suited bureaucrat seeks to quarantine those who (like Gang-du) have actually touched the beast -- reputedly the host of a dangerous virus -- he wipes out in a pratfall worthy of Oliver Hardy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyun-seo is gone, all right -- but is she really dead? After Gang-du gets a cellphone call from somewhere deep in the Han River sewer system, there is hope. Of course, as Gang-du explodes to a sinister American doctor late in the film, \"Nobody ever fucking listens to me!\" But our plucky family of working-class washouts doesn't give up easily. Infighting and bickering all the way, they take on the Korean cops and military, the evil and meddlesome Yanks (who want to release a poison gas called Agent Yellow in the city center), and, oh yeah, a hideous mutant creature who has their beloved Hyun-seo stashed somewhere for some future snacktime.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the ignorance, hypocrisy and lies on display in \"The Host\" may result from America's increasingly clumsy quest to subjugate the earth in the name of freedom, those are the tools of authority in all historical eras and all nations. It's always those at the bottom of the food chain (those whom nobody ever fucking listens to!) who must battle the mutant monsters. On the margins of high-tech consumer society, the squid-shack proprietors will always be with us (as Jesus observed). \"The Host\" is a thrilling ride and a sometimes dry, sometimes sweet comedy, but beneath all that is a humane and tragic view of life worthy of the greatest films. Even those without rubber monsters.\n",

U.S. scientists have yet more dire news: the beast is the host for a deadly virus that could wipe out everyone in Seoul or-- dare we say it--the world!\\n\\nThe Host is itself a bizarre hybrid: both a popular hit (South Korea's all-time box-office champ) and a critics' choice, having played to acclaim at the Cannes and New York festivals. The film's plot is also pretty splitty: part old-time sea- or sewer-mutant movie in the tradition of Godzilla and Them! and part trigenerational comedy-drama about a weird family--sort of a Little Miss Korean Sunshine. The difference is that instead of a dead old man in the van, the Park family has a little girl (Ko A-sung) missing in the belly of the beast. Then director Bong Joon-ho sets one more plate spinning, with easy-to-spot political metaphors for U.S. influence in Korea and sleight-of-hand in Iraq.

    "It's big and ugly, and before it started terrorizing innocent Koreans, it was a tadpole. Then a careless American doctor at a local military base ordered hundreds of gallons of formaldehyde dumped into the Han River. The creature swallowed the toxin; now the thing is 30 ft. long, has 10 legs, looks like an angry Muppet and is itching for mischief. U.S. scientists have yet more dire news: the beast is the host for a deadly virus that could wipe out everyone in Seoul or-- dare we say it--the world!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Host is itself a bizarre hybrid: both a popular hit (South Korea's all-time box-office champ) and a critics' choice, having played to acclaim at the Cannes and New York festivals. The film's plot is also pretty splitty: part old-time sea- or sewer-mutant movie in the tradition of Godzilla and Them! and part trigenerational comedy-drama about a weird family--sort of a Little Miss Korean Sunshine. The difference is that instead of a dead old man in the van, the Park family has a little girl (Ko A-sung) missing in the belly of the beast. Then director Bong Joon-ho sets one more plate spinning, with easy-to-spot political metaphors for U.S. influence in Korea and sleight-of-hand in Iraq. If this madly entertaining movie has a fault, it's that it's too ingenious for the genre it ostensibly inhabits.\n",

       "'\\nHow come we get so many films about serial killers, teen-age libidos, and the Second World War, but nothing about giant mutant tadpoles? The imbalance has always struck me as unjust, and some of us have considered forming a pressure group to lobby for the inclusion of giant mutant tadpoles in mainstream cinema. Now the pressure is off, thanks to “The Host.” The director is Bong Joon-ho, and the mainstream in question is the Han, which flows through the center of Seoul. The rapid economic advance of South Korea in the nineteen-sixties and seventies is commonly known in the region as “the Miracle on the Han.” Here comes the downturn.\\n\\nSong Kangho and Ko Asung flee the monster in a new film from South Korea.\\nSong Kang-ho and Ko A-sung flee the monster in a new film from South Korea.R. KIKUO JOHNSON\\nIn the opening scene, a load of old formaldehyde, tipped down the drain by a lab technician, ends up in the waters of the Han. A few years later, we see the result, though we can’t quite make out what we are looking at: a dark, bulbous, comma-shaped form, drooping from the struts of a bridge. Slowly, it unfurls, like an Olympic diver, and drops neatly into the water. The good people of Seoul, amused by such novelty, toss beer cans at it and take snapshots on their cell phones. One of them glances sideways, at which point amusement comes to a halt—unlike the beast, which has hopped onto the embankment and is now pounding toward the crowd, plainly in search of a snack to go with the beer. Reading from back to front, we find: a lashing tail, which also functions as a lasso; legs as thick as a dinosaur’s, with claws that can churn up concrete; eyes as dull as glue; and a mouth that seems to peel open in many directions at once. The whole package is the size of a Greyhound bus, and extremely vexed about something. It looks like Broderick Crawford crossed with a Venus flytrap.\\n\\nObserving the monster is Gang-du (Song Kang-ho), a slob who runs a nearby food stand. He has yellow hair, the ability to fall asleep at any time, and—somewhat to our surprise—a young daughter, Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung). She gets caught up in the crowd’s chaotic flight from the monster, which promptly kidnaps her and, in obedience to the rules of fairy tale, bears her off to its lair. The rest of the film charts the efforts of Gang-du, aided by his family, to retrieve his only child from the dripping, bone-strewn sewer where she now resides. The story drags slightly in the middle, but there is no mistaking the rampant acceleration of the final act, in which all those present are called upon to save a life and, in so doing, to fulfill the task for which each of them is essentially equipped. For example, the hero’s sister, Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na), is a professional archer—always handy for those pesky dragonslaying situations that crop up so often these days. Her other brother, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), spends half the movie complaining that, as a college graduate, he can’t get a job, whereupon, at the climax, he turns into an angry student—preparing Molotov cocktails, like a soixante-huitard, and lobbing them at the leathery flanks of his foe.\\n\\nNo one can claim that we live in a golden age—or a bile-green, suppurating age—of movie monsters, and there will be plenty of filmgoers who yawned through “Godzilla” in 1998 and swore off large amphibians for good. All I can say, to tempt them back, is that I have seen “The Host” twice and have every intention of watching it again. Anyone who has taken the plunge into recent Korean movies (“Lady Vengeance” and “Oldboy,” say) will know that their impact springs not just from the verve of the storytelling but from a tendency to hurtle energetically from one mood to the next, merrily swapping the lyrical for the sadistic. It is as if Korean directors, refusing to observe the niceties of genre, offered value for money by packing several movies into one. The trick with “The Host,” the most successful release in the history of Korean cinema, is therefore to unpack it and inspect the contents.\\n\\nVIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKER\\n\\nWhat Went Wrong in the Sewol Ferry Disaster?\\n\\n\\nThe first component is shock, without which no monster movie can hope to thrive. “The Host” delivers a fine series of jolts, as the beast, which uses the industrial architecture of Seoul as an acrobat uses the parallel bars, swings suddenly out of the darkness. More unorthodox is the visual gag near the beginning, when Gang-du, fleeing the rampage, takes hold of his daughter’s hand, then loses it in the rush. The screen slows and turns quiet; his hand gropes for hers and finds it again, at which point we pull back to reveal that he has grabbed the wrong girl. This is typical of Bong Joon-ho: the setting may be outlandish, but the emotion—every parent’s fear—could hardly be more rooted in the real.\\n\\nSecond, there is the yuck factor. “The Host” is not especially bloody, and it will hold limited appeal for those macho viewers who like to test and prove themselves by cackling through a film like “Hostel,” which was little better than a dramatized abattoir. Nonetheless, the special effects have an insidious slither of their own. They were created by the Orphanage, the California company that worked on “Hellboy,” “Sin City,” and recent installments of Harry Potter and “Pirates of the Caribbean.” What the wizards have conjured for “The Host,” though, takes me back to the heyday of John Carpenter—specifically, to the flowering nastiness of “The Thing.” The emphasis is not on weaponry (the best defense turns out to be a metal pole) but on the organic, as befits a beast that was spawned by environmental pollution—watch it regurgitate victims like a mother disgorging fish to its young in “March of the Penguins.” At one point, Hyun-seo leaps into the air and stays there. For a few seconds, we don’t get it. (Bong likes to prolong the spell.) Then we switch angles, and all becomes clear: the girl is held aloft in the coils of the monster’s sticky tail.\\n\\nThird, Bong, like Carpenter, treats authority with the scorn of the prankster at the back of the class. Anyone in a uniform is fair game. Some guy in a yellow protective suit, seeking to inform the public of what has occurred on the Han, soon gives up and suggests weakly that people watch it on TV. When the girl’s family is held in a hospital, following rumors that the beast may be the source—the host—of a menacing virus, we get a delicate probing of the generational split. Gang-du’s father is all for mollifying the doctors, trying to slip them a sweetener in cash, whereas the son wants to muscle his way out as fast as possible. This niggle of disrespect lends the film a nervous litheness; we want the monster quelled, and order restored, but what, exactly, is so peaceful about the status quo?\\n\\nAll of which leads to the director’s fourth and most unlikely virtue: he makes you laugh. Moreover, he keeps doing so in the wrong—or, at any rate, the least laughable—places. This was demonstrated in his earlier movie “Memories of Murder” (2003), in which detectives and forensic experts arriving to study a corpse kept slipping on an embankment and landing on their behinds, like extras in a Mack Sennett comedy. Many graceful directors—Jacques Tati, obviously, but also Krzysztof Kieslowski—have been drawn to the sheer gracelessness of humanity, as if there were something endearing in our habit of falling (or tumbling) short of that noble dignity which, when sitting comfortably, we like to ascribe to ourselves. The most destabilizing scene in “The Host” comes as Gang-du and the others wail with grief before a photograph of Hyun-seo, whom they believe to be dead, and make such a spectacle of themselves, writhing like eels, that despite ourselves we snicker at their collapse. Such maladroit behavior is unusual in a monster flick, where you expect at least a modicum of cool; you can’t really imagine Sigourney Weaver, at the climax of “Aliens,” tripping over her own flamethrower.\\n\\nGiven all that, it may seem perverse to hail “The Host” as a thing of beauty, yet that is what it is: a perfect mixture of the silly and the grave. In 1954, the art critic David Sylvester, impatient with the accepted canon, wrote a review of “Them!,” in Encounter, in which he described it as “a frightening, imaginative, beautifully written B-movie-style SF film about giant ants, exactly the sort of film the professional critics could be guaranteed not to latch on to.” Time to make amends. We have shifted from ants to tadpoles (“The Host” could easily have been titled “It!”), but the style is intact. Take the gorgeous wide shot of the Han River, early in the film, with rain gusting across the surface and a hint of something more than murky stirring in its depths. Then leapfrog to the last scene: we are back at Gang-du’s food stand, after dark, with adult and child sharing a heaped table of food. On the television, there is news about the beast—a report, voiced by American officials, about the unseemly events in Seoul. The feasters in the shack, who, after all, were principal players in that drama, want nothing more to do with it: “Should we watch something else?” “Let’s turn it off. Concentrate on eating.” The whole flustered panoply of TV, camera crews, and cell phones that has flashed and clicked throughout the movie is turned off, making way for a glimpse of an older, more peaceable Korea. We move outside for a closing image worthy of Fellini: the small hut, so light and festive within, warmed by the steam of rice, is marooned in a landscape of night and drifting snow. Anything could be out there.\\n\\n'"

       "'\\n\"The Host\" isn\\'t just a terrific monster movie. This South Korean box-office smash is also a laugh-out-loud comedy and a surprisingly angry political satire.\\n\\nIt starts when the U.S. Army dumps hundreds of gallons of toxic formaldehyde in Seoul\\'s Han River. (The officer in charge wants to tidy up the lab, you see.)\\n\\nFlash-forward six years: A giant walking trout-monster -- a literal land shark -- leaps out of the river in broad daylight . . . and starts munching on Korean consumers.\\n\\n Advertisement\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\nThe monster was designed by Weta Workshop, which did design work on \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. As directed by Bong Joon-ho, the creature attack is one of the best ever staged -- a ballet of mass panic with pulsing music matching the monster\\'s rhythmic gait. It\\'s brilliant, terrifying and weirdly funny.\\n\\nIt also leaves you wondering: Why was the monster fully revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie?\\n\\nThe answer: Because it\\'s a prelude to the real horror, as \"The Host\" turns into a satire of government misinformation and corruption that plays like \"Godzilla\" crossed with \"Dr. Strangelove.\"\\n\\nAfter the attack, a dim-bulb single dad named Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) gets a cell phone call from his 13-year-old daughter. The girl was dragged underwater by the monster and presumed dead -- but she\\'s actually hiding in the beast\\'s sewer lair.\\n\\nIt\\'s joyful news: The monster is stupid, the call can be traced and the army\\'s already on the scene. But Park can\\'t get government bureaucrats to believe him and mount a rescue.\\n\\n\"She\\'s deceased, but she\\'s not dead!\" Park screams. A flunky replies that a cell phone trace is \"not something we do for just anyone.\" Instead, officials get hung up on the idea that the monster spreads a virus -- and do little more than detain anyone they think might be infected.\\n\\nSoon, Park enlists his bickering family of losers in a vigilante hunt for the monster. The movie does an incredible job juggling laughs, suspense and a deep-seated distrust of bureaucracy.\\n\\n\"The Host\" is wildly entertaining; people who love the genre will get their geek buttons pushed hard by this flick.

    "\"The Host\" isn't just a terrific monster movie. This South Korean box-office smash is also a laugh-out-loud comedy and a surprisingly angry political satire.\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts when the U.S. Army dumps hundreds of gallons of toxic formaldehyde in Seoul's Han River. (The officer in charge wants to tidy up the lab, you see.)\n",

    "Flash-forward six years: A giant walking trout-monster -- a literal land shark -- leaps out of the river in broad daylight . . . and starts munching on Korean consumers.\n",

    "The monster was designed by Weta Workshop, which did design work on \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. As directed by Bong Joon-ho, the creature attack is one of the best ever staged -- a ballet of mass panic with pulsing music matching the monster's rhythmic gait. It's brilliant, terrifying and weirdly funny.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also leaves you wondering: Why was the monster fully revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer: Because it's a prelude to the real horror, as \"The Host\" turns into a satire of government misinformation and corruption that plays like \"Godzilla\" crossed with \"Dr. Strangelove.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "After the attack, a dim-bulb single dad named Park Gang-du (Song Kang-ho) gets a cell phone call from his 13-year-old daughter. The girl was dragged underwater by the monster and presumed dead -- but she's actually hiding in the beast's sewer lair.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's joyful news: The monster is stupid, the call can be traced and the army's already on the scene. But Park can't get government bureaucrats to believe him and mount a rescue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"She's deceased, but she's not dead!\" Park screams. A flunky replies that a cell phone trace is \"not something we do for just anyone.\" Instead, officials get hung up on the idea that the monster spreads a virus -- and do little more than detain anyone they think might be infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon, Park enlists his bickering family of losers in a vigilante hunt for the monster. The movie does an incredible job juggling laughs, suspense and a deep-seated distrust of bureaucracy.\n",
    "\n",
