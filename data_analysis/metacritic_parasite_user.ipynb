So I didn't know what to expect when I begun watching this film. I saw it with a blank slate, with no preformed opinion whatsoever. The only time I had seen a Korean film before was The Train to Busan, and that too is made by Bong Joon-Ho. I had watched it from somewhere in the middle when it was coming on TV. So in a way we can consider this is the first Korean film that I watched.Parasite is a film that makes us feel uncomfortable on purpose. It makes us think what we will do in a situation like this. The Kim family is in a desparate need of money, and the son in the house gets a fake degree to teach at a rich family's house. He learns about the whole family and slowly manipulates the mistress of the house into hiring his other family members over there. Afterwards the family starts getting the already existing servants fired over false accusations and completely takes over the house.Things don't go too well for the Kim family, as one day they decide to live in the mansion while the Park family is away. And then the previous cook comes back and finds out that all of them are the members of the same family. To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hidingThe only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal.Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come.â€¦ Expand\"}]"

To hide this, they fight and accidentally kill her, and it's at that very moment the Park family comes back.nThey had to hide under their table for the night and then find the perfect opportunity to escape. Later at Dae-Woo's birthday the cook's husband comes out of his hiding and kills Ki-Jung. The family is completely separated, with Ki-Taek hiding in the same basement where the cook's husband was hidingThe only part about this film I don't like is when Ki-Taek kills Mr Park. There are many people defending this part saying that it was the last straw and that Ki-Taek had no more control over his emotions, but this scene would have made sense only if either Ki-Taek was shown to be mentally unstable from the beginning, or if Mr Park hated Ki-Taek for some really deep reason other than his body smell. Nothing justifies his this act. But other than that I liked everything about this movie - the uneasy feelings that it was able to invoke, the acting, the dialogues, the story most of all, everything is phenomenal.Parasite completely lives up to being the Oscar winner that it is. Although it's for a mature audience, I won't mind showing it to someone who hasn't watched it already. It's a masterpiece that deserves the popularity it got and Bong Joon-Ho shall be remembered for it for days to come.â€¦ Expand\"}]"
