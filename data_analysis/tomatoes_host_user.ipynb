    "# Scraping Rotten Tomatoes for User Reviews of _The Host_\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, I will work on scraping user reviews of _The Host_ on [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_host_2007/reviews?type=user&intcmp=rt-scorecard_audience-score-reviews). After scraping these user reviews, I will also filter by date to include only reviews posted between 2007 and 2009 (which I explain further down below). "

This is because I want to analyze audience reviews that were posted within the first two years of the movie's release. That way, these reviews would not be affected by more recent hype around Director Bong Joon Ho's work. Instead, reviews that are most closely posted to the release date would reflect more authentic reviews on the movie. Additionally, this works well because _Parasite_ was released in 2019, which means at the time I am completing this project in 2021, it has been 2 years since that movie came out. Thus, for the audience reviews, this evens out the time between the film's release date and when the reviews are posted.\n",
