    "# Scraping Rotten Tomatoes for User Reviews of _Parasite_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I work on scraping, cleaning, and extracting reviews of _Parasite_ from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/parasite_2019/reviews?type=verified_audience&intcmp=rt-scorecard_audience-score-reviews). Going through the same process as the one in the `tomatoes_host_user` notebook, I compile these user reviews so I can carry out analysis on them to understand what audience users have said about these movies!"

       "  'text': 'This film begins with the image of a pile of socks drying near the narrow window of Ki-Taek\\'s house. He lives on an \"intermediate floor\", a kind of basement whose view overlooks a trash can where a homeless person urinates. The four family members are constantly dirty, moving between cramped rooms as they search for a free Wi-Fi network in the neighborhood. The description of this family is grotesque, just as the bourgeois description of the Park family will be grotesque. The latter inhabit the spacious house created by a famous architect, where the four members are scattered around the rooms and get bored with all the technology and objects at their disposal. The two cores are identical opposites (father, mother, daughter and son), like the reflection of a mirror.\\nDirector Bong Joon-ho moves on to a caricature view of the social classes, whose stratification is represented by the literal structure of the houses - see the rich man\\'s house, the poor\\'s middle floor and a basement, an even more precarious level that will play an important role in the plot. While the Park\\'s wealth makes them naive and ignorant (no curiosity for the world around them due to the ease of their possessions), the protagonists\\' poverty motivates trickery, the ability to create all possible tricks to ascend socially. It does not take long before families meet and the unemployed manage to infiltrate the wealthy house, one by one, gaining the trust of new employers. The notion of parasitism suggested by the title works perfectly to describe the central conflict.\\nThe first half of the narrative is a delightful comic farce. The plans devised by father (Song Kang-ho), mother (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter (Park So-dam) and son (Choi Woo-sik) are as simple as they are hilarious, working only thanks to the Park\\'s innocence. The director is not deprived of creating really exaggerated scenes, betting on physical humor and the blows of destiny that contribute to the success of the mission. The viewer needs to show a high degree of indulgence to believe in some of the twists and turns, as well as certain elements of suspense introduced along the way. Joon-ho is much more interested in the symbolic value of the actions and characters than in the verisimilitude of the plot, which becomes an allegorical fable of ants and cicadas, foxes and chickens.\\nFortunately, as suspense sets in, Parasite takes the precaution of expanding the social scope and visiting other families in a situation as precarious as that of the protagonists. This is the time to reveal the different ways of dealing with difficulties, so that the parasitism of Ki-Taek and her family is not seen as the only possible way out. The flood scene proves to be particularly effective in affecting the lower floors while preserving the upper floors. Aesthetically, the project demonstrates the pragmatic elegance of the director, who never sacrifices understanding in the name of beauty. The filmmaker proves an excellent mastery of tones, directing the scribe, the touching drama and the dark suspense in different, yet organic and permeable ways.\\nFinally, it is not surprising that the narrative leads to tragedy. The script sees violence as the only possible outcome for the clash between extreme poverty and ostentatious wealth, between the boss\\'s hypocritical education (who even likes the employees, despite having a \"subway smell\") and the restrained aggressiveness of the employees. The film builds a time bomb, accentuating differences and social injustices until it explodes in a bloody climax. In this way, it allegorically represents the class struggle, the ideas of possession and appropriation in the contemporary era. It is commendable that the text dedicates a privileged space for cell phones, \"gourmet balconies\", the back rooms - so many elements representative of the times in which we live.\\nWhen the son is faced with a serious problem, he tries to put himself in the place of the rich friend: \"What would Min do in this situation?\", he asks. Her sister replies: \"Min would never be in this situation\". Perhaps this is the best summary of the tragicomic discourse, according to which social mobility is an illusion, and Hollywood dreams of affective reconciliation between rich and poor deserve to be ridiculed. For a family to occupy the Park home, the ultimate symbol of success, it is necessary for another family to leave, even if it is by force. To ascend to the top of the pyramid, the only way is war.'}]"
