# My data story for COMM313 _Computational Text Analysis_ Final Project

You have now arrived at the end of my project! As a reminder, throughout my research, I explored the following questions:

### How does the American public rate _Parasite_ (2019) compared to _The Host_ (2007)? Through sentiment analysis, what can we conclude about American sentiment towards these two South Korean movies?

Overall, it seems that my hypothesis is supported: Based on the movie reviews I analyzed, _Parasite_ has been more well-received (more positive ratings, higher positive sentiment scores) than _The Host_ !

My research and data analysis has culminatined into a final data story, which is in the form of a data-driven blog article.

I have published my story on Medium.com, and my target audience is broad, but in general can include anyone interested in Director Bong Joon-Ho, South Korean film and entertainment, American public movie review sites, sentiment analysis, or broad data science/visualization. I hope this can open up more conversations around international films and that the American public can embrace diverse origins and genres of cinema.

In case there are any issues with accessing this Medium link, I also uploaded my story as a PDF File in this folder.

Thank you very much for your time, energy, and attention. I hope you enjoyed my final project!

Gratefully,

Mary
