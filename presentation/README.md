# Progress presentation for COMM313 Final Project

Welcome! In this folder, I have one notebook that contains my brief mid-progress presentation that I gave in class about my project. The notebook is in the format of presentation slides, and has the following information: 

* Introduction - research question and hypothesis
* Data collection - explanation of how I collected my data so far, descriptives, and dimensions
* Initial data analysis and results - display of truncated analysis steps and code: dividing the data into positive and negative reviews, sentiment analysis using VADER; and the results of these analyses
* Next steps - plans for where to collect more data (Rotten Tomatoes), other analyses to run and sub-hypotheses to think about
